We'll see.They're having a lot of problems not only with us; they're having problems within their own country. And I think they have a lot of self-made problems.We are by far the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds but plenty of time. Plenty of time.In the meantime they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say Oh you should go in immediately. And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing. And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States what's good for our allies.

I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination. We've brought many people home and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing I find with hostages. It's really something.I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family an incredible family—the whole family and some of Otto's friends in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night. And we did that dinner in Otto—really in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing.The First Lady and I it was very—you know it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that. Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time.You've got to move fast. With hostages you have to move fast. All of a sudden it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes it's just too late. In the case of Otto it was very late. We got him home but he was in horrible horrible condition. What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well—I actually work hard on hostages I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that but I do. These are great—I guess in almost all cases—American lives. And we help other people also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation where we have some strength that they don't.But these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt—we got them home. We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdogan was very good. And we got a hostage home who—our great pastor who everyone in this room knows and loves.But we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position—it's a very critical time—I had so many people—I shouldn't say this in front of Robert he'll be embarrassed but I had so many people that called me and they recommended Robert O'Brien.

Yes, I think he will. But I think he'll pay a serious and dear price for it that he doesn't think now will cost him what it's going to cost him. And I think he will regret having done it.Now, whether or not—I think that—how can I say this in a public forum? I think that he is dealing with what I believe he thinks is the most tragic thing that's happened to Mother Russia—in that the Berlin Wall came down, the empire has been lost, the near abroad is gone, et cetera. The Soviet Union has been split.But think about what he has. He has eight time zones, a burning tundra that will not freeze again naturally, a situation where he has a lot of oil and gas, but he is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west.And so I'm not so sure that he has—David, I'm not so sure he has—is certain what he's going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.And by the way, I've indicated to him—the two things he said to me that he wants guarantees of: One is, Ukraine will never be part of NATO. And two, that NATO, or the—there will not be strategic weapons stationed in Ukraine. Well, we could work out something on the second piece, depending what he does along the Russian line as well—or the Russian border, in the European area of Russia.On the first piece, we have a number of treaties internationally and in Europe that suggest that you get to choose who you want to be with. But the likelihood that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the near term is not very likely, based on much more work they have to do in terms of democracy and a few other things going on there and whether or not the major allies in the west would vote to bring Ukraine in right now.So there's room to work if he wants to do that.

{"sentence": " What in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024? [SEP] Nothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is.Do you know anybody who wants us to get rid of the change we made on prescription drug prices and raise prices again? Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and the internet and so on? I don't know any—I think that the problem is, the major pieces of legislation we passed—and some of it bipartisan—takes time to be recognized.For example, you've got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in—up in Scranton, Pennsylvania—the Congressman who got elected. And he said, Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York—New York City? I said: Yes, we can. We can.First of all, it will make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there—we voted for—than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with.And it's the same way—for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year.So there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving.So I'm not going to change—as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I wanted to change and add to. For example, we've—had passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation—you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And—but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil—so I'm not going to change the direction.I said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm—and I know—I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay?One is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are starting—the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more—more—how can I say it?—decent.Second thing I said was, I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hard-working folks.And the third thing—I know is still very hard—I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country. It's hard to sustain yourself as a leading democracy in the world if you can't generate some unity.So I'm not going to change anything in any fundamental way.", "label": "Explicit"}

Somewhere between $100 and $200 billion of capital flight has taken place. You're not seeing a lot of investors coming in new to start businesses inside of Russia.And it has presented the choice to President Putin as to whether he is going to try to resolve the issues in eastern Ukraine through diplomacy and peaceful means, recognizing that Ukraine is a sovereign country and that it is up ultimately to the Ukrainian people to make decisions about their own lives; or alternatively, continue on the course that he's on, in which case, he's going to be hurting his economy and hurting his own people over the long term.And in that sense, we are doing exactly what we should be doing. And we're very pleased that our European allies and partners joined us in this process, as well as a number of countries around the world.Having said all that, the issue is not resolved yet. You still have fighting in eastern Ukraine. Civilians are still dying. We've already seen some of the consequences of this conflict in the loss of the Malaysian Airlines airline—or jetliner.And the sooner that we can get back on a track in which there are serious discussions taking place to assure that all Ukrainians are heard, that they can work through the political process, that they're represented, that the reforms that have already been offered by the Government in Kiev are implemented to protect Russian speakers, to assure decentralization of power—the sooner that we move on those, and the sooner that President Putin recognizes that Ukraine is an independent country, it's only at that point where we can say that the problem has truly been solved.

I want to talk about the substance of because there's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened.Muammar Qadhafi, who, prior to Usama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect--provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interests and also because it's the right thing to do.We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies--who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations--have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in ; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the Members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics.And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down, and the noose is tightening around him.Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers Resolution, it came up after the Vietnam war in which we had half a million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent, and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments, you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": " What responsibility do you think the democratic countries of Latin America have in helping Cuba transition to a democratic system [SEP] The goal of any government should be to create security for its citizens and to give them opportunity to achieve prosperity and to pass that prosperity on to their kids. And I'm a strong believer that the free market is the best tool ever invented to create wealth.But what's true in every country is that we always have to think about whether every single person is getting a fair shot, where they actually have opportunity. Is everybody doing their fair share to support the common efforts that are required to create a platform for growth? Is everybody playing by the same set of rules? And I think the history of the United States, the reason we became an economic superpower is because--not always perfectly, not always consistently, but better than any other country on Earth--we were able to give opportunity to everybody. That's what the American Dream was all about.So when we have debates now about our tax policy, when we have debates now about the Buffett rule that we've been talking about, where we say if you make a million dollars a year or more you shouldn't pay a lower tax rate than your secretary, that is not an argument about redistribution. That is an argument about growth. Because the history of the United States is we grow best when our growth is broad-based. We grow best when our middle class is strong. We grow best when everybody has opportunity. And that means that somebody who has a great idea and is selling a great product or service, we want them to get rich. That's great. But we also want to make sure that we as a society are investing in that young kid who comes from a poor family, who has incredible talent and might be able to get rich as well.And that means we've got to build good schools, and we've got to make sure that that child can go to college. And we also want to make sure that we keep our scientific edge, and that means we've got to invest in basic research. And that means that we've got to have some basic safety net, because people are more willing to take risks that are required for the free market to work if they know that if they fall on hardship, if something happens, that there's still some floor that they can't fall beneath and that they'll be able to retire with some dignity and some respect.And so one of the things that we're going to be talking about over the next several months as we debate the budget and Government spending and the proper role of Government, is just--I want everybody to remember, I'm going to say this repeatedly--this is not an argument about taking from A to give to B. This is not a redistributionist argument that we're making. We're making an argument about how do we grow the economy so that it's going to be prospering in this competitive 21st-century environment. And the only way we're going to do that is if people like me, who have been incredibly blessed, are willing to give a little bit back so that the next generation coming along can succeed as well. And the more people that succeed, the better off the country is going to be.With respect to the Iranian talks, I've been very clear on this. Iran has violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. They're the only country that's a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, that cannot convince the international community that they are abiding by the rules governing the NPT. And not just the United States, but the world community is now imposing some of the toughest sanctions that we've ever seen, and there are more to come. And it is my view that it would be contrary to the security interests of the United States and destabilizing for the world and the region, if Iran pursues, develops, obtains a nuclear weapon. So I've been very clear, and I've been talking about this quite a bit lately.What I've also been clear about is that the best way to resolve this issue is diplomatically and my belief that we still have a window in which to resolve this conflict diplomatically. That window is closing, and Iran needs to take advantage of it. But it is absolutely the right thing to do for the U.S. Government, working in concert with the other permanent members of the Security Council, with Germany, with the rest of the world community, to pursue this path.Part of the reason we've been able to build a strong international coalition that isolates Iran around the nuclear issue is because the world has confidence that I've been sincere and my administration has been sincere about giving Iran an opportunity to pursue peaceful nuclear energy while foreclosing the pursuit of a nuclear weapon. That strengthens our hand. That's part of the reason why we've been able to execute on these strong sanctions. And we're going to keep on seeing if we make progress.Now, the clock is ticking. And I've been very clear to Iran and to our negotiating partners that we're not going to have these talks just drag out in a stalling process. But so far, at least, we haven't given away anything other than the opportunity for us to negotiate and see if Iran comes to the table in good faith. And the notion that somehow we've given something away or a freebie would indicate that Iran has gotten something. In fact, they've got some of the toughest sanctions that they're going to be facing coming up in just a few months if they don't take advantage of these talks. I hope they do.Was there a--you guys ask too many questions. I start forgetting. Any foreign policy has a formula: Interests plus principles equals a foreign policy. So how do you combine these interests and principles, and how you defend those principles is what makes a foreign policy. In our case and in the case of many countries--countries that believe in freedom and democracy--we have the obligation to make sure that those principles are applied in every form possible and in every place possible.But there are different formulas to defend and apply those principles as well. There are certain paths that are more effective than others. In some cases, sanctions may work. Generally, they don't, but they may work in some cases. In some other cases, it has been proven that sanctions are not the solution, and in these cases, we need to then pursue the defense of those principles through other ways.And in our case, Colombia and other Latin American countries that believe in democracy and believe in freedom, we have the obligation to pursue those principles following the most effective paths. And I believe that that can yield the best results. Thank you very much, everybody. .", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": " Can the U.S. expect a surge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan? [SEP] Part of the review is to assess how best to make sure our coalition partners realize there is a coherent strategy of which they are an integral part, all aiming to make sure that there is a presence that will assure the Afghan Government and the Afghan people that people will be trying to help them with their security.It is—it makes sense for us to constantly review our strategies in a variety of theaters. That's what good governance is: You analyze the situation a year after the previous strategy to determine whether or not—what worked and what didn't work. What did work was the—you might remember last year; I guess there was a lot of talk about the Taliban surge or the Taliban offensive. And General McNeill informed us that the only team that's going to be on the offense is American and NATO allies and other allies.And we were on the offense. And the Taliban got hit hard last year. The question, of course, is—just like in Iraq—is there a followup to the security gains? In other words, is life changing better for the average citizen? That's the question that we all got to be looking at. Unity governments are important, but does the average citizen realize that a free society is in his or her interest.And I visited with President Karzai on the SVTS the other day, and it's a question I basically asked him. I said, we were successful militarily; what's happened in your country that you can point to that indicates that you're taking advantage of better security in certain places?And he pointed out some interesting things. He talked about the—I think it's 5 million children now going to school. It was an interesting measurement for him. He says, I believe we're taking advantage of the security because more of our children are getting educated. He told us a story—I can't remember the exact Province—about when he was part of the struggle against the Taliban. Somebody got wounded; he took them to the hospital— there was nothing there. You know, it was like they called it a hospital. It was just kind of a rundown place where a person couldn't get much good health care. And now, all of a sudden, he talks about an expanding health care system and the infant mortality rate dropping. He talks about the roads that are being built so that the average citizen there can get their crops to market. And we checked into his assertions, and they're true. So this is a society where—that is evolving.Now, it takes a while for societies that have been brutalized by tyranny and wracked by war to meet expectations. So the questions I ask on Iraq and Afghanistan are: Is there progress? Are people feeling better about life? And of course, we press their governments to work to come together and get budgets passed, or in Iraq's case, de-Ba'athification law or oil laws. And those are all important.

[SEP] Well, on the specific question of how we can work with the Chilean Government, any requests that are made by Chile to obtain more information about the past is something that we will certainly consider, and we would like to cooperate. I think it's very important for all of us to know our history. And obviously, the history of relations between the United States and Latin America have at times been extremely rocky and have at times been difficult.I think it's important, though, for us, even as we understand our history and gain clarity about our history, that we're not trapped by our history. And the fact of the matter is, is that over the last two decades, we've seen extraordinary progress here in Chile, and that has not been impeded by the United States, but, in fact, has been fully supported by the United States.So I can't speak to all of the policies of the past. I can speak certainly to the policies of the present and the future. And as President of the United States, what I know is that our firm commitment to democracy, our firm commitment to eradicating poverty, our full commitment to broad-based and socially inclusive development, our full support of the robust, open markets that have developed here in Chile and the work that and his predecessor, President Bachelet, have done in order to transform the economic situation here--those are all things that the United States strongly supports.And so again, it's important for us to learn from our history, to understand our history, but not be trapped by it, because we've got a lot of challenges now, and even more importantly, we have challenges in the future that we have to attend to.", "label": "Dodging"}

And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles.

The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do.

I really would be happy if that was the case. Because my understanding, as far as politics is concerned, and carrying for the matters of your country is similar to the view of Mr. Mr. Trump is saying America first, and I'm saying, Poland first. So we understand each other very well.And it is hard for me to be surprised with the fact that Mr. President being a very experienced man—a man of success, as far as business is concerned—knows how to calculate. He knows how to calculate, and I think nobody puts that into question either in the U.S. or in another place. And he takes care of the United States. It lies in the interest of the country to have a balanced trade exchange, and this is something that you have to take care of. And of course, there is a clash of interest. However, objectively looking, it is hard not to understand it.So there is always competition of interest. There is—every kind of business is a competition of interests. And I represent Polish interests, whereas President Trump represents American interests. The whole thing is as follows: On important matters, you have to strike an agreement to make sure that both countries wins and lose as little as possible. And then, we have an understanding, an agreement. And then, we can say that we are cooperating with each other on equal level. And I believe this is the kind of cooperation that Mr. President would like to have with the European Union. And it is—it will be hard to be surprised with that.I'm listening kindly to that, and I would like Poland to be such a country, such an economic superpower, that it would be a very important partner to the United States. I said jokingly, in the beginning, that I wish it was Poland which disturbed the trade balance of the United States and our exports to the United States, but I do believe that our cooperation is going to develop well on partners, like principles. The trade deal with South Korea has been fully renegotiated and is ready for signature. We may sign it at the United Nations or shortly thereafter. That was a terrible deal for the United States.

You just said the price of gasoline may be up to $4 a gallon—or some expert told you that—and that creates a lot of uncertainty. If you're out there wondering whether or not—you know, what your life is going to be like and you're looking at $4 a gallon, that's uncertain. And when you couple that with the idea that your taxes may be going up in a couple of years, that's double uncertainty. And therefore, one way to deal with uncertainty is for Congress to make the tax cuts permanent.Secondly, it's—people got to understand that our energy policies needs to be focused on a lot of things: one, renewables, which is fine, which I strongly support, as you know; two, conservation. But we need to be finding more oil and gas at home if we're worried about becoming independent—dependent on oil overseas. And this—I view it as a transitory period to new technologies that'll change the way we live. But we haven't built a refinery in a long time. We're expanding refineries, but we haven't built a refinery in a long time. I strongly suggested to the Congress that we build refineries on old military bases, but no, it didn't pass. But if you've got less supply of something as demand continues to stay steady or grow, your price is going to go up.Secondly, on oil, we—the more oil we find at home, the better off we're going to be in terms of the short run. And yet our policy is, you know, let us not explore robustly in places like ANWR. And there are environmental concerns, and I understand that. I also know there's technologies that should mitigate these environmental concerns.They got a bill up there in Congress now. Their attitude is, let's tax oil companies. Well, all that's going to do is make the price even higher. We ought to be encouraging investment in oil and gas close to home if we're trying to mitigate the problems we face right now.And so yes, there's a lot of uncertainty, and I'm concerned about the uncertainty. Hopefully, this progrowth package will help—this 100—I think it's $147 billion that will be going out the door, starting electronically in the first week of May and through check in the second week of May.

I think that in this day and age, there are going to be--there is always going to be the potential for an individual or a small group of individuals, if they are willing to die, to kill other people. Some of them are going to be very well organized, and some of them are going to be random. That threat is there. And it's important, I think, for the American people to understand that and not to live in fear. It's just a reality of today's world that there are going to be threats out there.We have, I think, greatly improved our homeland security since 9/11 occurred. I am constantly impressed with the dedication that our teams apply to this problem. They are chasing down every thread, not just from Al Qaida, but any other actor out there that might be engaging in terrorism. They are making sure that even a--what might appear to be a lone individual who has very little organizational capacity--if they make a threat, they follow up.But one of the things that I want to make sure we do as long as I'm President and beyond my Presidency is to understand America's strength in part comes from its resilience, and that we don't start losing who we are or overreacting if, in fact, there is the threat of terrorism out there.We go about our business. We are tougher than them. Our families and our businesses and our churches and mosques and synagogues and our Constitution, our values, that's what gives us strength. And we are going to have this problem out there for a long time to come. But it doesn't have to completely distort us. And it doesn't have to dominate our foreign policy.

[]No, that's a legitimate question, and the question is, why now? Why do I think something positive can happen? Well, first of all, the legislative process takes awhile in the United States. I don't know about Mexico, Mr. President, but sometimes legislators, you know, debate issues for awhile before a solution can be achieved.And we had a very—by the way, we haven't had a serious debate on migration until recently. A law was passed in 1986, and then there really wasn't a serious debate until pretty much starting after the year 2000, if my memory serves me well. I've always known this is an important issue because I happened to have been the Governor of Texas. And so I'm very comfortable about discussing the issue and have elevated the issue over the past years. And Members of Congress have taken the issue very seriously, but it's hard to get legislation out of the Congress on a very complex issue.A lot of Americans were deeply concerned that the United States was not enforcing our laws. They felt like there wasn't a commitment to the rule of law. Over the past year, I believe we have shown the American people that there is a strong commitment to the rule of law. And I think Members of Congress are now feeling more comfortable that the country is committed to rule of law, which then makes some more openminded to my argument, which is that if we can have migration reform, it will make it less likely somebody will feel like they have to sneak across our border, and, therefore, take pressure off the border. In other words, security for the country, border security, will be enhanced by a good migration law, and then it will make it easier for us to focus our assets on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns moving both ways.I believe—I feel pretty good about it. I don't want to predict legislative successes. But I can tell you my mood, and my mood is optimistic because the mood in the Congress seems like it has changed from skepticism last year to knowledge that getting a comprehensive bill will be in the Nation's interests.Secondly, I'm optimistic because Republicans in the Senate are working with Democrats in the Senate. We're facilitating that work. The administration is very much involved with helping the Senators find common ground, to the point where we can move a bill as quickly as possible out of the Senate so it gets to the House of Representatives.I'm not a betting man. I don't like to bet, because when I do, I usually lose. But I'm an optimistic man, in this case, about getting comprehensive reform, and a bill is in the interests of both countries.

I suspect you'll find, on the one hand; on the other hand, in how they predict. []Now, what I focus on are the fundamentals of our economy. My belief is that people will make rational decision based upon facts. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. I mentioned some of them before. Job creation is strong; real after-tax wages are on the rise; inflation is low. Interestingly enough, the global economy is strong, which has enabled us to gain more exports, which helped the second-quarter growth numbers to be robust at 3.4 percent.Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system. In other words, is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct? And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct.

Certainly, we discussed Darfur, as we discussed other problem areas, especially on our continent. And I do want to agree with the President; problems are there. But I think the best approach is, indeed, to help Africans develop their capacity to deal with these problems. And more importantly, as the President said, we probably also have to invest our time and even resources in the monitoring and also preventing problems coming up, as they keep coming up in different places.But it is important to understand that, indeed, today we'll have Darfur; maybe tomorrow there will be another problem area, God forbid. But it's important that these problems are not to be seen as if they have to be resolved, attended to, by the United States. They must be attended to by the international community. They must also be attended to by people, if it is in Africa, by Africans. Primarily, they must develop this capacity. And they should be supported to develop this capacity so that we can prevent and we are prepared to prevent. Then you should be able to cope with these challenges, resolving the problems.So I think the approach taken by President Bush were realistic, in the sense that you also do not want to see every problem, United States being called upon to be the answer of that problem. And of course, we—the backlash, also, in the sense that, at the same time, they also start blaming the United States, that they are rushing everywhere solving problems and, of course, reading through that to mean they have other interests and so on and so forth.So I think that will lead the way of helping the people to solve their own problems, but of course, with the support of the United States with its huge capabilities in different areas. And walking together with the rest of the international community is perhaps more important than just blaming the United States, saying, Why didn't you go in and solve the problem? The problems and the solutions to those problems should not be taken away from the responsibilities of their action, should not be taken away from places where they're taking place and the people in those places.I think that is the best way I could— but we did talk about that.

In other words, part of the issue, Peter, is the practical issue of what do we do with the people?And you say nothing has taken place. I strongly disagree with that. First of all, we are working with other nations to send folks back. Again, it's a fairly steep order. A lot of people don't want killers in their midst, and a lot of these people are killers. Secondly, of course, we want to make sure that when we do send them back, they're treated as humanely as possible.The other issue was whether or not we can get people to be tried. One of the things I'm anxious about, want to see happen, is that there to be trials. Courts have been involved with deciding how to do this, and Defense is trying to work out mechanisms to get the trials up and running.

Well, it means we work in ways to deal with 21st-century problems, such as proliferation of nuclear materials, such as working to make sure our children are educated with the tools necessary to be productive citizens, such as having a recognition that in the 21st century, a free and fair trading system will be necessary for prosperity.

But I think what's happened over the last several weeks is not a victory for me, it's a victory for the American people. And the lesson I hope that everybody takes from this is that it's possible for Democrats and Republicans to have principled disagreements, to have some lengthy arguments, but to ultimately find common ground to move the country forward.That's what we did with taxes. Those arguments have not gone away. I still believe that it doesn't make sense for us to provide tax cuts to people like myself who don't need them when our deficit and debts are growing. That's a debate that's going to continue into 2011, and I know the Republicans feel just as strongly on the other side of that.I think that we're still going to have disagreements in terms of spending priorities. It's vital for us to make investments in education and research and development--all those things that create an innovative economy--while at the same time cutting those programs that just aren't working. And there are going to be debates between the parties on those issues.But what we've shown is that we don't have to agree on a hundred percent to get things done that enhance the lives of families all across America. And if we can sustain that spirit, then regardless of how the politics play out in 2012, the American people will be better for it.

{"sentence": " Are you worried about your own powers of persuasion and maybe that the American public is not listening to you anymore? [SEP] Well, no. What we've seen is the American people respond very enthusiastically to the specific provisions of the jobs bill. They are very skeptical about Congress's ability to act right now, and that's understandable. The American people are very frustrated. They've been frustrated for a long time. They don't get a sense that folks in this town are looking out for their interests. They get a sense that folks in this town are thinking about their own jobs, their own careers, their own advancement, their party interests. And so if the question is, Chuck, are people feeling cynical and frustrated about the prospects of positive action in this city? Absolutely. And I can go out there and make speeches, but until they actually see action, some of that cynicism is going to be there.As you said, during the debt ceiling debate, a very solid majority, I think maybe even higher than 70 percent, agreed with the approach that I talked about, which was we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.And what the American people saw is that Congress didn't care, not just what I thought, they didn't care about what the American people thought. They had their own agenda. And so if they see that over and over again, that cynicism is not going to be reduced until Congress actually proves their cynicism wrong by doing something that would actually help the American people. This is a great opportunity to do it. This is a great opportunity to do it.And keep in mind, if the American jobs bill passes, we're still going to have challenges. We're still going to have to make sure that we've got the best education system in the world because that is going to be critical for our long-term competitiveness and creating good, solid middle class jobs. We're still going to have to keep investing in basic research and science. We're still going to have to make sure that we do even more on infrastructure. I mean, what's contained in the American jobs bill doesn't cover all the roads and bridges and infrastructure that needs to be improved around the country.So there--so it's not as if that's going to solve all our problems, but it is an important start that we know would end up growing the economy and putting hundreds of thousands, millions of people back to work at a time when they need it the most. And it's paid for.The one persuasive argument that the Republicans previously had made against a bill like this is the deficit is growing, we can't afford it. Well, we can afford it if we're willing to ask people like me to do a little bit more in taxes. We can afford it without affecting our deficit. Our proposal is paid for. So that can't be the excuse.And so yes, until they see Congress actually putting country ahead of party politics and partisanship, they're going to be skeptical.

{"sentence": " How does the increased U.S. military operations in Africa square with the contention that America cannot be at war forever? [SEP] Well, if you look at the speech I gave at the National Defense College several months ago, I outlined how I saw the shift in terrorism around the world and what we have to do to respond to it. And part of what I said is, is that we had decimated core Al aida that had been operating primarily between Afghanistan and Pakistan, but you now had these regional groups, some of which are explicitly tied to Al aida or that ideology, some of which are more localized. Few of them have the ability to project beyond their borders, but they can do a lot of damage inside their borders.And Africa is one of the places where, because, in some cases, a lack of capacity on the part of the Governments, in some cases because it is easier for folks to hide out in vast terrains that are sparsely populated, that you're seeing some of these groups gather. And we're going to have to continue to go after them.But there's a difference between us going after terrorists who are plotting directly to do damage to the United States and us being involved in wars. The risks of terrorism and terrorist networks are going to continue for some time to come. We've got to have a long-term plan that is not just military based, we've got to engage in a war of ideas in the region and engage with Muslim countries and try to isolate radical elements that are doing more damage to Muslims than they're doing to anybody else. We've got to think about economic development, because although there's not a direct correlation between terrorism and the economy, there's no doubt that if you've got a lot of unemployed, uneducated young men in societies, that there's a greater likelihood that terrorist recruits are available.But where you've got active plots and active networks, we're going to go after them. We prefer partnering with countries where this is taking place wherever we can, and we want to build up their capacity. But we're not going to farm out our defense.And I have to say, by the way, the operations that took place both in Libya and Somalia were examples of the extraordinary skill and dedication and talent of our men and women in the armed forces.

{"sentence": "Do you hold yourself totally blameless in the inability to reach agreement with the Republican-led House? [SEP] Well, Wendell, let's just take the recent example of immigration. A bipartisan bill passed out of the Senate, cosponsored by not just Democrats, but some very conservative Republicans who recognized that the system currently is broken and if in fact we put more resources on the border, provide a path in which those undocumented workers who've been living here for a long time and may have ties here are coming out of the shadows, paying their taxes, paying a fine, learning English—if we fix the legal immigration system so it's more efficient, if we are attracting young people who may have studied here to stay here and create jobs here, that that all is going to be good for the economy, it's going to reduce the deficit, it might have forestalled some of the problems that we're seeing now in the Río Grande Valley with these unaccompanied children.And so we have a bipartisan bill, Wendell, bipartisan agreement supported by everybody from labor to the evangelical community, to law enforcement. So the argument isn't between me and the House Republicans. It's between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans, and House Republicans and the business community, and House Republicans and the evangelical community. I'm just one of the people they seem to disagree with on this issue.So that's on the comprehensive bill. So now we have a short-term crisis with respect to the Río Grande Valley. They say we need more resources, we need tougher border security in this area where these unaccompanied children are showing up. We agree. So we put forward a supplemental to give us the additional resources and funding to do exactly what they say we should be doing, and they can't pass the bill. They can't even pass their own version of the bill. So that's not a disagreement between me and the House Republicans; that's a disagreement between the House Republicans and the House Republicans.The point is that on a range of these issues, whether it's tax reform, whether it's reducing the deficit, whether it's rebuilding our infrastructure, we have consistently put forward proposals that in previous years and previous administrations would not have been considered radical or left-wing; they would have been considered pretty sensible, mainstream approaches to solving problems. I'd include under that, by the way, the Affordable Care Act, but that's a whole other conversation.And in circumstances where even basic, commonsense, plain-vanilla legislation can't pass because House Republicans consider it somehow a compromise of their principles or giving Obama a victory, then we've got to take action.

[SEP] Well, I think that you will see at this summit a broad-based agreement from all countries, including Germany, that we need to ensure balanced and sustainable growth. And it is my expectation that the communique will begin to put in place mechanisms that help us track and encourage such balanced and sustainable growth.The most important thing that the United States can do for the world economy is to grow, because we continue to be the world's largest market and a huge engine for all other countries to grow. Countries like Germany that export heavily benefit from our open markets and us buying their goods. That's true for every G-20 member.And so the point that we have consistently made is that in a prudent, stable way, we want to make sure that we are boosting growth rates at home as well as abroad. It is difficult to do that if we start seeing the huge imbalances redevelop that helped to contribute to the crisis that we just went through. And I don't think this is a controversial proposition. In fact, we set up a framework back in Pittsburgh that discussed this, and this is just a follow-on to the work that we've already done.Now, as I've said, I think, when I was first asked this in India, it's not our habit to comment on actions by the Federal Reserve. But as President of the United States, I can tell you that my instructions to my team, including Secretary Geithner, is to focus every single day on how we can grow our economy, how we can increase exports, how we can make sure that even as we're buying goods from places like South Korea, we're also selling goods to places like South Korea.That's part of the reason why we think that getting this Korea-U.S. free trade agreement done is so important. And President Lee and I discussed this, and our instructions are we're not--we don't want months to pass before we get this done; we want this to be done in a matter of weeks.So bottom line is, Patricia, I think that when you see the final communique, it will reflect a broad-based consensus about the direction that we need to go. There may be on any given--at any given moment disagreements between countries in terms of particular strategies. That's not surprising because each country has unique problems and finds itself in different positions. Countries like Germany historically are very sensitive to issues like inflation. But I don't think you'll get any objection to their belief that if the U.S. isn't growing, that's not good for the rest of the world.It also doesn't negate the fact that if we--if individual countries are engaging in practices that are purposely designed to boost their exports at the expense of others, that that can contribute to problems as opposed to solving them.", "label": "Deflection"}

It would send a contradictory message to a country led by a very strong leader who is working hard to deal with some very difficult problems, one of which is armed gangs of people that are ruthless and brutal, people who just kidnap innocent people for the sake of achieving political objectives.And so a vote for democracy took place, a very strong vote for democracy.

{"sentence": "Can you say as Commander in Chief that the huge human and financial costs of the war in Afghanistan can be justified, given the fact that the Afghanistan that the world will leave behind is somewhat diminished from the vision of reconstruction and democracy that was prevalent at the beginning of the war?\\n [SEP] I want us to remember why we went to Afghanistan. We went into Afghanistan because 3,000 Americans were viciously murdered by a terrorist organization that was operating openly and at the invitation of those who were then ruling Afghanistan.It was absolutely the right thing to do for us to go after that organization, to go after the host Government that had aided and abetted—or at least allowed for these attacks to take place. And because of the heroic work of our men and women in uniform, and because of the cooperation and sacrifices of Afghans who had also been brutalized by that then-host Government, we achieved our central goal, which is—or have come very close to achieving our central goal, which is to decapacitate Al Qaida, to dismantle them, to make sure that they can't attack us again.And everything that we've done over the last 10 years, from the perspective of the U.S. national security interest, have been focused on that aim. And I have—at the end of this conflict, we are going to be able to say that the sacrifices that were made by those men and women in uniform has brought about the goal that we sought.Now, what we also recognized very early on was that it was in our national security interest to have a stable, sovereign Afghanistan that was a responsible international actor, that was in partnership with us, and that that required Afghanistan to have its own security capacity and to be on a path that was more likely to achieve prosperity and peace for its own people. And I think would be the first to acknowledge that Afghanistan still has work to do to accomplish those goals, but there's no doubt that the possibility of peace and prosperity in Afghanistan today is higher than before we went in. And that is also in part because of the sacrifices that the American people have made during this long conflict.So I think that—have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios? Probably not. This is a human enterprise, and you fall short of the ideal. Did we achieve our central goal? And have we been able, I think, to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan Government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States? We have achieved that goal. We are in the process of achieving that goal. And for that, I think we have to thank our extraordinary military, intelligence, and diplomatic teams, as well as the cooperation of the Afghan Government and the Afghan people. . Sir, on the question of corruption, whether it has a foreign element to it, if I have correctly understood your question, there is corruption in Afghanistan. There is corruption in the Afghan Government that we are fighting against, employing various means and methods. We have succeeded in certain ways. But if your question is whether we are satisfied, of course not.And on the corruption that is foreign in origin, but occurring in Afghanistan, I have been very clear and explicit, and I don't think that Afghanistan can see less corruption unless there is cooperation between us and our international partners on correcting some of the methods or applications of delivery of assistance to Afghanistan, without cooperation and without recognition of the problems.On elections, for me, the greatest of my achievements, eventually, seen by the Afghan people, will be a proper, well-organized, interference-free election in which the Afghan people can elect their next President.

{"sentence": " Haven't you betrayed some of the voters who supported you in the election by changing your positions on who should get a tax increase and then by including Social Security benefits now in this mix? [SEP] Well, first of all, there's no reason why we should. Remember what I said during the campaign. I thought that it was important for us to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I said it was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires paid their fair share. I said that we were going to have to make some tough cuts, some tough decisions on the spending side, but what I wouldn't do was hurt vulnerable families, only to pay for a tax cut for somebody like me. And what I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases.That's exactly what I've put forward. What I've said is, is that in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things, some things that some Democrats don't want to see, and probably, there are a few Republicans who don't want to see either. But the only way that we're going to be able to stabilize the economy, make sure we've got a platform for long-term economic growth, that we get our deficits under control and we make sure that middle class families are protected is if we come up with something that members of both parties in Congress can support.And that's the plan that I've put forward. I have gone at least halfway in meeting some of the Republicans' concerns, recognizing that even though we campaigned on these issues, even though the majority of Americans agree with me that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest few as a means of reducing the deficit, I have also said that I'm willing to identify some spending cuts that make sense.And frankly, up until about a couple of days ago, if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner, I think, were in a position to say, we've gotten a fair deal. The fact that they haven't taken it yet is puzzling and, I think, a question that you're going to have to address to them.I remain optimistic, though, because if you look at what the Speaker has proposed, he's conceded that income tax rates should go up, except right now he only wants to have them go up for millionaires. If you're making 900,000, somehow he thinks that you can't afford to pay a little more in taxes. But the principle that rates are going to need to go up he's conceded.I've said I'm willing to make some cuts. What separates us is probably a few hundred billion dollars. The idea that we would put our economy at risk because you can't bridge that gap doesn't make a lot of sense.So I'm going to continue to talk to the Speaker and the other leaders up in Congress. But ultimately, they've got to do their job. Right now their job is to make sure that middle class taxes do not go up and that we have a balanced, responsible package of deficit reduction.It is there for all to see. It is a deal that can get done. But it is not going to be—it cannot be done if every side wants 100 percent. And part of what voters were looking for is some compromise up here. That's what folks want. They understand that they're not going to get 100 percent of what they want. And for some reason, that message has not yet taken up on Capitol Hill.And when you think about what we've gone through over the last couple of months—a devastating hurricane and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory—the country deserves folks to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good and not tangle themselves up in a whole bunch of ideological positions that don't make much sense.So I remain not only open to conversations, but I remain eager to get something done. I'd like to get it done before Christmas. There's been a lot of posturing up on Capitol Hill and instead of just going ahead and getting stuff done. And we've been wasting a lot of time. It is the right thing to do. I'm prepared to get it done. But they're going to have to go ahead and make some adjustments.And I'll just give you one other example. The Speaker now is proposing what he calls plan B. So he says, well, this would raise taxes only on folks making a million dollars or more. What that means is an average of a $50,000 tax break for every millionaire out there, at the same time as we're not providing unemployment insurance for 2 million people who are still out there looking for work. It actually means a tax increase for millions of working families across the country at the same time as folks like me would be getting a tax break. That violates the core principles that were debated during the course of this election and that the American people determined was the wrong way to go.And so my hope is, is that the Speaker and his caucus, in conjunction with the other legislative leaders up there, can find a way to make sure that middle class families don't see their taxes go up on January 1; that we make sure that those things that middle class families count on like tax credits for college or making sure that they're getting some help when it comes to raising their kids through things like the child tax credit, that that gets done; and that we have a balanced package for deficit reduction, which is exactly what I've put forward.", "label": "Dodging"}

But there's been some fantastic books written that just came out—whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy's book that just came out recently, and so many other books. I mean, a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they've done to this country is a disgrace. They've hurt this country very badly. And no other President should have to go through what I've gone through.The President—the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There's a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption. I just told you about Senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is, I didn't do it. You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden, and there was with these Senators. And they threatened. They said: You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes. That's—that's the real deal. So we have an honest group of people that have been maligned. And you know, it's—a lot of people say I'll do even better. I'm very happy.

{"sentence": " Will Turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the S-400 purchases? [SEP] Okay so Turkey is an interesting case—because there's another one Jim that I get along with very well and he's a tough cookie okay? Right? President Erdogan. He's tough but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing but I think it's a really good thing. Because frankly he wanted to wipe out—he has a big problem with the Kurds as everyone knows. And he had a 65000-man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the Kurds who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.And I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are I guess natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had—they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with and I said You can't do that. You can't do it. And he didn't do it.So I have a relationship. But let me tell you—so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy—even though he's a member of NATO and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the President. He—and he's got a big army and he's—you know they're fighters. Turkey is—big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed and neither do I—in Syria. But—and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned folks to President Putin. I said Please take it easy with Idlib. Because you know they've been encircling that.I think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know getting terrorists is okay but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.So anyway—so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey—and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no no no. Couldn't buy it. Now he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it.So he goes out he goes to Russia and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good but he made a deal. He paid them money a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said Listen we don't want you to use that system because it's not the NATO system et cetera et cetera—you know all the reasons: We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor we'll sell you the Patriot. He said It's too late. I already bought it. There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.In the meantime he bought over a hundred F-35s the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money up front to Lockheed our company our jobs everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the S-400 system Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.But honestly I'm all for our country but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it you can't buy it. You know it's the old secret when you can't have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were—they said—first they said: We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years. Then they said We'll get it to you immediately. But he said: I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system—similar system—from Russia. The problem is he already bought the planes. And the planes aren't compatible from our standpoint. Not from the standpoint of compatibility but from our standpoint national security wise.So it's a mess. It's a mess. And honestly it's not really Erdogan's fault.

Few of the models have been accurate.But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people.

{"sentence": " What do you see as the benefits of the project? [SEP] Well, I don't think I've minimized the benefits, I think I've described the benefits. If—at issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada. That oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf. Once that oil gets to the Gulf, it is then entering into the world market, and it would be sold all around the world.So there's no—I won't say no—there is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices, what the average American consumer cares about, by having this pipeline come through. And sometimes, the way this gets sold is, let's get this oil, and it's going to come here. And the implication is, is that's going to oil—lower gas prices here in the United States. It's not. There's a global oil market. It's very good for Canadian oil companies, and it's good for the Canadian oil industry, but it's not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers. It's not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.Now, the construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs. Those are temporary jobs until the construction actually happens. There's probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf. Those aren't completely insignificant; if—it's just like any other project. But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country, something that Congress could authorize, we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs or a million jobs. So if that's the argument, there are a lot of more direct ways to create well-paying American construction jobs.And then, with respect to the costs, all I've said is that I want to make sure that if in fact this project goes forward, that it's not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people, some of them long term, but significant costs nonetheless. If we've got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that.And as we're now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we're having to consider, how do we increase preparedness in how we structure infrastructure and housing and so forth along the Jersey Shore? That's an example of the kind of costs that are imposed, and you can put a dollar figure on it. So, in terms of process, you've got a Nebraska judge that's still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate. Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision.But I've just tried to give this perspective, because I think that there's been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula and—to what ails the U.S. economy, and it's hard to see on paper where exactly they're getting that information from.In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it won't have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks. When gas prices are lower, maybe they're more—less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices. But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market.

I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where—to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country—or 150,000 forces and invade that country—invade that country without any rationale other than—if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland.You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think.

If we stand—if we had stood still, what signal would that send to about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the—let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.But—and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, that has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe—well beyond Europe.I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe—well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri-La capture that.And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point.

And I mean that.Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.It's wrong for—that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are—they're gay.

And actually, one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point very eloquently yesterday.And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against.Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue.

First of all, Christi, I hardly think that you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here. I think that people--the American people rightly remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens. And it's a mark of the excellence of our intelligence teams and our military teams, a political process that worked. And I think for us to use that time for some reflection to give thanks to those who participated is entirely appropriate, and that's what's been taking place.As far as my personal role and what other folks would do, I'd just recommend that everybody take a look at people's previous statements in terms of whether they thought it was appropriate to go into Pakistan and take out bin Laden. I assume that people meant what they said when they said it. That's been at least my practice. I said that I'd go after bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him, and I did.If there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, then I'd go ahead and let them explain it. President Obama has been standing at the very forefront in the fight against terrorism, and I hold him in very high regard for that.Now, although bin Laden has been killed, terrorism has not been rooted out, and I think continued efforts will be needed in cooperation with the United States. We also would like to continue all our efforts against terrorism. I think the forms of terrorism are being very diverse, amongst them, cyberterrorism, for example. This--[inaudible]--between Japan and the United States not just in the cyber--in the space and ocean, but we also decided to cooperate in cybersecurity as well. So, inclusive of all these, Japan and the United States shall work together to root out terrorism of all sorts.Let me call on Takatsuka-san of Mainichi Shimbun.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Can you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work? [SEP] Well, I'll go first, because of your question—I appreciate your question. And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our Nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in. And it's because the African American community, the Black community has had the lowest—the best employment numbers that we've ever had—both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it.But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just 6 months ago.And yes, the—I'm very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans—they had the best numbers they've ever had, by far—both employment and unemployment, depending on definition.Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that too? Okay. Yes, so what I—to clarify, I said that the first prioritization is the high-risk people and frontline health care workers.But just to reiterate, what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution for vaccination, and there's over 14,000 Federally ualified Health Centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So that's a focus.And I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high—there's a higher morbidity with—in certain ethnic groups.And last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous—an egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine, because there is no shortcut here. Everything is safe. Everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt is a particularly, you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risk.And so I implore everyone who is in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine. . I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely November 3. Once they heard that, the Democrats started—just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with a vaccine, it was totally made up. It's all disinformation.Just like they put an ad in about football. Just like they put—with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back. And I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous that Big Ten and now, hopefully, Pac-10 [Pac-12]* goes back.And I say that, just like—even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made-up story. It was a made-up story by a third-rate magazine, where the head guy—I guess, the head person—I have no idea who he is; I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton. So they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too.This story is very simple: They started knocking the vaccine as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now, it may or may not, but it will be within a matter of weeks. It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go and it's ready to—for massive distribution to everybody—with a focus, again, on seniors.And I will say, also, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are doing, at my suggestion—because they have had a difficult problem there—we are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.But we—when you look at what we've done on testing, in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon, in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests.Now what that does do is, it shows up more cases. If we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test; they don't have cases. And then they say, Oh, the United States—well—but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people.

{"sentence": "Do you see any irony in pushing them to increase oil production at the same time that you're going to COP26 to urge people to lower emissions? [SEP] Well, on the surface, it seems like an irony, but the truth of the matter is—you've all known; everyone knows—that the idea we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight and not have—from this moment on, not use oil or not use gas or not use hydrogen is just not rational.Certain things we can wipe out and we don't have to do. We should be moving immediately to get rid of—as they've adopted here my proposal—to end methane, to deal with a whole range of things.But it does, on the surface, seem inconsistent, but it's not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we'd be in a position—or even next year—that we're not going to use any more oil or gas; that we're not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We're going to be making significant changes.And it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy: to wind and solar and other means of energy.But the idea that we're just going to end and somehow—but it does, on the surface, I admit to you. We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, and I'm saying, Why are you guys cutting off oil and raising the price just to make it look harder for us? But it's a legitimate question.I think, though, that if anybody thinks about it, no one ever thought that tomorrow—for example, it's going to take us between now and 2030 to have half the vehicles in America electric vehicles.

If they want us at the table, we're more than willing to come, but there must be a verifiable suspension of this weapons program that is causing such grave concern.We'll continue to work with other nations.

{"sentence": "How long should Americans expect to face higher prices when they're at the grocery store or when they're at the gas pump? Is this something that they're going to see into the summer, into next fall? [SEP] Well, look, as you know, Ken, the inflation has everything to do with the supply chain. And I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to make progress on speeding up the access to materials. For example, one third of the cost—of the increase in cost of living is the cost of automobiles.The reason automobiles have skyrocketed in price is because of the lack of computer chips. So we have the capacity, and we're going to do everything in our power to do it to become self-reliant on the computer chips that we need in order to be able to produce more automobiles. That's underway.We've already passed, within the context of another bill, money for that in the—in the House of Representatives. It's before the House of Representatives now. But I think there's a way we can move to—if we can move to get, for example, that one thing done, it can make a big difference in terms of the cost of—the total cost of living.Now, with regard to the whole issue of energy prices, that gets a little more complicated. But you saw what happened when I was able to convince everyone from—including China, India—a number of other countries—to agree with us to go into their version of the—of their petroleum reserve to release more into the market so that—that brought down the price about 12, 15 cents a gallon in some places, some places more.There's going to be a reckoning along the line here as to whether or not we're going to continue to see oil prices continue to go up in ways that are going up now, relative to what is going to—what impact that's going to have on the producers.And so it's going to be hard. I think that's the place where most middle class people, working class people get hit the most. They pull up to a pump, and all of a sudden, instead of paying $2.40 a gallon, they're paying $5 a gallon. And that's going to be really difficult.But—so we're going to continue to work on trying to increase oil supplies that are available. And I think there's ways in which we can be of some value added in terms of the price of gas—natural gas and the like—to take the burden off of European countries that are now totally dependent on Russia. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be very hard.But I think that we have to deal with—for example, like I said, you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid. Well, one of the reasons for that is, you don't have that many folks out there that are ones that are—we've got the Big Four controlling it all.And so you're going to see, more and more, we're going to move on this competition piece to allow more and more smaller operations to come in and be able to engage in providing—buying and providing the access to much cheaper meat than exists now. But it's going to be a haul.Now, and as you—I assume the reason you said if I can't get Build Back Better is, it relates to what those 17 Nobel laureate economists said: that if in fact we could pass it, it would actually lower the impact on inflation, reduce inflation over time, et cetera.So there's a lot we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but I think we can get it done. But it's going to be painful for a lot of people in the meantime. That's why the single best way—the single best way—to take the burden off middle class and working class folks is to pass the Build Back Better piece that are things that they're paying a lot of money for it now.If you get to trade off higher gas as—you're putting up with a higher price of hamburgers and gas, versus whether or not you're going to have to—you're going to be able to pay for education and/or childcare and the like, I think most people would make the trade.

{"sentence": "President Musharraf's party has been routed in parliamentary elections there, and it appears that he's lost the support of his people. Do you see this as the beginning of the end for him? [SEP] Do you believe Americans see it in their interest to help Africa? Yes. I might try to help you out on the last question. America is wealthy enough to do both.There was a victory for the people of Pakistan, and that is, there were elections held that have been judged as being fair. And the people have spoken. I view that as a significant victory. I view it as a part of the victory in the war on terror. After all, ideologues can't stand—like these guys we're dealing with—can't stand free societies. That's why they try to kill innocent people. That's why they tried to intimidate people during the election process.And so I'm—I appreciate the fact that President Musharraf has done exactly that which he said he was going to do. He said he'd hold elections; he said he would get rid of his emergency law. And so it's now time for the newly elected folks to show up and form their Government. And the question then is, will they be friends of the United States? And I certainly hope so.We view Pakistan as an important ally. We've got common interests. We've got interests in dealing with radicals who killed Benazir Bhutto. We've got interests in helping make sure there's no safe haven from which people can plot and plan attacks against the United States of America and Pakistan. And so that's my take on the elections. Thank you, and whether American interests coincides with African interests, I would say, yes. Yes. One should ask what the whole idea of the United States is about. The U.S. is a melting pot of all the races and nationalities of the world. Your country has a large content of African Americans, so that I would expect that constituency of Africa—and incidentally, the African Union has itemized the people of African descent as the sixth region of Africa. And so we look on the African Americans as our kith and kin, and they constitute a sizeable constituency in the United States. It should be in their interest to support any help the United States can extend to Africa. That's one.Two, we are all moving into a global village, and problems overspill easily, especially with the free movements of people and trade, so that if the United States should lock itself into isolationism and think they are safer there, then I would say, perhaps they don't know what is coming, because global village is a reality. Migration cannot be stopped, and if you do not help, then the vibrant youth of Africa, driven by the technological age forces—they watch television, the Internet, and so forth—they want to move and see what's happening around the world. They will come to you, and if you do not help us to prepare this youth, then whatever youth would land on your shores would come with all the roughness, the hurry, and that would be your headache.So I believe it's enlightenment for the United States Government to want to support them here. And then we talk terrorism, which has no bounds. As evidence, when the 9/11 happened in your country, it wasn't only Americans who became victims; some Ghanaians died in that event, and shows we have common interests somewhere. So these and other factors should account for why the United States, perhaps industrially and otherwise the most advanced country in the world, should be concerned about the plight of other peoples.

Okay?And with respect to the issue of mandate, I've got one mandate. I've got a mandate to help middle class families and families that are working hard to try to get into the middle class. That's my mandate. That's what the American people said. They said: Work really hard to help us. Don't worry about the politics of it, don't worry about the party interests, don't worry about the special interests. Just work really hard to see if you can help us get ahead, because we're working really hard out here and we're still struggling, a lot of us.

And you meet young people who are doing incredible work in disadvantaged communities because they believe in the American ideal and it should available for everybody. And you meet farmers who are helping each other during times of drought, and you meet businesses that kept their doors open during the recession, even though the owner didn't have to take a salary.And when you talk to these folks, you say to yourself, man, they deserve a better government than they've been getting.

And in part because of this conference, Ukraine took that step, announced that it would complete this step over the next couple of years.So all the commitments that we talked about are ones that we've already booked, even before the communique and the work plan gets put into place.

It's nothing less—it's a significant issue, it's a very important issue.And also, yesterday there was a new framework of our economic cooperation was laid out, according to which $800 million were made—a commitment were made, those will be spent through the Afghan budget. But most importantly is the flexibility that has been shown in the area of security cooperation. And this flexibility is going to ensure and provide confidence to our security forces and our people and also is going to send a very strong message to the region that this cooperation is not short term, but is enduring and long term. . Our strategic partnership is based on a very simple principle. We want the Afghan people, through their security forces directed by their President and Commander in Chief, to be able to provide for their own security. And our goal is to make sure that we are a strong partner in helping to build and sustain effective Afghan security forces.So, from the start, when I first came into office, we put additional U.S. troops, coalition troops, and resources into Afghanistan to shift momentum at a time when the Taliban and the enemies of peace and stability inside of Afghanistan, I think, were moving and had momentum.We broke that momentum, elections took place, and the Afghan National Security Forces began to build up and get trained and become more and more effective. And because of a successful election and a national unity Government and the leadership of President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah, we are now in a position where the Afghan security forces are not only more effective, but they're also better directed by the civilian Government.We've been able to draw down and remove ourselves from a combat role, as doctor—as President Ghani indicated, without collapse, as was predicted. And Afghan soldiers have fought, and they've fought well. And obviously, there are still improvements to be made, but they're making significant progress.So the strategic partnership involves us continuing to help support Afghan security forces. That means financially. The international community is going to have to continue to provide assistance to the Afghan Government, which is carrying a significant security load not only for itself, but for the region and, in some ways, the world. And we've made a commitment to do that.We're going to continue to provide the kind of security cooperation and support that is required—training, assisting, advising, helping on logistics, helping on developing enabler capacity—all the things that go into a modern military, a professional military, a professional police force that can provide security on Afghan soil by Afghans.And the cooperation and the strategic partnership involves building up the prosperity and opportunities for the Afghan people through the economic development that was mentioned by the President.So we intend to be working with the Afghan Government and the Afghan people for a long time. And in many ways, our troop presence, our military assistance is just one component of what is a much larger process. And the more successful we are in building Afghan capacity and strengthening the Afghan economy, the more the strategic partnership that we have will be like the partnership that we have with many countries around the world. And it will be based on mutual interest and scientific and educational exchanges and business opportunities and commerce and trade. And that, I think, is the goal that we're all looking for.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].", "label": "Explicit"}

I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does. And we have the greatest strength in the world—especially now. We were being depleted under the last administration. We had planes that were old and tired and didn't fly, in some cases. They were getting used parts. This is the United States; it doesn't happen. We make the greatest planes in the world and missiles in the world.And we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military. It's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine. They never had it so good, because I got, in Congress, $700 billion this year; $716 billion last year. That's far more than they ever anticipated.I viewed it two ways. Number one, military—because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs. But number two is jobs. We make everything here. So it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world. And Russia respects that. They respect that. So I am with the President. I feel that he's right.

{"sentence": "Specific steps to reduce energy dependence on Russia [SEP] Let me respond. First of all, we are looking at opportunities to make up for lost gas—LNG—from Russia. We're underway of trying to see what we can do to do that and dealing with our friends around the world, as well. We think we could make up a significant portion of it that would be lost.But you know, what everybody forgets here is, Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil. Russia relies—a significant part of Russia's budget—it's the only thing they really have to export. And if in fact it's cut off, then they're going to be hurt very badly as well. And it's of consequence to them as well. This is not just a one-way street.And so we are looking at what we could do to help compensate for loss of—immediate loss of gas in Europe if it occurs. And that's what we've been working on for some time now. I can confirm that we work closely with the United States of America, and Joe Biden and I are working closely together as well.We are prepared for all kinds of situation. And that's part of what we do when we say we prepare sanctions. That means we need to be able to react at any time, and this is happening.With regard to the use of LNG, I can say that the biggest volume of LNG used across the world is the gas, and that is part of the debate.Concerning a long-term perspective, I already outlined what this is about. We will modernize our economy. And where gas is being used, we will switch to hydrogen. This will be a process that will happen faster than many might imagine today, and that will create a bright future for all of us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": " Is your administration's open quarreling with Trump and his team on this issue tarnishing the smooth transition of power that you have promised? [SEP] Well, first of all, with respect to the transition, I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful as I promised. And that will continue. And it's just been a few days since I last talked to the President-elect about a whole range of transition issues. That cooperation is going to continue.There hasn't been a lot of squabbling. What we've simply said is the facts, which are that, based on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and that, as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference through cyber attacks in the future.That should be a bipartisan issue; that shouldn't be a partisan issue. And my hope is that the President-elect is going to similarly be concerned with making sure that we don't have potential foreign influence in our election process. I don't think any American wants that. And that shouldn't be a source of an argument.I think that part of the challenge is that it gets caught up in the carryover from election season. And I think it is very important for us to distinguish between the politics of the election and the need for us, as a country, both from a national security perspective, but also in terms of the integrity of our election system and our democracy, to make sure that we don't create a political football here.Now, with respect to how this thing unfolded last year, let's just go through the facts pretty quickly. At the beginning of the summer, we're alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it, investigate it thoroughly, to brief the potential victims of this hacking, to brief on a bipartisan basis the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the relevant intelligence committees. And once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact, had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russia had hacked into the DNC.And at that time, we did not attribute motives or any interpretations of why they had done so. We didn't discuss what the effects of it might be. We simply let people know—the public know, just as we had let Members of Congress know—that this had happened. And as a consequence, all of you wrote a lot of stories about both what had happened, and then you interpreted why that might have happened and what effect it was going to have on the election outcomes. We did not. And the reason we did not was because in this hyperpartisan atmosphere, at a time when my primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens, I wanted to make sure that everybody understood we were playing this thing straight, that we weren't trying to advantage one side or another, but what we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place, and so if you started seeing effects on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account.And that's exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place; at a time, by the way, when the President-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.And finally, I think it's worth pointing out that the information was already out. It was in the hands of WikiLeaks, so that was going to come out no matter what. What I was concerned about, in particular, was making sure that that wasn't compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself.And so in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn't. And in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred.So when I look back in terms of how we handled it, I think we handled it the way it should have been handled. We allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence. We briefed all relevant parties involved in terms of what was taking place. When we had a consensus around what had happened, we announced it, not through the White House, not through me, but rather through the intelligence communities that had actually carried out these investigations. And then, we allowed you and the American public to make an assessment as to how to weigh that going into the election.And the truth is, is that there was nobody here who didn't have some sense of what kind of effect it might have. I'm finding it a little curious that everybody is suddenly acting surprised that this looked like it was disadvantaging Hillary Clinton, because you guys wrote about it every day. [] Every single leak. About every little juicy tidbit of political gossip, including John Podesta's risotto recipe. [] This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage.So I do think it's worth us reflecting how it is that a Presidential election of such importance, of such moment, with so many big issues at stake, and such a contrast between the candidates, came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. What is it about our political system that made us vulnerable to these kinds of potential manipulations, which, as I've said publicly before, were not particularly sophisticated. This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic Party e-mails that contained pretty routine stuff, some of it embarrassing or uncomfortable, because I suspect that if any of us got our e-mails hacked into, there might be some things that we wouldn't want suddenly appearing on the front page of a newspaper or a telecast, even if there wasn't anything particularly illegal or controversial about it. And then, it just took off.And that concerns me. And it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is, is that everybody had the information. It was out there. And we handled it the way we should have.Now, moving forward, I think there are a couple of issues that this raises. Number one is just the constant challenge that we are going to have with cybersecurity throughout our economy and throughout our society. We are a digitalized culture, and there is hacking going on every single day. There's not a company, there's not a major organization, there's not a financial institution, there's not a branch of our Government where somebody is not going to be phishing for something or trying to penetrate or put in a virus or malware. And this is why for the last 8 years, I've been obsessed with how do we continually upgrade our cybersecurity systems.And this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cyber issues being used in ways that can affect our infrastructure, affect the stability of our financial systems, and affect the integrity of our institutions, like our election process.I just received a couple weeks back—it wasn't widely reported on—a report from our cybersecurity Commission that outlines a whole range of strategies to do a better job on this. But it's difficult, because it's not all housed—the target of cyber attacks is not one entity, but it's widely dispersed, and a lot of it is private, like the DNC. It's not a branch of government. We can't tell people what to do. What we can do is inform them, get best practices.What we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other countries against these kinds of attacks. And we've done that in the past. So just as I told Russia to stop it and indicated there will be consequences when they do it, the Chinese have, in the past, engaged in cyber attacks directed at our companies to steal trade secrets and proprietary technology. And I had to have the same conversation with Prime Minister—or with President Xi, and what we've seen is some evidence that they have reduced, but not completely eliminated, these activities, partly because they can use cutouts.One of the problems with the Internet and cyber issues is that there's not always a return address, and by the time you catch up to it, attributing what happened to a particular Government can be difficult, not always provable in court even though our intelligence communities can make an assessment.What we've also tried to do is to start creating some international norms about this to prevent some sort of cyber arms race, because we obviously have offensive capabilities as well as defensive capabilities. And my approach is not a situation in which everybody is worse off because folks are constantly attacking each other back and forth, but putting some guardrails around the behavior of nation-states, including our adversaries, just so that they understand that whatever they do to us we can potentially do to them.We do have some special challenges, because oftentimes, our economy is more digitalized, it is more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than some of these other countries. And we have a more open society and engage in less control and censorship over what happens over the Internet, which is also part of what makes us special.Last point—and the reason I'm going on here is because I know that you guys have a lot of questions about this, and I haven't addressed all of you directly about it—with respect to response, my principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnished, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that somehow tampering had taken place with the actual process of voting. And we accomplished that.That does not mean that we are not going to respond. It simply meant that we had a set of priorities leading up to the election that were of the utmost importance. Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you.But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. And I know that there have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians. But keep in mind that we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians. The relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years. And so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us, is something that's worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that's exactly what we've done.So at a point in time where we've taken certain actions that we can divulge publicly, we will do so. There are times where the message will go—will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized. And I should point out, by the way, part of why the Russians have been effective on this is because they don't go around announcing what they're doing. It's not like Putin is going around the world publicly saying, look what we did, wasn't that clever? He denies it. So the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective, I think, doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.Okay?", "label": "Dodging"}

I would have no problem.With respect to China basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation—which I ended a while back—and we're going to continue the negotiation. We agreed that I would not be putting tariffs on the $325 billion that I would have the ability to put on if I wanted; that—where you know we're fairly advanced depending on where you want to look at and where you want to start. Pretty advanced.We discussed—we did discuss numerous other things. We mentioned Huawei. I said: We'll have to save that until the very end. We'll have to see.One of the things I will allow however is—a lot of people are surprised—we send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that's okay that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies John that make product. And that's very complex by the way. Highly scientific.And in some cases we're the ones that do it and we're the only ones that do it. We're the only ones with the technology. What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible actually.

So I did do that. We talked about education and students. Somebody was saying it was harder for a Chinese students to come in. And that's something that if it were—if somebody viewed it that way I don't. We want to have Chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities.

{"sentence": "Have you been negotiating with Congress? [SEP] I am always open to negotiations. What is also true is they need to do something. I'm not--look, the--Bill, I think it is very clear that if Members of Congress come in and say, All right, we want to build infrastructure, here's the way we think we can do it; we want to put construction workers back to work, we've got some ideas, I am ready, eager to work with them. They say, We've got this great idea for putting teachers back in the classroom; it's a little different than what you've proposed in the jobs bill. I'm ready, eager to work with them. But that's not what we're hearing right now. I mean, what we're hearing is that their big ideas, the ones that make sense, are ones we're already doing.They've given me a list of, well, here's the Republican job creation ideas: Let's pass free trade agreements. It's great that we're passing these free trade agreements. We put them forward; I expect bipartisan support. I think it's going to be good for the American economy. But it's not going to meet the challenge of 9-percent unemployment or an economy that is currently weakening. It's not enough.Patent reform, very important for our long-term competitiveness. There's nobody out there who actually thinks that that's going to immediately fill the needs of people who are out of work or strengthen the economy right now.So what I've tried to do is say, here are the best ideas I've heard. Not just from partisans, but from independent economists. These are the ideas most likely to create jobs now and strengthen the economy right now. And that's what the American people are looking for. And the response from Republicans has been, no, although they haven't given a good reason why they're opposed to putting construction workers back on the job or teachers back in the classroom.If you ask them, well, okay, if you're not for that, what are you for? Trade has already been done; patent reform has been done. What else? The answer we're getting right now is, well, we're going to roll back all these Obama regulations. So their big economic plan to put people back to work right now is to roll back financial protections and allow banks to charge hidden fees on credit cards again or weaken consumer watchdogs. Or alternatively, they've said we'll roll back regulations that make sure we've got clean air and clean water, eliminate the EPA. Does anybody really think that that is going to create jobs right now and meet the challenges of a global economy that are--that is weakening with all these forces coming into play?I mean, here is a good question, here's a little homework assignment for folks: Go ask the Republicans what their jobs plan is, if they're opposed to the American Jobs Act, and have it scored, have it assessed by the same independent economists that have assessed our jobs plan. These independent economists say that we could grow the economy as much as 2 percent and as many as 1.9 million workers would be back on the job. I think it would be interesting to have them do a similar assessment--same people. Some of these folks, by the way, traditionally have worked for Republicans, not just Democrats. Have those economists evaluate what, over the next 2 years, the Republican jobs plan would do. I'll be interested in the answer. I think everybody here--I see some smirks in the audience because you know that it's not going to be real robust.And so, Bill, the question, then, is, will Congress do something? If Congress does something, then I can't run against a do-nothing Congress. If Congress does nothing, then it's not a matter of me running against them; I think the American people will run them out of town because they are frustrated, and they know we need to do something big and something bold.Now, the American people are also concerned about making sure that we have a Government that lives within its means, which is why I put forward a plan that would also reduce our deficit and our debt in a more aggressive way than what the special committee has been charged with.Folks want to talk about corporate tax reform. I've already said I'm happy to engage with them on corporate tax reform. I'm happy to engage with them, working to see what we can do to streamline and simplify our Tax Code, eliminate all the loopholes, eliminate these special interest carve-outs and potentially lower rates in the process while raising more revenue.I am happy to negotiate with them on a whole host of issues, but right now we've got an emergency. And the American people are living that emergency out every single day, and they have been for a long time. They are working really hard. And if they're not on the job, then they're working really hard to find a job. And they're losing their homes, and their kids are having to drop out of school because they can't afford student loans. And they're putting off visiting a doctor because when they lost their job they lost their health insurance. They are struggling.And as a consequence, by the way, all of us are struggling, even those who are well off. The irony is the same folks that the Republicans claim to be protecting, the well off--the millionaires and the billionaires--they'd be doing better, they'd be making more money if ordinary Americans had some money in their pockets and were out there feeling more confident about the economy.

We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours—needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests.

{"sentence": "Are America's banks in trouble? [SEP] First, let me talk about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A lot of people in the country probably don't understand how important they are to the mortgage markets. And it's really important for people to have confidence in the mortgage markets and that there be stability in the mortgage markets. And that's why Secretary Paulson announced the plan this weekend, which says that he needs authorities from the Congress to come up with a line of credit for these institutions, if needed, and that he ought to have the authority to invest capital, if needed.And so the purpose was to send a clear signal that, one, we understand how important these institutions are to the mortgage markets, and two, to kind of calm nerves. The truth of the matter is, by laying this out, it is—makes it less likely we'll need to use this kind of authority to begin with, which, by the way, is temporary authority.As you—talked about banks. Now, if you're a commercial bank in America and your deposit—and you have a deposit in a commercial bank in America, your deposit is insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. And so therefore, when you hear nervousness about your bank, you know, people start talking about how nervous they are about your bank's condition, the depositor must understand that the Federal Government, through the FDIC, stands behind the deposit up to $100,000. And therefore—which leads me to say that if you're a depositor, you're in—you're protected by the Federal Government.I happened to have witnessed a bank run in Midland, Texas, one time. I'll never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying, Your deposits are good. We got you insured. You don't have to worry about it if you got less than $100,000 in the bank. The problem was, people didn't hear. And there's a—became a nervousness. My hope is, is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our Government.So these are two different instances, mortgage markets on the one hand, banking on the other.", "label": "General"}

[SEP] As long as it takes so Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine. This is a critical, critical position for the world. Here we are. Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.", "label": "Deflection"}

[SEP] Well, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It—called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates—what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors.

You have to be able to walk away. If you're not going to be able to walk away—we didn't walk away from the horrible Iran deal that was signed. And if you look at what's happened since I signed that deal, Iran—and in all fairness, I say it with great respect for the people of Iran—but Iran is acting a lot differently. They're no longer looking so much to the Mediterranean. They're no longer looking so much to what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Yemen and lots of other places. They're a much different country over the last 3 months.And again, I say that with hope that maybe something can happen. But when you mention sanctions, we're putting sanctions on Iran, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, including, frankly, . That would have been the next phase, if we did it or find it necessary to do.But nuclear to me is always first. And we're going to be fine, with respect to Iran. But we also, Saagar, got something out of it that's very important. A lot of the people that write about this, some of whom I have great respect for, but they haven't picked it up: Iran is not the same country that it was a few months ago. They're a much, much different group of leaders. And I hope at some point they'll come to us and we'll sit down and we'll make a deal that's good for them and good for us and good for everybody.

I said we're getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous, endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there. In the Middle East, we should have never been. But we're getting out rapidly, out of—you know, over the course of 3 years. And getting out—it's very sticky getting out. And some people agree, and many people don't agree, but I think most people very much agree.We're doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan. We're getting out. We're down to a much smaller number of people left there. And you know, I greet men and women coming home, and coming home after they've been hit. I've also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in.And we've been there 19 years, and we're basically policemen. We're acting as police, as opposed to soldiers. And they're going to have to police their own states, and they've been doing that for thousands of years. But it's time, after 19 years, that our soldiers come home.They've done an incredible job, but you know, they don't—they're not allowed to fight to win. And maybe they shouldn't be, because a lot of the people—it's not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq—again, we're down in Afghanistan; very low numbers. And that'll be taking place.And I let them know, Do anything, and you'll be hit like you've never hit—be hit—been hit before. So we're doing very well. Syria, the same thing.

We don't want to see that; we don't want to ever use it. We've rebuilt our military: new missiles and new rockets and new tanks and new everything.

{"sentence": " Are you close to having suspects in custody? [SEP] I will leave it at that. But this remains a top priority for us. Anybody who attacks Americans, anybody who kills, tragically, four Americans who were serving us in a very dangerous place, we're going to do everything we can to get those who carried out those attacks.With respect to health care, I didn't simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but—and who—many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations, if they've got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this.Now, what's true, Ed, is, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the law—it has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether they're already providing health insurance or not—it looks like there may be some better ways to do this; let's make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do.But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to, quote, unquote, Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken.You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist.Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care: mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you—he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old—thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, working with the California program, I was able to get health care, and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting.Now, what happens on October 1, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesn't have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a web site or call up a call center and sign up for affordable, quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1, into March, there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care.Now, I think the really interesting question is, why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority? The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned: kids staying on their parent's plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance.That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class.

{"sentence": " President Bush's stance on drawing a line with Iran in regards to their nuclear ambitions. [SEP] Ed [Edwin Chen, Bloomberg News], I just strongly disagree with your premise that the six-party talks has encouraged Iran to develop nuclear weapons. I don't know why you have even come to that conclusion because the facts are, the six-party talks is the only way to send a message to the North Koreans that the world isn't going to tolerate them having a weapon.I mean, in other words, they are—we'll see what they disclose, but we, hopefully, are in the process of disabling and dismantling their plutonium manufacturing. We're, hopefully, in the process of getting them to disclose what they have manufactured and eventually turning it over. We're, hopefully, in the process of disclosing their proliferation activities, and it's a six-party process. I mean, the only way, in my judgment, to diplomatically solve these kinds of problems with nations like Iran and North Korea, nontransparent nations, is through a multilateral process where there's more than one nation sending the same message to the leaders of these respective countries.And so I disagree with your premise. As a matter of fact, the Iranians must understand that when we come together and speak with one voice, we're serious. That's why the Prime Minister's statement was so powerful, and that's the lesson that the North Koreans are hearing. And so it's— I said the other day that, you know, one of the things that I will leave behind is a multilateralism to deal with tyrants, so problems can be solved diplomatically.And the difficulty, of course, is that sometimes economics and money trumps national security interests. So you go around asking nations—by the way, it's not a problem for Great Britain—so you say to your partners, don't sell goods; you know, let's send a focused message, all aiming to create the conditions so that somebody rational shows up. In other words, people, hopefully, are sick of isolation in their respective countries, and they show up and say, we're tired of this; there's a better way forward.And in order for that to be effective, Ed, there has to be more than one voice. So if I were the North Koreans and I were looking at Iran, or the Iranians looking at North Korea, I'd say, uh-oh, there are coalitions coming together that are bound tightly, more tightly than ever, in order to send us a focused message.And you know, let me just say one thing about the Iranian demand for civilian nuclear power: It's a justifiable demand. You just heard the Prime Minister talk about the spread of civilian nuclear power, which I support—starting in my own country, by the way. We need to be building civilian nuclear power plants.And so when the Iranians say we have a sovereign right to have one, the answer is, you bet. You have a sovereign right; absolutely. But you don't have the trust of those of us who have watched you carefully when it comes to enriching uranium because you have declared that you want to destroy democracies in the neighborhood, for example. Therefore—and this is the Russian proposal, by the way—therefore, we'll provide fuel for you, and we'll collect the fuel after you've used it so you can have your nuclear—civilian nuclear power, which undermines what the Iranians are saying, and that is, we must enrich in order to have civilian nuclear power. You don't need to enrich to have civilian nuclear power. The Russian proposal is what we support. This proposal wouldn't have happened had there not been a multilateral process.And so what these nations need to see is, we're serious about solving these problems. And the United States spends a lot of time working with our partners to get them solved.Thank you very much. Thank you all very much.", "label": "Explicit"}

It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard.

Of course, I told Mr. President about all the aspects connected with the permanent presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland. But, first and foremost, I assured Mr. President of one thing. First and foremost, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot say that, if there are permanent bases of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland, we will see a deterioration of security because that will lead to an increase in Russian activity and increased militarization of this part of Europe by Russia.I want to say it clearly, ladies and gentlemen: A very strong militarization of, for instance, Kaliningrad Oblast has taken place for more than 10 years now. It is the reality that we're living today. As far aggressive Russian behavior is concerned, as far as increased military activities concerned, including increasing of the militarization, Russia has been conducting such activities in a systematic way. And for the first time, we were able to see that in a materialized way in Georgia. In 2008, when the then-President of Poland, Professor Lech Kaczynski, took other European leaders, and they went to Tbilisi to stop Russian tanks, which were about to attack the capital of Georgia. And from that moment, that military expansion has been developing.It's another leg was the attack on Ukraine. And today we can see an illegal annexation of Crimea. Today, we are witnessing constant violation of international law in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. So these are today political and military facts of Europe, and the presence of the United States is only providing a guarantee of security and a possibility to defend.Because let me reiterate again: It is only about the guarantee of security and defense of our part of Europe that is the free world. This is the most crucial issue right now from our perspective, from the perspective of Central and Eastern European countries. And we are speaking in one voice on this one, generally.That is why we wanted to ensure the presence of the United States Armed Forces, and also, we wanted to have the presence of NATO forces in our part of Europe as well. And of course, Mr. President and his staff, his advisers, and also the Pentagon staff, have to consider all these issues, but there is a whole range of arguments which are in favor of the fact that the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in this area is absolutely justified today. That is due to the protection of the interests of the United States as well.So I'm absolutely convinced of this one, because today, unfortunately, we are seeing international law being violated. Today, we are seeing aggressive behaviors, and I am convinced that there is no more effective method of preventing a war than a decisive stance demonstrating that we are ready any moment to repel a possible attack.

And we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid.It's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people. And we should help them; we don't expect anything for that. But when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the United States, they're only taking advantage of us. And we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment. Payment. And we get along with them very well, but it's not fair.

{"sentence": "The President's stance on considering both spending cuts and tax revenues. [SEP] No, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told you—and you may be aware or you've seen it—we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.And secondly, we're in a situation where the—let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, Okay, we have to make some cuts, would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income—what was coming in the door—to determine what you could afford?And so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as—as well as—cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the—my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are—we've provided for the number of—we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America—very complicated stuff.It's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between—we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.And there's a lot of other—for example, the idea that we're—in terms of taxes—that they refuse to—for example, we—I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill—anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.And—because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty—$400 billion—or $40 billion—$400 billion—that they—they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes. What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.And like I said, we're now down to—we went from somewhere—roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table.

[SEP] Well, on the latter point, as I said before, the transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. It's bumpy. There are still feelings that are raw out there. There are people who are still thinking about how things unfolded. And I get all that. But when Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn as the 45th President of the United States, then he's got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. And I've said this before: I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office. And I haven't shared previously private conversations I've had with the President-elect. I will say that they have been cordial and, in some cases, have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to ensure that regardless of our obvious deep disagreements about policy, maybe I can transmit some thoughts about maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can't say that he will end up implementing, but the conversations themselves have been cordial as opposed to defensive in any way. And I will always make myself available to him, just as previous Presidents have made themselves available to me as issues come up.With respect to the FBI, I will tell you, I've had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents, I know Director Comey. They take their job seriously, they work really hard, they help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. And it is always a challenge for law enforcement when there's an intersection between the work that they are doing and the political system. It's one of the difficulties of democracy, generally. We have a system where we want our law enforcement investigators and our prosecutors to be free from politics, to be independent, to play it straight, but sometimes, that involves investigations that touch on politics.

We had an immediate task, which was to rescue an economy that was tipping over a cliff. And we put in place an economic plan that 95 percent of economists say substantially helped us avoid a depression.A third of those were tax cuts, by the way. A third of that economic plan was tax cuts for individuals and for small businesses. So we haven't--this notion that we waited until now to put forward a series of plans, Chip, we've--just on the small-business issue alone, we have cut taxes for small businesses eight times during the course of the last 18 months.

Three million people have jobs that wouldn't have them otherwise had we not taken these steps. The economy would be in much worse shape. But as I said before, we're not where we need to go yet, which means that if we're not there yet, what else can we do?And the proposals that we've put forward are ones that historically, again, have garnered bipartisan support: a research and development tax credit so that companies that are investing in research here in the United States, which is part of what's going to keep us growing and keep us innovative, let's make sure that companies are strongly incentivized to do that; making sure that their expensing accelerated business depreciation is happening in 2011 so that if companies are sort of sitting on the sidelines right now, not sure whether they should invest, let's give them incentive to go ahead and invest now to give that a jumpstart.On infrastructure, we've got a highway bill that traditionally is done every 6 years. And what we're saying is, let's ramp up what we're doing, let's beef it up a little bit, because we've got this infrastructure all across the country that everybody from Governors to mayors to economists to engineers of all political stripes have said is holding us back in terms of our long-term competitiveness. Let's get started now rebuilding America.And in terms of paying for some of these things, let's stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Let's stop incentivizing that. Let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the United States of America.Those are all commonsense approaches. Historically, as you know--you've been around this town for a long time--usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on infrastructure. Usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on making sure that research and development investments are made right here in the United States.

I'm worried about putting people back to work right now, because those folks are hurting and the U.S. economy is underperforming. And so everything that we're doing here in the--here at the G-20 mirrors our efforts back home. That is, how do we boost growth, how do we shrink our deficits in a way that doesn't slow the recovery right now, how do we make sure that our workers are getting the skills and the training they need to compete in a global economy? And not only does the American Jobs Act answer some of the needs for jobs now, but it will also lay the foundation for future growth through investments in infrastructure, for example.So my hope is, is that the folks back home, including those in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives, when they look at today's job numbers--which were positive, but indicate once again that the economy is growing way too slow--that they think twice before they vote no again on the only proposal out there right now that independent economists say would actually make a dent in unemployment right now.

I saw Speaker Pelosi last night at the Congressional Ball at the White House, and we have very cordial relations.

You can imagine what it's like to try to deal on an important piece of legislation, and the Democrats in the House have one opinion, and the Democrats in the Senate have another opinion. FISA is a good example.And in order for us to be able to reach accord, they've got to come with one voice, one position. And it's—nobody—like, the most disappointing thing about Washington has been the name-calling and this kind of—people go out in front of the mikes, and they just kind of unleash. And I've tried hard not to do that. I've tried to be respectful to all parties. And that's disappointing.On the other hand, I think we can get some things done. The Peruvian trade vote is one; there's an example. And the Congress needs to get their differences sorted. One of the worst ways to negotiate is to negotiate with one group. They pocket your negotiations, and then another group shows up and says, Well, you've said this to them, now give us this.And hopefully, as we come down the stretch here, that they're capable of coming forward with, Here's what we believe; here's our plan; here's what we would like you to consider, as opposed to some examples, which is passing legislation for the sake of the headline, as opposed to passing legislation to get it passed. And SCHIP is a classic example. They knew I was going to veto the bill. They knew that was going to happen. They knew the veto would be sustained. But they ate up valuable time and passed the bill anyway.And so we sit here in the White House trying to figure out why. Why would you waste time? Why wouldn't you sit down and try to seriously negotiate an agreement on a bill that they knew was going to get vetoed and sustained?Now, hopefully, in the next—however long they intend to stay here, that we're capable of working together. But if not, I'm going to stand strong for certain principles, and one of which is to make sure our troops get funded. We've got men and women in combat. We've got people risking their lives for the United States of America. And this Congress has yet to fund them, and it needs to. And it needs to fund them without telling our military how to conduct this war. Arbitrary dates for withdrawal are unacceptable, particularly given the fact that the strategy is working—it's working.And it seems like to me that this Congress ought to be congratulating our military commanders and our troops. And one way to send a congratulatory message is to give them the funds they need, and now is the time to do it.Let's see here, Mark Silva [Chicago Tribune].", "label": "Explicit"}

It is in America's interests to see succeed in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. can be a source of stability and help to underwrite international norms and codes of conduct.And so what we've done over the last 2 years is to try to develop a frank, consistent, open relationship and dialogue with , and it's yielded considerable benefits, for example, support for issues like . But what I've also said to Chinese leadership since I came into office is that when it comes to their economic practices, there are a range of things that they have done that disadvantage not just the United States, but a whole host of their trading partners and countries in the region.The most famous example is the issue of 's currency. Most economists estimate that the RMB is devalued by 20 to 25 percent. That means our exports to are that much more expensive and their imports into the United States are that much cheaper. Now, there's been slight improvement over the last year, partly because of U.S. pressure, but it hasn't been enough. And it's time for them to go ahead and move towards a market-based system for their currency.Now, we recognize they may not be able to do it overnight, but they can do it much more quickly than they've done it so far. And by the way, that would not necessarily be a bad thing for the Chinese economy, because they've been so focused on export-driven growth that they've neglected domestic consumption, building up domestic markets. It makes them much more vulnerable to shocks in the global economy. It throws the whole world economy out of balance because they're not buying as much as they could be from other countries.And this is not something that's inconsistent with where Chinese leadership say they want to go. The problem is, is that you've got a bunch of export producers in who like the system as it is and making changes are difficult for them politically. I get it. But the United States and other countries, I think understandably, feel that enough's enough.That's not the only concern we have. Intellectual property rights and protections--companies that do business in consistently report problems in terms of intellectual property not being protected. Now, that's particularly important for an advanced economy like ours, where that's one of our competitive advantages, is we've got great engineers, great entrepreneurs, we're designing extraordinary new products. And if they get no protection, and the next thing you know, 's operating as a low-cost producer and not paying any fees or revenues to folks who invented these products, that's a problem.So those are two examples, but there are a number of others. These practices aren't secret. I think everybody understands that they've been going on for quite some time. Sometimes, American companies are wary about bringing them up because they don't want to be punished in terms of their ability to do business in . But I don't have that same concern, so I bring it up.And in terms of enforcement, the other thing that we've been doing is actually trying to enforce the trade laws that are in place. We've brought a number of cases. One that the U.S. press may be familiar with are the cases involving U.S. tires, where we brought very aggressive actions against and won. And as a consequence, U.S. producers are in a better position, and that means more U.S. jobs.So I think we can benefit from trade with . And I want certainly to continue cultivating a constructive relationship with the Chinese Government, but we're going to continue to be firm in insisting that they operate by the same rules that everybody else operates under.

Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in , where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run—they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in , and the diaspora could cause some real—how can I say it?—confusion in the Western Hemisphere.And so—but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some.

{"sentence": "Shouldn't we be having a vigorous debate about what could happen in the case of a Middle East war in a way that we did not do before going into Iraq? [SEP] Well, I think there's no doubt that those who are suggesting or proposing or beating the drums of war should explain clearly to the American people what they think the costs and benefits would be.I'm not one of those people, because what I've said is, is that we have a window through which we can resolve this issue peacefully. We have put forward an international framework that is applying unprecedented pressure. The Iranians just stated that they are willing to return to the negotiating table. And we've got the opportunity, even as we maintain that pressure, to see how it plays out.I'm not going to go into the details of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But what I said publicly doesn't differ greatly from what I said privately. Israel is a sovereign nation that has to make its own decisions about how best to preserve its security. And as I said over the last several days, I am deeply mindful of the historical precedents that weigh on any Prime Minister of Israel when they think about the potential threats to Israel and the Jewish homeland.What I've also said is that because sanctions are starting to have significant effect inside of Iran--and that's not just my assessment, that's, I think, a uniform assessment--because the sanctions are going to be even tougher in the coming months, because they're now starting to affect their oil industry, their central bank, and because we're now seeing noises about them returning to the negotiating table, that it is deeply in everybody's interests, the United States, Israel, and the world's, to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful fashion.And so this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or 2 weeks, or month or 2 months, is not borne out by the facts. And the argument that we've made to the Israelis is that we have made an unprecedented commitment to their security. There is an unbreakable bond between our two countries, but one of the functions of friends is to make sure that we provide honest and unvarnished advice in terms of what is the best approach to achieve a common goal, particularly one in which we have a stake. This is not just an issue of Israeli interest, this is an issue of U.S. interests. It's also not just an issue of consequences for Israel if action is taken prematurely. There are consequences to the United States as well.And so I do think that any time we consider military action, that the American people understand there's going to be a price to pay. Sometimes, it's necessary. But we don't do it casually.When I visit Walter Reed, when I sign letters to families that haven't--whose loved ones have not come home, I am reminded that there is a cost. Sometimes, we bear that cost. But we think it through. We don't play politics with it. When we have in the past--when we haven't thought it through and it gets wrapped up in politics--we make mistakes. And typically, it's not the folks who are popping off who pay the price. It's these incredible men and women in uniform and their families who pay the price.And as a consequence, I think it's very important for us to take a careful, thoughtful, sober approach to what is a real problem.

{"sentence": "Expanding trade relationship with the United States and reaching out to Presidential candidates. [SEP] Actually, my biggest concern on trade right now is with Colombia. NAFTA exists, and NAFTA—when you analyze it in an objective way, it benefits— beneficial to America. It also happens to be beneficial to Mexico and Canada, which makes it a, you know, a very good, comprehensive agreement.It's beneficial to us because when you're able to export to your neighborhood, it helps create jobs. Jobs are created when people find outlets for their goods and services. We have found a lot of outlets for our goods and services with our—in our neighborhood. It also helps consumers when you import. In other words, the more choices consumers have, the more options they have, the more—less likely it is there will be price increases, and it's better for your consumers. This agreement's been beneficial in creating wealth in our neighborhood. Our economies have all grown.I also happen to think it's very important for our citizens. I wish people could remember what the border looked like between Texas and Mexico before NAFTA. I mean, it was poor, really poor, on both sides of the border. If you go down there today, there's prosperity on both sides of the border, and that's in our Nation's interests.I mean, one way to increase pressure on the border is to—if you do it—away with NAFTA, there's going to be a lot of Mexicans—more Mexicans out of work. It will make it harder on the border. It will make it harder to deal with. So people who say, Let's get rid of NAFTA, because of a throwaway political line, must understand this has been good for America, and it's also been good for Mexico and Canada, and that's what you want in your neighborhood.Secondly, my biggest concern is to turn our back on our friends in Colombia. The Speaker of the House made a decision, using an extraordinary procedure, to prevent a vote on a trade bill that had been negotiated in good faith between our respective countries. You heard the—President Calderon say, it's in the region's interest to trade freely and fairly. Well, this agreement we have with Colombia right now is not fair for America, it's not fair for our businesses, it's not fair for our farmers. And all I'm asking the Congress is to make it fair.And if they—if the Speaker doesn't bring—give us a date certain on the bill, she's effectively killed it. It's her responsibility, and she's going to have to explain why the voices of false populism have been strengthened, why anti-Americanism could flourish, when America turns its back on a strong leader like President Uribe and a friend for democracy like President Uribe.I'm concerned about protectionism in America. It's not in our interests to become a protectionist nation. And so I'll continue to speak out on it and assure our friends that we will work hard to explain to the people the benefits of why free and fair trade is in our Nation's interest. First of all, what we have to do—all of us who have responsibilities vis-a-vis our citizens—is to objectively study the facts. What's happened with NAFTA in our three countries? Before NAFTA, there were many businesses, Mexican businesses, that were afraid, and they alleged that it was impossible to compete with the sophisticated and modern U.S. companies. And they weren't going to survive. There were also many U.S. companies who thought it was impossible to compete in more open markets. Now, what was the result? The result has been that trade has grown, and that has led to gains for everyone involved.Contrary to what they believe—that one was going to win, the other would lose— it was a win-win situation, and NAFTA has benefited the three countries. Trade has grown in all three, jobs have grown in all three, and even wage levels have gone up in all three. Today, the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are bigger and stronger than they were 14 years ago. Income per capita for all three has also grown compared to 14 years ago. The benefits are visible, and all you need to do is to talk based on demonstrated results.To talk about taking a step backwards, in terms of free trade in the case of Mexico, would effectively provoke considerable damage on the economy. And another factor I was discussing yesterday with President Bush—that he reiterated today, and I will reiterate as well—would be a sudden loss of economic opportunities that would even lead to even greater migratory pressure in the—against—with the United States.We are doing everything we can in order to create job opportunities in Mexico for people so that Mexicans will not need to seek job opportunities outside their country. And the only way to do it is by creating jobs in Mexico, and the only way is, precisely, multiplying our possibilities of trade.In the case of the U.S. economy, if you were to take a step backwards with regard to NAFTA or free trade, you would be condemning Americans to have one of the least competitive economies in the developed world. While other parts of the world are accelerating their growth, their integration—China, Japan, India, Asia—in order to have more competitive economies and more complementary situations—and Europe is already becoming a single trade group, and they're adding more and more countries to that bloc every year—here you see protectionist voices arising. And the only thing they would achieve, if they were to prosper, would be to condemn North America as a region to complete backwardness in today's world. And that is the worst possible solution you can provide to your citizens.It is not my role to talk to the three candidates or precandidates to the Presidency. I'm very respectful of the domestic politics of this country. This is a decision that is solely in the hands of U.S. citizens. And for that reason, I must respect that process completely. It is not my role to talk to any candidates or precandidates. All I would do is speak to the person who will eventually be the President of the United States. And we will speak openly and sincerely about the future of both of our countries or, in this case, our three countries in the trilateral meetings that we hold.But Mexico will have a respectful relationship with the next President of the United States and will always seek the prosperity of our nations, knowing that through free trade, we have a clear, open, and respectful relationship among all our countries that will achieve prosperity.If we want to solve common problems, if we want to solve problems like security, problems like immigration, problems like economic growth in the United States and in Mexico, we need to understand that only to the extent that North America is more competitive as a region, only to that extent will we be able to successfully face our problems. We have been working with the current U.S. administration. We've had a very productive relationship with President Bush and his administration. And I trust that this will continue, that it will continue with any of the Presidential candidates here in the United States.Of course, it's the United States who needs to make a decision about this election. But I think that in the end, Canada really is confident that the next President will also understand the importance of NAFTA and the importance of the commercial relationship between the United States and Canada. And I must emphasize that for energy security, the commercial relationship between our two countries is even more important today than it was 20 years ago. And I think this relationship will be even more important in the future.[]——productive relationship with the current administration, and I anticipate that Canada will have a very productive relationship with the next administration, because I'm confident that when the facts are looked at, any President, just as any Prime Minister of Canada, will quickly conclude how critically important NAFTA and our North American/Canadian-American trade relations are to jobs and prosperity on both sides of our border and, in particular, the importance of energy security that is a particularly critical part of the NAFTA arrangement.Canada is the biggest and most stable supplier of energy to the United States in the world. That energy security is more important now than it was 20 years ago, when NAFTA was negotiated, and will be even more important in the future.", "label": "Implicit"}

They're seeing that, you know, more territory burned down in the United States, just since the first of the year, than—it makes up the entire landmass of the State of New Jersey. They've seen a hurricane with a hundred—top winds of 178 miles an hour.I mean—so they're looking at these things. They're seeing more—the waters warming. They're seeing a whole range of things occurring around the world that haven't happened. And it's, sort of, like, Whoa, whoa.Because I don't get what I used to get when I started—I don't—there's no reason why anyone would remember this, but back when a fine Republican, a guy named Dick Lugar, was—from the State of Indiana—and he and I were either the chairmen or ranking members of the Foreign Relations Committee. This was over 20 years ago. We ended up proposing—and it worked, but it got no enthusiasm—a thing for debt-for-nature swaps. And people looked at us like: What in the hell are you doing? Why are you forgiving the debt so Brazil won't, you know, burn down more of their forest? Or, Why are you doing that so they will do—now everybody goes: Whoa. What else can you do? What else can you do?So I think there's a whole different attitude that's out there. And I think this is being led—and I'm not being solicitous here—I think this is being led by, you know, my granddaughters and their friends, that generation.

Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is to make sure that my Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, working with Larry Summers, my National Economic Adviser, and others, are coming up with the best possible plan to use this money wisely--in a way that's transparent; in a way that provides clear oversight; that we are conditioning any money that we give to banks on them reducing executive compensation to reasonable levels; and to make sure that they're not wasting that money.We are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restored within the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is that nobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank, they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open things up and restore some trust.We also have to deal with the housing issue in a clear and consistent way. I don't want to preempt my Secretary of the Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been, let's get this right, let's create a template in which we're restoring market confidence. And the reason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we're going to need additional money or how much additional money we'll need until we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidence in the marketplace, that the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing. That can make a big difference in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace.And ultimately, the Government cannot substitute for all the private capital that has been withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence so that private capital goes back in.Okay. Jake [Jake Tapper, ABC News].", "label": "General"}

I had met with him before when he came over here and found him to be a very engaging, energetic, smart, capable person. We will have our differences, and we will have our agreements. And I'm looking forward to working with him.Vice President Cheney is in the Middle East. His first message to the Iraqis was that they have got to speed up their clock, that—I agree with General Petraeus's assessment that there are two clocks: one ticking here in Washington and one ticking there. And they must understand that we are very serious when it comes to them passing law that enables this country to more likely reconcile. And then he'll be traveling to talk to other friends in the area.One of the questions that many ask is, do we understand the Iranian issue well? Do we understand the consequences of Iran having a nuclear weapon—which it looks like they want to try to achieve— to get. And the answer is, absolutely. And they'll find a stalwart friend in dealing with extremism in that vital part of the world. And that—Vice President will lay out our strategy of convincing others to join us in— on this Iranian issue. He will point out to them that we have worked hard to convince not only the EU-3 to join with the United States in sending a clear message but also now Russia and China, and that we do have a diplomatic front. And we've got to work—to continue to work together. We've got to work to keep it together, to send a focused, concerted message.He will also remind people that success in Iraq will be important for dealing with Iran, that if we were to listen to some of the voices in Congress and withdraw before the job was done, it would embolden Iran.

{"sentence": " How is the dynamic of frustration with the lack of political progress in Iraq changing? [SEP] In my speech, I made it clear that there has to be a change in security for there to be reconciliation. And I also said that progress will yield fewer troops. In other words, return on success is what I said.There are two types of reconciliation, David. One is that reconciliation, that very visible reconciliation that happens through the passage of law. In other words, it's reconciliation that shows the i people that people from different backgrounds can get along and, at the same time, that Government can function. Clearly, there needs to be work there. In other words, there needs to be the passage of law. For example, we strongly believe that an oil revenue sharing law will send a message to Sunni, Shi'a, and Kurd alike that there is an effort at the national level to achieve reconciliation.Having said that, however, there is a functioning government. And the reason I bring—I guess my point is this, that in spite of the fact they haven't passed a law, there is the sharing of oil revenues on a relatively equitable basis. The other—and so we'll continue to work with the Government to insist and impress upon them the need for there to be the passage of law, whether it be Provincial election laws or de-Ba'athification law or the oil law.There is local reconciliation taking place. I had a fascinating conversation in the Roosevelt Room earlier this week with members of Provincial Reconstruction Teams from around , who talked about how people are sick and tired of murder and violence and that they expect their local governments and their central Government to be more responsive to their needs. And local governments are beginning to respond.Part of the reason why there is not this kind of instant democracy in is because people are still recovering from Sad-dam Hussein's brutal rule. I thought an interesting comment was made when somebody said to me—I heard somebody say, where's Mandela? Well, Mandela is dead because Saddam Hussein killed all the Mandelas. He was a brutal tyrant that divided people up and split families, and people are recovering from this. So there's a psychological recovery that is taking place. And it's hard work for them. And I understand it's hard work for them. Having said that, I'm not going to give them a pass when it comes to the central Government's reconciliation efforts.I also said in my speech, local politics will drive national politics.

It's also important for the stability of and for the region.But I think one of the things that we've learned from the Afghanistan experience is for us to stay focused on the counterterrorism issue, to work with the Government, to not overextend ourselves, to operate smartly in dealing with these issues.

And so this is part of the reason why not only is NATO important, but these partnerships that we're establishing is important, because there are going to be times where these partners have more effective intelligence operations, more diplomatic contacts, et cetera, in some of these parts of the world where the state is a little wobbly and you may see terrorists attempting to infiltrate or set up bases.Yes, I'm going to call on Jake Tapper [ABC News] because, Jake, Jay Carney told me that you've been talking to some of our troops in Afghanistan.

First question was related to policies back home, related to Guantanamo or the death penalty. And then you wanted to talk about drones, or did you just want to focus on the drone question? I just want to make sure that I'm responsive to your question. I guess I ought to answer on the drones. And Guantanamo, that was a question, I believe, addressed to you. . Okay. Well, it continues to be my policy that I want to close Guantanamo. It has been more difficult than I had hoped, in part because there's been significant resistance from Congress on this, and on some issues, I need congressional authorization.But about a month ago I gave a speech in which I said that I would redouble my efforts to do so. Because 9/11 happened, and we now have been involved in one form or another in a war for over a decade. One war, I think, in Afghanistan, was necessary. One war I disagreed with strongly. But in either case, there are dangers if we get on a perpetual war footing.The threat of terrorism remains real, and we have to be vigilant, and we have to take steps to protect ourselves, consistent with our values and consistent with international law. But we also have to guard against being so driven by fear that we are not changing the fabric of our society in ways that we don't intend and do not want for the future. I think closing Guantanamo is an example of us getting out of that perpetual war mentality.Some of thepeople at Guantanamo are dangerous. Some of them did bad things. But we cannot have a permanent outpost in which they're being held even as we're ending a war in Afghanistan that triggered some of these—the capture of some of these detainees in the first place.So I'm confident that we can continue to make progress on this front, although, you're right, it has not been as fast as I would have liked. One of the things you discover as a politician is, is that people don't always do exactly what you want. It's shocking. And then you have to keep on working at it.One thing with respect to drone policy: In that speech that I gave, I also addressed that issue of—that, the lethal targeting of identified terrorists. This also is a source of controversy. We have constrained it tightly. And as we defeat Al Qaida, we have to, I think, very carefully examine how these technologies are used. I can say, though, that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones to go after counter—as part of our counterterrorism activities. And so I know that there have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case. That is not. Let me complement by saying that the United States of America have bases here, they have soldiers here. They fulfill a very important function, particularly in the fight against terrorism. If I think of Ramstein, for example—and also supplies to soldiers, but also caring for wounded soldiers.We as allies, as members of NATO, stand shoulder to shoulder here. And we provide bases for our activities, and our work is based also on shared values. As I said, we exchange on—have exchanges on values. But I think it's good. I think it's the right thing to do for the United States of America to be present here with military bases in Germany.

Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of— in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people—nations in our alliance—to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this—of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq. So the question nations have to ask: Is it worth it? And my answer is, absolutely, it's worth it—and so is the President—it's worth it for our own security, and it's worth it for the cause of peace. Thank you. Regarding Afghanistan, we have a main idea that any lack of success of the NATO in Afghanistan will diminish dramatically the credibility of our organization. And for the time being, the civilized world don't have alternatives to the security than NATO. We have to do everything what we can in order to make a success in our action in Afghanistan: granting democratic development of the country, economic development of the country, security of the country, and eliminating the terrorist risks which are generated by this region.

He's got to deal with the hatred that is left over from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.There's a lot of people still furious about what happened to them during Saddam Hussein's period.

[] No, look, the United States makes no apology—and I make no apologies, since I wrote it for—the legislation you're talking about.But there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation—and that has almost $368 billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all—of all of history. And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it.For example, there's a provision in it that says that there is the exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. Well, that was added by a Member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just meant allies; he didn't mean, literally, free trade agreement. So there's a lot we can work out.But the essence of it is, we're going to make sure that the United States continues—and just as I hope Europe will be able to continue—not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain. We're—we are our own supply chain, and we share that with Europe and all of our allies. And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing.So there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and/or be on their own. But that is something that is a matter to be worked out.There is no fundamental—it was never intended, when I wrote the legislation—I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us. That was not the intention.The intention was to make sure we no longer were in a position—when there was a pandemic in Asia, and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. We invented the damn things, you know? []So it's—anyway—but my point is, we're back in business, Europe is back in business, and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.[.] What we've been discussing with President Biden and what, as a matter of fact, he just said—and that's what I talked about with the caucus yesterday—that simple: The United States of America adopted a piece of legislation for their country, for their industry, which—with a common objective, goal that we share: creating jobs, creating opportunities for the middle class, and succeeding in implementing the energy transition.The reality is that the consequences, as we've seen in our discussions—it is certainly not the intention of the United States, but, as a matter of fact, projects that were growing—being developed in Europe, there's such a difference in subsidies that these projects might come to an end.And a number of Senators, yesterday, like—said it was certainly not their intention. So France simply did not come to ask for an exemption or another for our economy, but simply to discuss the consequences of this legislation.And the news—the circumstances mean that we have no alternative, but to work together. So, therefore, I believe we need to resynchronize, as I say, find a new policy to clarify our goals and continue together. And the discussion we had this morning was extremely clear. And I could feel the very same intent on behalf of the Members of the Congress yesterday.And the wish of President Biden is to rebuild a strong industry here and to have somehow to secure some technology solutions for the future. France wishes exactly the same thing for itself. And we're—we've been fighting, day in, day out, to do the very same thing in our country. And this will enable us to put an end to some 15 years of industry loss in our country and to have new manufacturing jobs.And so we'll be working on that. And we decided to do that together with the other members of the European Union and the European Commission. So we will work on the technical elements to make sure that there is no domino effect on ongoing projects in Europe. We want to succeed together, not one against the other.It's been clear.

And I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business, obviously, was hit very hard.We had a tremendous success out in Oakland where we moved it. Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K. We worked with Canada. They took their people back. And Canada has approximately 600 people; U.K., likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom.And we have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really—you don't hear about it anymore. It worked out really well.Mike, you may even want to say something about that because that was really done properly. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And that program with the Grand Princess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards, orderly way, as the President directed. And Americans that needed treatment have received them.[]And what the President has directed us to do is, whether there is a pause in the moment, as some cruise lines are doing, and as we all continue to discuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this, that cruise lines and the medical services that are available, and for the passengers and all of the crew, that cruise lines are safer than ever before and can prosper for many years to come.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": " Isn't it time for your strategy to change? [SEP] Well, keep in mind what we have been doing. We have a military strategy that involves putting enormous pressure on ISIL through airstrikes, that has put assistance and training on the ground with Iraqi forces. We're now working with Syrian forces as well to squeeze ISIL, cut off their supply lines. We've been coordinating internationally to reduce their financing capabilities, the oil that they're trying to ship outside. We are taking strikes against high-value targets, including, most recently, against the individual who was on the video executing civilians who had already been captured, as well as the head of ISIL in Libya. So it's not just in Iraq and Syria.And so on the military front, we are continuing to accelerate what we do. As we find additional partners on the ground that are effective, we work with them more closely. I've already authorized additional Special Forces on the ground who are going to be able to improve that coordination.On the counterterrorism front, keep in mind that since I came into office, we have been worried about these kinds of attacks. The vigilance that the United States Government maintains and the cooperation that we're consistently expanding with our European and other partners in going after every single terrorist network is robust and constant. And every few weeks, I meet with my entire national security team, and we go over every single threat stream that is presented, and where we have relevant information, we share it immediately with our counterparts around the world, including our European partners.On aviation security, we have, over the last several years, been working so that at various airports sites—not just in the United States, but overseas—we are strengthening our mechanisms to screen and discover passengers who should not be boarding flights and improving the manners in which we are screening luggage that is going onboard.And on the diplomatic front, we've been consistently working to try to get all the parties together to recognize that there is a moderate opposition inside of Syria that can form the basis for a transition government and to reach out not only to our friends, but also to the Russians and the Iranians who are on the other side of this equation to explain to them that ultimately an organization like ISIL is the greatest danger to them, as well as to us.So there will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward, but the strategy that we are putting forward is the strategy that ultimately is going to work. But as I said from the start, it's going to take time.And what's been interesting is, in the aftermath of Paris, as I listen to those who suggest something else needs to be done, typically, the things they suggest need to be done are things we are already doing. The one exception is that there have been a few who have suggested that we should put large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground.And keep in mind that we have the finest military in the world and we have the finest military minds in the world, and I've been meeting with them intensively for years now, discussing these various options, and it is not just my view, but the view of my closest military and civilian advisers that that would be a mistake, not because our military could not march into Mosul or Raqqa or Ramadi and temporarily clear out ISIL, but because we would see a repetition of what we've seen before, which is, if you do not have local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes, that they resurface, unless we're prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries.And let's assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there's a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if there's a terrorist network that's operating anywhere else in North Africa or in Southeast Asia?So a strategy has to be one that can be sustained. And the strategy that we're pursuing, which focuses on going after targets, limiting wherever possible the capabilities of ISIL on the ground, systematically going after their leadership, their infrastructure, strengthening Shia—or strengthening Syrian and Iraqi forces that are—and Kurdish forces that are prepared to fight them, cutting off their borders and squeezing the space in which they can operate until ultimately we're able to defeat them—that's the strategy we're going to have to pursue.And we will continue to generate more partners for that strategy. And there are going to be some things that we try that don't work; there will be some strategies we try that do work. And when we find strategies that work, we will double down on those.

{"sentence": "Did you ask the President to rethink his decision to remove North Korea from the list? If not, why not? [SEP] North Korea is the most sanctioned nation in the world and will remain the most sanctioned nation in the world. And the way for them to get off their sanctions is to honor their commitments in a verifiable fashion.Somehow there's this notion—inherent in your question is the delisting therefore took away their sanctions. That's just not an accurate statement on your part if you think that. I'm not assuming you do think that, but it's—they're a highly sanctioned regime. And they will—as I said, they've got a lot of obligations that they must fulfill in order for these sanctions to leave.And that's why I said it is action for action. And the first step was taken. Now, one thing is for certain, I repeat—I don't know if you saw it on your—on the TVs here, but the destruction of the cooling tower was verifiable action. And that's a positive step. But as I mentioned in my opening statement, we have other concerns, and one such concern, of course, is the abduction issue. Well, the North Korean declaration on their nuclear pro-grams—well, when you think about the abduction issue, I think the suggestion of your question—what you were suggesting is that we should seek U.S. to rescind that decision. Well, as far as nuclear issue is concerned, well, we have moved on to a new phase. And I think we need to make sure this will be successful because it will be in the interest of Japan as well. At the same time, in parallel, we need to bring the abduction issue to successful conclusion as well.So against this backdrop of progress in the nuclear front, we need to also strive for progress on the abduction front as well. And to that end, we need to have good-faith discussions with North Korea. And so far, we have not seen any progress, but we need to engage in negotiations so that progress will be produced. Because abduction is not progressing, on the nuclear front we should not make progress—that is something we should not—we should avoid. And I believe we need to make progress on both fronts, because that will be important for Japan, and I think that will be necessary for North Korea as well.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": " Why shouldn't people conclude that you are either stubborn, in denial, but certainly not realistic about the strategy that you've pursued since then? [SEP] You know, it's interesting; it turns out, Mike Hayden—I think you're quoting Mike Hayden there—was in this morning to give me his weekly briefing, and I asked him about that newspaper article from which you quote. His answer was—his comments to the Iraq Study Group was a little more nuanced than the quotation you read.He said that he made it clear the current strategy in Iraq wasn't working—this is his recollection of the briefing to the Iraq Study Group. He briefed them to the fact it wasn't working and that we needed a change of direction. He also said that those who suggest that we back away and let the Iraqi's Government do it—this is in November 2006—let the Iraqis handle it, don't understand the inability of the Iraq Government at that time to take on that responsibility.He then went on to say—this is what he—his recollection of his conversation— was that our strategy needed to help get the violence down so that there could be political reconciliation from the top down as well as the bottom up.There has been political reconciliation, Martha, from the bottom up. Anbar Province is a place where the experts had— an expert had said that it was impossible for us to achieve our objective. This was the part of the country of Iraq where Al Qaida had made it clear that they would like to establish a safe haven from which to plan, plot further attacks and to spread their ideology throughout the Middle East. Since then, since this November 2006 report and since that statement to the Iraq Study Group, things have changed appreciably on the ground in Anbar Province.And they're beginning to have the same change, because the people on the ground there are sick and tired of violence and being threatened by people like Al Qaida, who have no positive vision for the future. And there's been a significant turn, where now Sunni sheikhs and Sunni citizens are working with the coalition to bring justice to Al Qaida killers. And that same approach is being taken in Diyala.And so there's a lot of focus, and should be frankly on oil laws or elections.

{"sentence": " Are these bumps along the road, or are you seeing a deterioration in the relationship, based on the Koran burning itself, the violence that has followed, that inhibits your ability to work out things like how to hand off the detention center? [SEP] No, I--none of this stuff is easy, and it never has been. And obviously, the most recent riots or protests against the Koran burning were tragic, but remember, this happened a while back when a pastor in Florida threatened to burn a Koran. In Iraq, as we were making this transition, there were constant crises that would pop up and tragic events that would take place and there would be occasional setbacks.But what I've tried to do is to set a course, make sure that up and down the chain of command everybody knows what our broader strategy is. And one of the incredible things about our military is that when they know what our objective is, what our goal is, regardless of the obstacles that they meet along the way, they get the job done.And I think that President Karzai understands that we are interested in a strategic partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan Government. We are not interested in staying there any longer than is necessary to assure that Al Qaida is not operating there and that there is sufficient stability that it doesn't end up being a free-for-all after ISAF has left.And so we share interests here.

First, we were concerned that an early disclosure would increase the risk of a confrontation in the Middle East or retaliation in the Middle East. As I mentioned to you early on, we did notify 22 Members of Congress, key committee chairmen. And I was—I'm mindful that there was going to be this kind of reaction. And we—of course, we wanted to include more Members of Congress at a time when we felt the risk of retaliation or confrontation in the Middle East was reduced. And so that moment came upon us and then extended the briefings.We also wanted to advance certain policy objectives through the disclosures.

{"sentence": " Isn't consumer spending or overspending how we got into this mess? [SEP] Well, first of all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What got us into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies based on shaky assets. And because of the enormous leverage where they had $1 worth of assets and they were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in the financial system. That led to a contraction of credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meant that everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy, so people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investment, initiated layoffs, which in turn made things worse.Now, you are making a legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined and this economy has been driven by consumer spending for a very long time, and that's not going to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending, and we're not making things, then over time other countries are going to get tired of lending us money and eventually the party is going to be over. Well, in fact, the party now is over.And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows: Our immediate job is to stop the downward spiral, and that means putting money into consumers' pockets, it means loosening up credit, it means putting forward investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth. And that, by the way, is important even if you're a fiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have with our Federal budget is if we continue a situation in which there are no tax revenues because economic growth is plummeting at the same time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance, we've got more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the Federal budget as well as the State budget.So the most important thing we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the economic recovery plan is the right thing to do, even though I recognize that it's expensive. Look, I would love not to have to spend money right now. I'd--this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, that wasn't how I envisioned my Presidency beginning, but we have to adapt to existing circumstances.Now, what we are going to also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we're no longer contracting but we're growing; that our mid-term and long-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true for individual consumers. Right now they're just trying to figure out, how do I make sure that if I lose my job, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments. Or they're worried about how am I going to pay next month's bills. So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financial planning.Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a free lunch. So if you want to get--if you want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably not affordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has to be reconsidered.So we're going to have to change our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out of the economic slump that we're in.All right. Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg.", "label": "Explicit"}

It's expected to reduce poverty—child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms.

We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours—needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests.

Let me take them in turn.First of all, with respect to Cuba, there is majority support of our policy in the United States, and there's overwhelming support for our policy in Cuba. I think people recognize that if you keep on doing something for 50 years and it doesn't work, you should try something new.And so the American people don't need to be persuaded that this is, in fact, the right thing to do. I recognize that there are still concerns and questions that Congress may have; we've got concerns and questions about specific activities that are taking place in Cuba and human rights and reform. And there were two members of the Cuban civil society that were in attendance at the meeting that I had yesterday who expressed much of what they have to go through on a day-to-day basis. They were supportive of our policy of engagement with Cuba.And so I don't think that it's so much we have to persuade anybody. The issue of the state sponsor of terrorism list, as you know, the State Department has provided a recommendation; it's gone through our interagency process. I'll be honest with you, I have been on the road, and I want to make sure that I have a chance to read it, study it, before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be.But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people-to-people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for the Cuban people.Now, with respect to Iran, I have always been clear: We are not done yet. What we were able to obtain was a political framework between the P-5-plus-1 nations and Iran that provided unprecedented verification of what is taking place in Iran over the next two decades that significantly cuts back on its centrifuges, that cuts off pathways for it to obtain a nuclear weapon, and that calls for, in return, the rolling back of sanctions in a phased way that allows us to snap back if Iran violates the agreement. That's the political framework. That was not just something that the United States and Iran agreed to, but Iran agreed to a political framework with the other P-5-plus-1 nations.Now, what's always been clear is, is that Iran has its own politics around this issue. They have their own hardliners. They have their own countervailing impulses in terms of whether or not to go forward with something, just as we have in our country. And so it's not surprising to me that the Supreme Leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position. But I know what was discussed at—in arriving at the political agreement.What I've always said, though, is that there's the possibility of backsliding. There's the possibility that it doesn't get memorialized in a way that satisfies us that we're able to verify that, in fact, Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon and that we are preserving the capacity to snap back sanctions in the event that they are breaking any deal.And that's why the work is going to be so important between now and the end of June to memorialize this so that we can all examine it. And we don't have to speculate on what the meaning of a deal is going to be. Either there's going to be a document that Iran agrees with the world community about and a series of actions that have to be taken, or there's not. Part of the challenge in this whole process has been, opponents of basically any deal with Iran have constantly tried to characterize what the deal is without seeing it.Now, if we are able to obtain a final deal that comports with the political agreement—and I say if because that's not yet final—then I'm absolutely positive that that is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And that's not my opinion; that's the opinion of people like Ernie Moniz, my Secretary of Energy, who is a physicist from MIT and actually knows something about this stuff. That's the opinion of a whole bunch of nuclear experts who examined the deal.I mean, very rarely do you see a consensus—consensus too strong a word—a large majority of people who are experts in the field saying this is actually a realistic, plausible, meaningful approach to cut off the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon and that it is more likely to succeed not only than maintaining current sanctions or additional sanctions, but more likely to succeed than if we took a military approach to solving the problem.Again, that's not uniquely my opinion. That is—talk to the people who are not affiliated with the administration, some of whom were skeptical about our capacity to get a deal done and have now looked at it and said if we're able to actually get what was discussed in the political framework, it's absolutely the right thing to do.Now, there's politics and political pressure inside of the United States. We all know that. The Prime Minister of Israel is deeply opposed to it. I think he's made that very clear. And I have repeatedly asked, what is the alternative that you present that you think makes it less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon? And I have yet to obtain a good answer on that.And the narrow question that's going to be presented next week when Congress comes back is, what's Congress's appropriate role in looking at a final deal? And I've talked to not only Bob Corker, but I've talked to Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the Democratic side. And I want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when it's done. What I'm concerned about is making sure that we don't prejudge it or those who are opposed to any deal whatsoever try to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal.Last comment I'm going to make on this: When I hear some, like Senator McCain recently, suggest that our Secretary of State, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this Nation, is somehow less trustworthy in the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries. And we're seeing this again and again. We saw it with the letter by the 47 Senators who communicated directly—[]—to the Supreme Leader of Iran—the person that they say can't be trusted at all—warning him not to trust the United States Government.We have Mitch McConnell trying to tell the world, oh, don't have confidence in the U.S. Government's abilities to fulfill any climate change pledge that we might make. And now we have a Senator suggesting that our Secretary of State is purposely misinterpreting the deal and giving the Supreme Leader of Iran the benefit of the doubt in the interpretations.That's not how we're supposed to run foreign policy, regardless of who is President or Secretary of State. We can have arguments, and there are legitimate arguments to be had. I understand why people might be mistrustful of Iran. I understand why people might oppose the deal, although the reason is not because this is a bad deal per se, but they just don't trust any deal with Iran and may prefer to take a military approach to it.But when you start getting to the point where you are actively communicating that the United States Government and our Secretary of State is somehow spinning presentations in a negotiation with a foreign power, particularly one that you say is your enemy, that's a problem. It needs to stop.Jim Acosta [CNN]. Oh, I'm sorry, where's Jim?", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Are you prepared to state unequivocally that you would veto a Keystone pipeline bill if it comes to your desk? [SEP] I had naturally several interactions with President Putin during the course of the APEC summit and then here at the G-20. I would characterize them as typical of our interactions, which are businesslike and blunt. And my communications to him was no different than what I've said publicly as well as what I've said to him privately over the course of this crisis in Ukraine, and that is, Russia has the opportunity to take a different path, to resolve the issue of Ukraine in a way that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and is consistent with international law. That is our preference, and if it does so, then I will be the first to suggest that we roll back the sanctions that are frankly having a devastating effect on the Russian economy.If he continues down the path that he is on—violating international law, providing heavy arms to the separatists in Ukraine, violating an agreement that he agreed to just a few weeks ago, the Minsk agreement, that would have lowered the temperature and the killing in the disputed areas and make providing us a pathway for a diplomatic resolution—then the isolation that Russia is currently experiencing will continue.And in my meeting with European leaders, they confirmed their view that so far, Russia has not abided by either the spirit or the letter of the agreement that Mr. Putin signed—or agreed to, and that as a consequence, we are going to continue to maintain the economic isolation while maintaining the possibility of a diplomatic solution.It is not our preference to see Russia isolated the way it is. We would prefer a Russia that is fully integrated with the global economy, that is thriving on behalf of its people, that can once again engage with us in cooperative efforts around global challenges. But we're also very firm on the need to uphold core international principles.

Will you cooperate with those subpoenas? [SEP] Well, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what's been playing out, John, for the last—since my election, I would say. If you wanted—probably, we'll find out soon, but probably even before my election.This is a fraudulent crime on the American people. But we'll work together with Shifty Schiff and Pelosi and all of them, and we'll see what happens, because we did absolutely—I had a great call with the President of Ukraine. It was a hundred percent. You have the transcript. And then, Schiff went up, and he got—as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn't take place. He made up the language. I—hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.But he went up to the microphone, and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet—which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this—exact, word for word—he said, Wow, he didn't do anything wrong. So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out, and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said. It has to be a criminal act. It has to be. And he should resign. And some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing.And just so you know, the call was perfect, the real call; the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders—you can name any one of them—but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies. My knowledge—I know all about it. And so this isn't something like: Oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret. This is many people on the line. I don't even know how many. We'll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. He didn't say anything. He just—because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.But the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day—and previous to that—he announced through his spokesperson—said there was absolutely no pressure put on him. There was no quid pro quo, at all.

Because I don't like doing that. I don't want to do it. I hope I don't have to do it again: release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don't want to do that, John. I don't want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian Government. We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them, Would it be okay? Otherwise, I couldn't have done it.And if I wouldn't have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report—didn't he say, seven or eight times, I said quid pro quo? In other words, You're going to do this or you're not going to get money.Now, in all fairness—Biden said it, and he's on tape.

{"sentence": "If so, what is the single biggest mistake that you may have made? [SEP] Gotcha. Hey, look, I have often said that history will look back and determine that which could have been done better, or you know, mistakes I made. Clearly, putting a Mission Accomplished on a aircraft carrier was a mistake. It sent the wrong message. We were trying to say something differently, but nevertheless, it conveyed a different message. Obviously, some of my rhetoric has been a mistake.I've thought long and hard about Katrina, you know, could I have done something differently, like land Air Force One either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge. The problem with that and—is that law enforcement would have been pulled away from the mission. And then your questions, I suspect, would have been, How could you possibly have flown Air Force One into Baton Rouge, and police officers that were needed to expedite traffic out of New Orleans were taken off the task to look after you?I believe that running the Social Security idea right after the '04 elections was a mistake. I should have argued for immigration reform. And the reason why is, is that— you know, one of the lessons I learned as Governor of Texas, by the way, is legislative branches tend to be risk averse. In other words, sometimes legislatures have the tendency to ask, Why should I take on a hard task when a crisis is not imminent? And the crisis was not imminent for Social Security, as far as many Members of Congress was concerned.As an aside, one thing I proved is that you can actually campaign on the issue and get elected. In other words, I don't believe talking about Social Security is the third rail of American politics. I, matter of fact, think that in the future, not talking about how you intend to fix Social Security is going to be the third rail of American politics.And the one thing about the Presidency is that you can make—only make decisions, you know, on the information at hand. You don't get to have information after you've made the decision. That's not the way it works. And you stand by your decisions, and you do your best to explain why you made the decisions you made.There have been disappointments. Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment during the Presidency. Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment. I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but they were—things didn't go according to plan, let's put it that way.And anyway, I think historians will look back, and they'll be able to have a better look at mistakes after some time has passed. I—along Jake's question, there is no such thing as short-term history. I don't think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time has passed.

It is essential that the package be robust and strong to address the problem. I know—look, I'm sure there are some of my friends out there saying, I thought this guy was a market guy; what happened to him?Well, my first instinct wasn't to lay out a huge Government plan. My first instinct was to let the market work, until I realized that—upon being briefed by the experts, of how significant this problem became.And so I cid to act and act boldly. It turns out that there's a lot of interlinks throughout the financial system. The system had grown to a point where a lot of people were pennt upon each other, and that the collapse of one part of the system wouldn't just affect a part of the financial markets, it would affect the average citizen. And how? Well, it'd affect their capacity to borrow money to buy a house or to finance a college loan. It'd affect the ability of a small business to get credit.

And, you know, I tell our—I will tell our citizens and continue to remind them that the risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package and that, over time, we're going to get a lot of the money back.

In other words, we could—our intentions could be great to help al with FARC or extremists. But unless there's a well-organized government head by termined learship, that help doesn't work.And so the progress that's been ma is a tribute to the Colombian Government and Presint Uribe. The United States is a partner. But the truth of the matter is, the credit goes to the Uribe Government.And we will continue to stand with a Government that's willing to do hard things. And there's nothing harr than to al with FARC. But it's unniable that progress is being ma and that the FARC is weaker, FARC is on the run. People are leaving FARC because of the generous hand that the Government has reached out with.I unrstand how important the free tra agreement is to Colombia. It's not only economically important, because, as the Presint said, if the—there's doubt about the free tra agreement, investment will become nervous. And without investment, it's very hard for the Colombian economy to continue to sustain growth, and without economic growth, it's hard to be in a hopeful society.Secondly, the free tra agreement is more than just an economic agreement, it is a statement of friendship, it's a statement of common values. And if this agreement were not to pass, it would emboln the voices of populism in the neighborhood, to the triment of a Government which has been very strong in aling with human rights and human dignity and the market.And so I appreciate the Presint being here if this statement will help clarify the issue once again.

{"sentence": "To what extent do you think your successor may be a threat to global security? [SEP] My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it's not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world.And based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I've done a pretty good job, that we haven't, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it.But what is certainly true is that the American people—just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world—are seeing extraordinarily rapid change. The world is shrinking. Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting. Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct. People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security. They're looking for some means of control.And what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries.And I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase. But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles—as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them, but also change governments if it's—they're not serving them well—then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue.And I think it's especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it's particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries—those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization—and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.And I think that can be done. But it's hard. It requires creativity. It requires effective communications. Part of what's changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information. It's easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we'll figure it out.So, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America's futures, but the direction that the world is going in. And part of what makes me most optimistic is, if you look at the attitudes of young people. Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences. They are much more comfortable with diversity. They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between us and them. They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders.So that's where the future is. But we have to create that bridge to the future. And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped to get us here. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. Well, on the issue, first, of independence of Germany, after the time of National Socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America. The fact that we were able to enjoy European—sorry, German unification is due, first and foremost, to the help of the United States of America. And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country.Now, we're trying to do more than it used to be 26 years ago. And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution. We will all have to make—do more in development cooperation. It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked. Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate, which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union. We cannot stand alone with 80 million people. In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much, even though you may be economically strong. So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation. And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole.Secondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at—and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States. Look at the European Parliament. We—there are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, for—who are sort of preaching policies of, well, very unfriendly policies. We have them here in Europe too. We have them here in Germany too.And to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society. Look at the history of the printing press, when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had, or industrialization, what sort of consequences that had. Very often, it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this. And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a transition from agricultural societies to industrial societies.Now, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country. We have it in other countries. Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days—trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place.But those that are—belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others—that is something that we cannot allow to happen. That is something that I think, at the time in the GDR—at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people—that was something that filled me with great joy. But the fact that these people have hijacked it certain is not something that fills me with great joy. We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people. But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so.Now, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard. If you've worked together with somebody very well, leave-taking is very difficult. But we are all politicians. We all know that democracy lives off change. So, in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this. It's a tough rule: Eight years, and that's it. Out goes the President, and a new one comes in. So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead. But our personal—we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game. So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say.

[SEP] Well, let me take the second question first This is ultimately a negotiation between Cypriots: Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots And the good news is that you have two leaders who seem genuinely committed to finding compromises and an approach that would serve both their peoples well If in fact you can see a meeting of the minds between them, then the issue will be can we make sure that all of us, the international community—Turkey, Greece, the United States—support that agreement in a way that can be ratified by both sides And we have invested a lot of time Vice President Biden has been actively involved in this We are encouraged by the progress that's been made I think there's a window in the next few weeks, months, where this issue was actually resolved And I think if we can find an equitable solution, it won't provide a hundred percent of what either side wants, there may be some mechanisms for a transition from the status quo to the future that both sides envision, but I think it's achievable And we're going to do everything we can to support the processWith respect to the economy and Europe, again, I think it's important to recognize that in some ways my job was simpler because, at least in the first 2 years, I had majorities of my party controlling Congress And I'm just one country [] So Congress is hard to deal with [] Dealing with multiple Parliaments and commissions and unions and this and that and the other and—that's very complicated And so the need, I think, to operate by consensus, the fact that not all European countries were similarly situated, even though their economy shared a currency, that made their task more difficult And so I want to make sure that I'm clear that I don't envy the hard job that each European leader had in circumstances that oftentimes they had inheritedWhat I've tried to do is just offer our best thinking, whether it's in resolving problems in banks quickly—because the quicker you resolve the problems with banks and there's transparency in that process, the faster they recapitalize and are able to make investments When the economy is shrinking, providing jobs, spending on things like infrastructure can actually increase revenue and drive down debt And then, there's going to be a time at which point that has to be taken care ofI mean, for example, in the United States, our deficits went up in those first 2 years because we were engaging in a lot of emergency spending Our deficits have now been reduced by two-thirds, primarily because we started growing again, and we started taking in more tax revenueSo there's some lessons, I think, that are applicable for all countries And what we've just tried to do is offer the best advice that we can, understanding that when you're dealing with multiple nations, but a single currency, and then a European Union, where some people are in the currency and some people are not in the currency, and a European Parliament and European Council and—that's a lot of meetings [] Okay?Prime Minister Tsipras I will fully agree with what has just said in answering the question about Cyprus It is not a bilateral issue It is not a problem between Greece and Turkey It's an international problem, which has been going on for 42 years—as long as I'm alive—and it is a problem of illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus We make our best, we do our best in—to encourage both sides to help them reach a fair and equitable and sustainable solutionIn my first visit to Cyprus as a Prime Minister, I tried and I did meet over and above the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, a number of representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community And I think that that was the first time that a Greek Prime Minister was meeting with them We are interested in making sure that the people of Cyprus will be able to live in a reunited Cyprus where they are free, where there's a democracy, freedom, and Cyprus is a member of the European UnionSo I would like to make it clear that as regards Greece, we are in favor of a solution We stand by the side of President Anastasiadis, who is making the effort, and we are only ready to discuss with Turkey the part which is relevant to us; that is the guarantees Because since 1959, since 1960, this obsolete issue of guarantees also concerns Greece But Greece is not the country which has occupied and illegally—invaded and illegally occupied CyprusSo I believe that a fair and sustainable solution means a solution without the permanent presence of Turkish troops on the island And at the same time, I think that the best guarantee for the Cypriot people to feel safe is the potential of a fair and sustainable solution And if this happens, things will change not only for Cyprus, but for the wider region, in general and for Greek-Turkish relations This is how we are proceedingI believe that, yes, President Erdogan plays an important role, but it is not my responsibility to convince him, Mr Ignoti The final question will come from Chris Jansing with NBC News", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": " Clarification of the President's conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy regarding Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [SEP] Could I just say that Chuck's the only guy who asked two questions so far. So just--when I cut off here, whoever was next in the queue--[]--I'm messing with you, Chuck.With respect to the supercommittee, in August we negotiated to initiate a trillion dollars in cuts over the next 10 years, primarily out of discretionary spending, but we also said that in order for us to move towards a more stable fiscal condition that we're going to have to get an additional 1.2, minimum. I actually argued that we needed more than that. And the whole idea of the sequester was to make sure that both sides felt obligated to move off rigid positions and do what was required to help the country.And since that time, they've had a lot of conversations, but it feels as if people continue to try to stick with their rigid positions rather than solve the problem.Now, I've put forward a very detailed approach that would achieve $3 trillion-plus in savings. And it's the sort of balanced approach that the American people prefer. It says everything's on the table. We've got to have discretionary spending cuts of the sort we've already put in place. We've got to have nondefense cuts. We've got to have defense cuts. We're going to have to look at entitlement programs. We've got to reduce our health care costs. And we're going to need additional revenue.And when we're talking about revenue, if we've got to raise money, it makes sense for us to start by asking the wealthiest among us to pay a little bit more before we start asking seniors, for example, to pay a lot more for their Medicare.Now, this is the same presentation that I made to Speaker Boehner back in August. It's the same kind of balanced approach that every single independent committee that's looked at this has said needs to be done. And it just feels as if people keep on wanting to jigger the math so that they get a different outcome.Well, the equation, no matter how you do it, is going to be the same. If you want a balanced approach that doesn't gut Medicare and Medicaid, doesn't prevent us from making investments in education and basic science and research--all the things we've been talking about here at APEC, that every world leader understands is the key for long-term economic success--then prudent cuts have to be matched up with revenue.My hope is that over the next several days, the congressional leadership on the supercommittee go ahead and bite the bullet and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change. There's no magic formula. There are no magic beans that you can toss on the ground, and suddenly, a bunch of money grows on trees. We got to just go ahead and do the responsible thing. And I'm prepared to sign legislation that is balanced, that solves this problem.One other thing that I want to say about this: When I meet with world leaders, what's striking--whether it's in Europe or here in Asia--the kinds of fundamental reforms and changes both on the revenue side and the public pension side that other countries are having to make are so much more significant than what we need to do in order to get our books in order.This doesn't require radical changes to America or its way of life. It just means that we spread out the sacrifice across every sector so that it's fair, so that people don't feel as if once again people who are well connected, people who have lobbyists, special interests get off easy, and the burden is placed on middle class families that are already struggling. So if other countries can do it, we can do it, and we can do it in a responsible way.I'm not going to comment on whether I'd veto a particular bill until I actually see a bill, because I still hold out the prospect that there's going to be a light-bulb moment where everybody says: Aha! Here's what we've got to do.With respect to the hot mike in France, I'm not going to comment on conversations that I have with individual leaders, but what I will say is this: The primary conversation I had with President Sarkozy in that meeting revolved around my significant disappointment that France had voted in favor of the Palestinians joining UNESCO, knowing full well that under our laws, that would require the United States cutting off funding to UNESCO, and after I had consistently made the argument that the only way we're going to solve the Middle East situation is if Palestinians and Israelis sit down at the table and negotiate, that it is not going to work to try to do an end run through the United Nations.So I had a very frank and firm conversation with President Sarkozy about that issue. And that is consistent with both private and public statements that I've been making to everybody over the last several months.Ed Henry [FOX News].", "label": "Declining to answer"}

They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess.They went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings—right?—like courthouses.The Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency—which I consider now to be an emergency—it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement.Yesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it—and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, I think Trump wants to take over the country. It's crazy.So what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters—and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists.

There's a lot of opinions on both sides of the aisle about this issue. And my message to the Members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let's make sure our troops get funded, and let's make sure politicians don't tell our commanders how to conduct operations. Let's don't hamstring our people in the field. That's my message.Their message to me has been, you know, don't you think the Iraqi Government ought to do more? They recognize what I recognize, and these gentlemen up here particularly recognize: that without political progress, it's going to be hard to achieve a military victory in Iraq. In other words, the military can provide security so a political process can go forward.Look, the two questions you asked: One was about General Petraeus's report to the—back—around September about what's taking place in Baghdad. My attitude toward Congress is, why don't you wait and see what he says? Fund the troops, and let him come back and report to the American people. General Petraeus picked this date. He believes that there will be enough progress one way or the other to be able to report to the American people, to give an objective assessment about what he sees regarding the Baghdad security plan.It's at that point in time that I'm confident that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs will take a look at what David Petraeus says and make recommendations about troop levels based upon the conditions on the ground, which stands in stark contrast to Members of Congress who say, we're going to determine troop levels based upon politics or the latest opinion poll or how we can get our Members elected.And the second part of your question was about benchmarks. Look, let me talk about this recent effort by Congress to fund our troops. The idea that the House of Representatives put forward is one that we will fund our troops by piecemeal. Secretary Gates was very strong about why that's a bad idea. And the American people must understand that if you fund our troops every 2 months, you're in a—put in a position where we have to delay certain procurement, or that military contracts must be delayed. There's a lot of uncertainty in funding when it comes to 2-month cycles. So we reject that idea. It won't work.I find it odd that the Congress is—I find it ironic that the Congress is ready to fully fund unrelated domestic spending items and only one-half of the money requested for our troops. They provide 100 percent of the money for the special interest projects that—they don't have anything to do with fighting the war on terror, and 50 percent of the money to go to those who wear our uniform. They got it wrong. They ought to provide 100 percent of the money for people who wear the uniform and leave these special pork projects out of the bill. The—and so I'll veto the bill if it's this haphazard, piecemeal funding. And I made that clear.One message I have heard from people from both parties and—is that the idea of benchmarks makes sense. And I agree. It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward. And so I've empowered Josh Bolten to find common ground on benchmarks, and he will continue to have dialog with both Republicans and Democrats.You know, this bill—I believe we can get a good supplemental, and I hope it's as quick as possible. The first blush is the bad supplemental coming out of the House. Nevertheless, there is—the Senate will have a say, and then there will be a conference committee, and hopefully, we can move a good bill forward as quickly as possible.

And this is obvious for us, and we are thankful for the support. . Afghanistan is still a dangerous place. The way it's going to become less dangerous is by Afghan security forces and Afghan police being capable of keeping law and order and security in the country. And that is not going to happen if foreign forces are continually relied upon for the basic security of Afghanistan.So there are going to be specialized areas where we can cooperate, dealing with some of the most vicious terrorist networks. There's going to be intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism cooperation. And there are going to be specialized areas where we can provide logistical support and training and enabling support.But the fact is, is that unless Afghan soldiers and Afghan police are able to maintain security, at some point, someday, the United States and other coalition forces would leave. And the good news is, what we've seen as we've removed ourselves from combat roles is the Afghan security forces have stepped up. And although they're certainly not as well equipped as coalition forces, they're better equipped than the Taliban. They're better equipped than the Haqqani network.And so with the kind of leadership that President Ghani is showing as a Commander in Chief, with the leadership that's being shown by a growing cadre of military officers up and down the military chain, Afghan forces are proving themselves and discovering that, in fact, when they fight, they can be successful.

{"sentence": "Do you think there is a danger in questioning the integrity of institutions similar to how Donald Trump's team has done? [SEP] Well, on the latter point, as I said before, the transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. It's bumpy. There are still feelings that are raw out there. There are people who are still thinking about how things unfolded. And I get all that. But when Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn as the 45th President of the United States, then he's got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. And I've said this before: I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office. And I haven't shared previously private conversations I've had with the President-elect. I will say that they have been cordial and, in some cases, have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to ensure that regardless of our obvious deep disagreements about policy, maybe I can transmit some thoughts about maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can't say that he will end up implementing, but the conversations themselves have been cordial as opposed to defensive in any way. And I will always make myself available to him, just as previous Presidents have made themselves available to me as issues come up.With respect to the FBI, I will tell you, I've had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents, I know Director Comey. They take their job seriously, they work really hard, they help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. And it is always a challenge for law enforcement when there's an intersection between the work that they are doing and the political system. It's one of the difficulties of democracy, generally. We have a system where we want our law enforcement investigators and our prosecutors to be free from politics, to be independent, to play it straight, but sometimes, that involves investigations that touch on politics. And particularly in this hyperpartisan environment that we've been in, everything is suspect, everything you do one way or the other.One thing that I have done is to be pretty scrupulous about not wading into investigation decisions or prosecution decisions or decisions not to prosecute. I have tried to be really strict in my own behavior about preserving the independence of law enforcement, free from my own judgments and political assessments, in some cases.

The question is going to be, are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree? I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree.If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no. And I'm confident that I'll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions. But on increasing American exports, on simplifying our tax system, on rebuilding our infrastructure, my hope is that we can get some things done.I've never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren't for the executive actions, they would have been more productive. There's no evidence of that. So I intend to continue to do what I've been doing, which is, where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I'm going to do it. And I will then, side by side, reach out to Members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let's work together; I'd rather do it with you.Immigration is the classic example. I was really happy when the Senate passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. And I did everything I could for a year and a half to provide Republicans the space to act and showed not only great patience, but flexibility, saying to them, look, if there are specific changes you'd like to see, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to be patient, we're willing to work with you. Ultimately, it wasn't forthcoming.And so the question is going to be, I think, if executive actions on areas like minimum wage or equal pay or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans, if they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is, pass bills. And work with me to make sure I'm willing to sign those bills.Because both sides are going to have to compromise. On most issues, in order for their initiatives to become law, I'm going to have sign off. And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I'm going to have to take into account the issues that they care about.All right.

And we are happy to think that the opposition might like to support our foreign policy, and our foreign policy will go along the same lines that we pursued in our previous Government for those 5 years.And this is a pro-European integration foreign policy. It is a foreign policy which is based on the idea that we don't have two Western worlds, we don't have Europe on one side and the U.S. and Canada on the other. When we talk about the West, we mean only one West. And our foreign policy aims at being based on cordial relations with an important country such as the Russian Federation.So our policy is going to require our effort to strengthen the ties and the cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation. And it is a policy that will consider NATO to be the vehicle which will help to maintain and uphold peace throughout the world, as it has done over the past decades.Now, what about the wounds in the world, at—where we know that they're going to need our generosity?

{"sentence": "When should they look at this metric to assess progress? [SEP] I think my initial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line number one, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidence to make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence, and they start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one: job creation.Step number two: Are we seeing the credit markets operate effectively? I can't tell you how many businesses that I talk to that are successful businesses, but just can't get credit. Part of the problem in Elkhart, that I heard about today, was the fact that--this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch of RV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can't get the loan. Now, the businesses also can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit markets is, I think, step number two.Step number three is going to be housing: Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, the Federal Government doesn't have complete control over that, but if our plan is effective, working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure, and we can start stabilizing housing values over time. And the most--the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I've said, this is an unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficult year--and this year is going to be a difficult year--that businesses start investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, in fact, there's money to be made out there, customers or consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they start making purchases again. And if we get things right, then starting next year we can start seeing some significant improvement.Ed Henry. Where's Ed, CNN [Cable News Network]? There he is.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": " How do you respond to the criticism that you want gas prices to go higher to encourage a shift to renewable fuels [SEP] Ed, just from a political perspective, do you think the President of the United States going into reelection wants gas prices to go up higher? [] Is that--is there anybody here who thinks that makes a lot of sense?Look, here's the bottom line with respect to gas prices. I want gas prices lower because they hurt families. Because I meet folks every day who have to drive a long way to get to work, and them filling up this gas tank gets more and more painful, and it's a tax out of their pocketbooks, out of their paychecks, and a lot of folks are already operating on the margins right now.And it's not good for the overall economy, because when gas prices go up, consumer spending oftentimes pulls back. And we're in the midst right now of a recovery that is starting to build up steam, and we don't want to reverse it.What I have also said about gas prices is that there is no silver bullet and the only way we're going to solve this problem over the medium and long term is with an all-of-the-above strategy that says we're going to increase production, which has happened; we are going to make sure that we are conserving energy--that's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, which will save consumers about $1.7 trillion and take about 12 billion barrels of oil offline, which will help to reduce prices; and we're going develop clean energy technologies that allow us to continue to use less oil.And we've made progress. I mean, the good news is, 2010, first time in a decade that our oil imports were actually below 50 percent, and they have kept on going down. And we're going to keep on looking at every strategy we can to, yes, reduce the amount of oil that we use, while maintaining our living standards and maintaining our productivity and maintaining our economic growth, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that consumers aren't hurt by it.Now, there are some short-term steps that we're looking at with respect to--for example, there are certain potential bottlenecks in refineries around the country that we've been concerned about. We're concerned about what's happening in terms of production around the world. It's not just what's happening in the Gulf. You've had, for example, in Sudan, some oil that's been taken offline that's helping to restrict supply.So we're going to look at a whole range of measures, including, by the way, making sure that my Attorney General is paying attention to potential speculation in the oil markets. We--I've asked him to reconstitute a Task Force that's examining that.But we go through this every year. We've gone through this for 30 years. And if we are going to be competitive, successful, and make sure families are protected over the long term, then we've got to make sure that we've got a set of options that reduce our overall dependence on oil.And with respect to Israel, I am not the first President who has been unable, because of a whole range of issues, not to visit Israel as President in their first term. I visited Israel twice as Senator, once right before I became President. The measure of my commitment to Israel is not measured by a single visit. The measure of my commitment to Israel is seen in the actions that I've taken as President of the United States. And it is indisputable that I've had Israel's back over the last 3 years.Aamer Madhani [USA Today].Radio Talk Show Host Rush Limbaugh/", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": " Are you still confident that you'll see that kind of economic growth this year? [SEP] No, we're going to have tremendously low unemployment. We're setting records on that one. In fact, the administration has the—as you know, the lowest average unemployment of any administration in history. Our numbers are very low, very good—3.5, 3.6. But you can't really see what this does in terms of GDP.It could affect it, but that's irrelevant compared to what we're talking about. We want to make sure it's safe. Safety, number one.But this would have, you know, an impact on GDP. But we're still very, very—we're doing great. But this will—just like—I'll tell you what has a big impact: Boeing has a big impact. How did that happen? A year ago, all of a sudden, that happened. I think that took away a half a point to a point, even. You know, it's a massive company. I think Boeing—we had the General Motors strike; that was a big impact on GDP.And of course, we're paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the Fed. I'm not happy with what that is, because he's kept interest rates. President Obama didn't have near the numbers. And yet, if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We're paying interest. Now, it's more conservative. And frankly, people that put their money away are now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything.But I think, you know, we're the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates—meaning, they're literally getting paid when they put out money. I mean, they borrow money, and they get paid when it gets paid back. Who ever heard of this before? It's a first. But we don't do that.So I totally disagree with our Fed. I think our Fed has made a terrible mistake, and it would have made a big difference, as good as we've done, even without the 2,000 points. And we started off at 16,000, and we'll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody has seen before. But we're doing well. But we have to watch—we're doing well, anyway, in other words, even despite the 2,000 points. It sounds like a lot, and it's a lot. But it's nothing—it's very little compared to what we've gone up.But we'll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by General Motors. We've been hurt by Boeing. And we've hurt by—we've been hurt, in my opinion, very badly, by our own Federal Reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar.

Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of— in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people—nations in our alliance—to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this—of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq.

It's getting better.Look, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.But one of the things that I think is something that—one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day—and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him—a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to—excuse me, Governor Sununu—when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.Here's what he said: They were all, for the most—quote—They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do, Sununu said.He went on to say, It bothered me that they were okay with that. And then he goes on to say, I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back—if we win the White House back. Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018? And then, he said—how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.And so the problem here is that I think what happens—what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.Remember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that—you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when—that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole—I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.And I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that. And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.And one of the things that I remember saying—and I'll end this—I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act—I said, You ought to take a victory lap. And he said, There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.As a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.And so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.You know, one of the things that I remember—and I'll end this with—I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said—and when he would endorse me—and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access—access—to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that.

So the position of this administration is that the best way to meet with a leader like Asad or people from is in the larger context of trying to get the global community to help change his behavior. But sending delegations hasn't worked. It's just simply been counterproductive.Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].", "label": "Deflection"}

Some of the tests—because it is massive volume—it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick; they're 5 minutes and 15-minute tests. And those are, frankly, the ones that I prefer.But we're doing massive numbers, and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now which give you a 15-minute and a 5-minute test. So we'll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They're also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible. But those numbers will be coming down. I agree.

{"sentence": "In your discussions with the Kuwaitis today, have you discussed where they stand this week as we go into the U.N., as the United States tries to extend sanctions on Iran? [SEP] Well, they just left my office, as you know, the Oval Office. And we had a very good meeting with the Amir, and I think we understand each other very well. They're very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the Middle East. They are so excited that we signed the first two countries, and I think they'll end up fairly quickly being a part of it.I have, I would say, seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working very easily, very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. And not only is it happening, it's happening rather easily. We discussed that very briefly, because that's an easy one. Believe it or not, that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that's coming together very nicely.But we are talking to them and others about various aspects of the Middle East. The Middle East is straightening out with all this happening. You know, we've brought a lot of our troops back. A lot of them are coming back in the very near future.We're out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil. And we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we're out of Syria. We took them off the border between Syria and Turkey. We had a lot of troops on the border. Ultimately, we got it down to 50, and I thought they were in great danger when you have two armies sitting there looking to fight, and you have 50 people in the middle. I don't care who you are, even if you're the U.S., those 50 people are in great danger. We took them out.But we had a lot of troops on the border, and we took them out. I said, Look, they've been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that, under different names, and they can continue to do that. That's not for us; we're guarding our own borders. We're doing very well on our southern border, as an example.So we're out of Syria, except we kept the oil, and we'll make a determination. We'll probably be dealing with the Kurds and the oil and see what it all ends up. But we'll be out.And very importantly, we're down to very few soldiers in Iraq, and we're down—we'll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4,000—less than 4,000 in Afghanistan. And then we'll make that final determination a little bit later on.We're dealing very well with the Taliban. They're very tough, they're very smart, they're very sharp. But you know, it's been 19 years, and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness. And we really served as a police force, because if we wanted to do what we had to do, we would have fought a lot differently than they have over the 19 years. They didn't fight it properly. They were police, okay? They're not police; they're soldiers. So there's a difference. The police—nobody has more respect for police than I do, but they have to do their own policing.So we're having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It's been public. And—but we'll be down to—very shortly, we'll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. And so we'll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen—certain things have to be fulfilled. But 19 years is a long time, 8,000 miles away. Nineteen years is a long time.And the Middle East—the whole Middle East equation, if you look at what's happened, if you've looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made, including the deal that was made—I mean, take a look at what happened with Iran. Had that deal stayed and had I not broken that deal, you could have never done the deal that I'm doing now where all the countries are pouring in.And I had two calls this morning with countries; they want to know, When can we go into the deal? They want to go. It's not that we're giving them anything. They want security, they want peace, and they're really tired of fighting. It's incredible. They're tired of fighting. They've been fighting for so many years. They're tired of fighting. Thank you very much.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Where do you stand on Iraq and your domestic debate on Iraq? [SEP] Yes. I don't—you know, quagmire is an interesting word. If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny, you'd be saying, God, I love freedom. Because that's what's happened. And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom. But freedom is happening in Iraq, and we're making progress.And I can't thank the President enough for sending his Foreign Minister to Baghdad. It was a clear message that freedom matters, that when people are struggling to live in freedom, that those of us who have the comfort of a free society ought to help them.We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands. I reminded a TV reporter—I don't know if the person is here or not— but I said, I just want to remind you that 1441 was supported by France and the United States, which clearly said to the dictator, you will disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. Now, I'm the kind of person that when somebody says something, I take them for their word.Having said that, we had a difference of opinion. But I don't sense any difference of opinion now that a struggling democracy wants help from those of us who live in the comfort of free societies. And, Mr. President, the strong gesture of sending your Foreign Minister there wasn't a message to the United States, because we're good friends; it was message to the Iraqi citizens that said: We hear your cries for freedom; we want you to succeed, because one of the lessons of history is, free societies yield peace.And so I appreciate your leadership on that issue, and I want to thank your Foreign Minister for—I don't see your Foreign Minister. Look, the guy was here. [] Oh, there he is, yes, next to—look, the President was blocking—next to Madam Rice. Anyway, thank you, sir. Allow me to give you two answers in one. On , yes, we're worried about the situation. It's worrisome, and we need to have elections as swiftly as possible. You cannot combat extremism using the same methods as extremists, and it is very important, it is of the essence that organize elections. I, like President Bush, I wish this to take place as speedily as possible.Let me remind you that this is a country of 150 million inhabitants who happens to have nuclear weapons. This is very important for us that one day we shouldn't wake up with a government, an administration in which is in the hands of the extremists. And we should, each and every one of us, think about this, of the principles, the values that we uphold and that we defend and we must continue to uphold. And then there's the complexity, as it were, in the field. That's why it's important to convene election, call elections.Now, on Iraq, Bernard Kouchner's trip to Iraq was very successful. What does France want? A united Iraq. No one—no, it is in no one's interest to see Iraq dismantled. We want a democratic Iraq. We want a diverse Iraq, where each component element of Iraqi society has learned to live with others; an Iraq which is—which can administer and govern itself and that has the means of ensuring the peace and security of every one of its citizens. And that is exactly Bernard Kouchner's message when he went to Iraq. And this is in the interest of one and all that it be thus, and that position is the position I will defend until the end.

{"sentence": " Are you willing to pull out most combat forces by early 2008, unless there's unexpected circumstances? [SEP] The thing I liked about the Baker-Hamilton report is it discussed the way forward in Iraq. And I believe we need a new approach. And that's why I've tasked the Pentagon to analyze the way forward. That's why Prime Minister Blair is here to talk about the way forward, so we can achieve the objective, which is an Iraq which can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself and be an ally in the war on terror.And the Baker-Hamilton report did some very interesting things. First, it shows that Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an—to come up with a strategy to achieve an objective, something the American people don't think is possible to happen. In other words, they've seen elections, and they saw all the bitterness and finger-pointing and name-calling and wonder whether or not we can work together on this important cause. And I believe we can, and the Baker-Hamilton commission showed it's possible for people of good will to sit down at the table and design a way forward.And so that's why I'm sitting down with the Members of Congress, to say to both Republicans and Democrats, This is an important cause. It's important for our security. It's important to help lay the foundations for peace, and I want to hear your ideas. And I thought the report did a good job of showing what is possible. The Congress isn't going to accept every recommendation in the report, and neither will the administration, but there's a lot of very important things in the report that we ought to seriously consider.And as the Prime Minister talked about, there's three aspects to the report. One is, how do we empower the Maliki Government so that the Maliki Government—the elected Government of the Iraqis—can help with the economy, can help secure peace, can do hard work necessary to achieve stability and to achieve the objective?It talked about the regional—the countries in the region and the responsibilities of the region to help this Iraqi Government. And the idea of having an international group is an interesting idea. We've already got the compact, and I think the Baker-Hamilton report suggests that we broaden the Compact beyond just economic measures.But one thing is for certain: When people—if people come to the table to discuss Iraq, they need to come understanding their responsibilities to not fund terrorists, to help this young democracy survive, to help with the economics of the country. And if people are not committed, if Syria and Iran is not committed to that concept, then they shouldn't bother to show up.Thirdly, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is an—is important to have—is important to be solved. I'm committed to a two-state solution. I believe it is in Israel's interest and the Palestinian people's interest to have two states living side by side for peace. And the Prime Minister shares that goal, and he is willing to take time to go over and help remove obstacles toward achieving that goal.And there are two notable obstacles. One is the prisoner, and secondly, is for there to be a unity government that recognizes the principles of the Quartet, with which Israel can negotiate. And we want to help.And so I view this as a very important way forward, with important concepts. And the American people expect us to come up with a new strategy to achieve the objective which I've been talking about and which is laid out in the Baker-Hamilton report. Look, I think the analysis of the situation is not really in dispute. The question is, how do we find the right way forward? And what we've got at the moment is something that is at one level very simple to describe but at another level very profound and difficult to deal with, and that is that the outside extremists are linking up with internal extremists, basically to create the circumstances of sectarianism, where it's very, very difficult then for democracy and ordinary institutions to function.And I think the Baker-Hamilton report allows us to—as the situation has evolved in Iraq—to evolve our strategy in order to meet it in the ways that I've just described. But I think we've got to be very, very clear about this: It will require everybody to face up to their responsibilities—us, of course, because we are principal actors in this, but also the Iraqi Government. They've got to be prepared to make the moves necessary—full governance, full capability, reconciliation, and full help and security—and we will be there to support them.But then there's responsibilities, as the President was saying a moment or two ago, on the region and the neighbors. And let me come directly to the Iran and Syria point. The issue for me is not a question of being unwilling to sit down with people or not, but the basis upon which we discuss Iraq has got to be clear, and it's got to be a basis where we are all standing up for the right principles, which are now endorsed in the United Nations resolutions, in respect of Iraq. In other words, you support the democratic elected Government; you do not support sectarians; and you do not support, arm, or finance terrorists.Now, the very reason we have problems in parts of Iraq—and we know this very well down in the south of Iraq—is that Iran, for example, has been doing that. It's been basically arming, financing, supporting terrorism. So we've got to be clear the basis upon which we take this forward. And as I say, it's got to be on the basis of people accepting their responsibilities.And finally, in relation to what the President was just saying a moment or two ago on Israel and Palestine, I mean, I think that one thing that is very clear is that the old Middle East had within it the origins of all the problems we see. I mean, this terrorist problem that we faced in the last few years, it didn't originate, I'm afraid, a few years ago. It's been building up over decades. It's come out of a series of states of oppression, of warped ideology based on a perverted view of the faith of Islam. This has been building up for a long period of time, and it has basically come out of the Middle East.Now my view in the end is that you go back to the origins of this and say, well, how do we resolve it? And the only way we resolve it is by having the right vision and then the practical measures to achieve it.Now I think the vision is absolutely correct. What we've got to do now—and this is exactly why the President is talking about the way forward—is that we've got to get the right way forward—this is where Baker-Hamilton helped—in order that we have the practical policy that bolsters and gives effect to the vision, because the vision is the right vision. You leave a Middle East in which the Israel-Palestine issue is not solved, in which there's no moves towards democracy, in which Iraq goes back in its old state, in which the Iranian people have no chance to express themselves, maybe not in the months or 1 year, 2 years, but you'll have the same problem. You know, the reason we are faced with this issue is because in the end, everything that happened in that region erupted, in fact, on the streets of New York. But it—the origins of this went way, way back before that.And so it is—there's a tendency, I think, sometimes, to see this as a battle between the idealists on the one hand and the realists on the other. In my view, the only modern form of realism is one that has ideals at the center of it.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "How do you assure U.S. troops that there is an end coming to this mission? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think it's important, Leo, to remember the timeline for a withdrawal down to a Embassy-centered presence, a normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016. So that hasn't changed. Our transition out of a combat role has not changed.Now, I am the first to say that as long as our men and women in uniform are serving in Afghanistan, there are risks involved. It's a dangerous place. Casualties have come down precipitously as we've engaged in the drawdown. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed in Afghanistan. That has occurred precisely because we're not in a combat role. And I think it is worth noting the significant casualties that the Afghan security services have incurred. As we've drawn down, they've stood up, and they're fighting. And they're fighting with courage and tenacity, and they're getting better month by month. But you can't minimize the sacrifices that our military families make. It means some folks are going to be rotating back into Afghanistan for a few extra months relative to what otherwise would have been the case. We're essentially moving the drawdown pace over to the right for several months, in part to compensate for the lengthy period it took for Government formation; in part because we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to help Afghan security forces succeed so we don't have to go back, so we don't have to respond in an emergency because counterterrorist—or because terrorist activities are being launched out of Afghanistan.We're on the path to do that, and it was my assessment as Commander in Chief that it made sense for us to provide a few extra months for us to be able to help on things like logistics, making sure that equipment is not just in place, but it's also used properly; that the training and advising and strategic input that's been provided continues through this fighting season, in part so that President Karzai [Ghani]*, who has taken on the mantle of Commander in Chief in a way that we have not seen in the past from an Afghan President, can do a serious review and can assess here is where our strengths are, here's where our weaknesses are, and we can proceed with more effective joint planning going forward.So the bottom line is our men and women in uniform make enormous sacrifices. Their families do too; they serve alongside them. This will mean that there are going to be some of our folks who are in Afghanistan under the new schedule who would have been home. But it is important to keep in perspective, first of all, that we've gone down from 100,000 down to under 10,000; that they are not on the front lines because they're not in a combat role. We are doing all that we can do to make sure that force protection is a priority for those who are in Afghanistan. And the date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change.But it is my judgment, it's the judgment of General Campbell and others who are on the ground, that providing this additional timeframe during this fighting season for us to be able to help the Afghan security forces succeed is well worth it. And in that sense, once again, we are asking our men and women in uniform to fight on behalf of our freedom and on behalf of a more orderly world.It does, perhaps, raise one thought, which is, right now there's a debate going up on Capitol Hill about budgets. This would be a good time for my friends up on Capitol Hill, including on the other side of the aisle, to take a look at their budgets. If we're holding both our defense and nondefense budgets to 2006 levels, it's a lot harder for us to do the job that we need to do not only on the national security side, but also here at home, making sure that when our men and women come home, and when they potentially go into civilian life, that they've got a strong economy, that their kids have good schools, that they can send their kids to college, that they get the veterans benefits that they have so richly earned and deserve. That would be a good way for us to express the thanks for the sacrifices they consistently make. I met yesterday the widow of General Greene. She would like the memory of her husband to be preserved by a sustainable Afghanistan that is secure. The 2,215 Americans that have died must not die in vain. They must leave behind a legacy of a stable Afghanistan. And it's that preservation of those gains that I think inspires the American service men and women to obey the call of their commander, the order of their commanders.Second, we have taken them out of the harm's way. As the President mentioned, for the past 100 days, because the combat role has ended, the exposure, the number of casualties is really down. There isn't—my most horrible reading of the day is my first, middle-of-the-day, and end-of-the-day security reports where I see the casualties of the Afghan figures. But thank God they're no longer American or European casualties.John Campbell is making sure that they remain in support role. Their train, advise, assist role has risks, but they're nowhere comparable to combat role. And end of that combat role is very significant to this. And again, the institutional gains that would be achieved through the train, advise, and assist role is what will guarantee that the investments of the last 14 years pay off in terms of gains that would ensure.Last point: Afghanistan is the front line. Because of American engagement in Afghanistan, there have not been attacks on mainland United States. But let's not forget that fortresses cannot be built around countries or continents. We are living in an interconnected world, and our security is joined together./U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/Afghan Security Forces", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Possibility of court battle over actions on immigration extending late into the term, what can be done for the people affected by the program and now in limbo, and the view on the possibility of ending the term without accomplishing goals on immigration. [SEP] On Ukraine and Russia and Minsk, there is strong consensus that we need to keep pushing Russia to abide by the terms of the Minsk agreement; we need to continue to support and encourage Ukraine to meet its obligations under Minsk; that until that's completed, sanctions remain in place.There was discussion about additional steps that we might need to take if Russia, working through separatists, doubled down on aggression inside of Ukraine. We—those discussions are taking place at a technical level, not yet at a political level, because I think the first goal here going into a European Council meeting that's coming up is just rolling over the existing sanctions. But I think at a technical level, we want to be prepared.Our hope is, is that we don't have to take additional steps because the Minsk agreement is met. And I want to give enormous credit to Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, who have shown extraordinary stick-to-itiveness and patience in trying to get that done.Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin. He's got to make a decision: Does he continue to wreck his country's economy and continue Russia's isolation in pursuit of a wrongheaded desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire, or does he recognize that Russia's greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?And as I mentioned earlier, the costs that the Russian people are bearing are severe. That's being felt. It may not always be understood why they're suffering, because of state media inside of Russia and propaganda coming out of state media in Russia and to Russian speakers. But the truth of the matter is, is that the Russian people would greatly benefit. And ironically, one of the rationales that Mr. Putin provided for his incursions into Ukraine was to protect Russian speakers there. Well, Russian speakers inside of Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Their economy has collapsed. Their lives are disordered. Many of them are displaced. Their homes may have been destroyed. They're suffering. And the best way for them to stop suffering is if the Minsk agreement is fully implemented.Christi—oh, immigration. With respect to immigration, obviously, I'm frustrated by a district court ruling that now is wending its way through the appeals process. We are being as aggressive as we can legally to, first and foremost, appeal that ruling, and then to implement those elements of immigration executive actions that were not challenged in court.But obviously, the centerpiece, one of the key provisions for me was being able to get folks who are undocumented to go through a background check—criminal background check—pay back taxes, and then have a legal status. And that requires an entire administrative apparatus and us getting them to apply and come clean.I made a decision, which I think is the right one, that we should not accept applications until the legal status of this is clarified. I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security's legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we're doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we're doing is lawful.But the United States is a government of laws and separations of power, and when a—even if it's a individual district court judge who's making this determination, we've got to go through the process to challenge it. And until we get clarity there, I don't want to bring people in, have them apply and jump through a lot of hoops, only to have it deferred and delayed further.Of course, there's one really great way to solve this problem, and that would be Congress going ahead and acting, which would obviate the need for executive actions. The majority of the American people, I think, still want to see that happen. I suspect it will be a major topic of the next Presidential campaign.And so we will continue to push as hard as we can on all fronts to fix a broken immigration system. Administratively, we'll be prepared if and when we get the kind of ruling that I think we should have gotten in the first place about our authorities to go ahead and implement. But ultimately, this has never fully replaced the need for Congress to act. And my hope is, is that after a number of the other issues that we're working on currently get cleared, that there—some quiet conversations start up—back up again, particularly in the Republican Party, about the shortsighted approach that they're taking when it comes to immigration.Okay.

{"sentence": "How would you advise Mr. Trump's advisers to help him be effective when he deals with Vladimir Putin? [SEP] Well, a couple of things. Number one, I think it is in America's interests and the world's interests that we have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my Presidency. Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community and tried to work with the President and the Government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways.I think it's fair to say that after President Putin came back into the Presidency that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seemed to be premised on the idea that whatever America is trying to do must be bad for Russia and so we want to try and counteract whatever they do, that return to an adversarial spirit that, I think, existed during the cold war has made the relationship more difficult. And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine.The reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues. It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon, by force, by Russia. That wasn't our judgment, that was the judgment of the entire international community. And Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international law and international norms.What I've said to the Russians is, as soon as you stop doing that, the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve not only American interests, but also the interests of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don't confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.On nuclear issues, in my first term, we negotiated the START II Treaty, and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stockpiles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further. I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there is—remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce our stockpiles. And part of the reason we've been successful on our nonproliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda is because we were leading by example.I hope that continues. But I think it's important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big countries don't go around and invade and bully smaller countries. I've said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are, historically, bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. But Ukraine is an independent country.And this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around the world in preserving basic norms and values, whether it's advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women's rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press.The United States has not always been perfect in this regard. There are times where we, by necessity, are dealing with allies or friends or partners who, themselves, are not meeting the standards that we would like to see met when it comes to international rules and norms. But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting—in the United Nations, in the G-20, in the G-7—the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues. And it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues, because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.Kevin Corke [Fox News].", "label": "General"}

[SEP] Well, I think that I never have a green light. I'm bound by the Constitution; I'm bound by separation of powers. There are some things we can't do.Congress has the power of the purse, for example. I would love to fund a large infrastructure proposal right now that would put millions of people to work and boost our GDP. We know we've got roads and bridges and airports and electrical grids that need to be rebuilt. But without the cooperation of Congress, what I can do is speed up the permitting process, for example. I can make sure that we're working with the private sector to see if we can channel investment into much-needed projects. But ultimately, Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I don't have a green light.What I am consistently going to do is, wherever I have the legal authorities to make progress on behalf of middle class Americans and folks working to get into the middle class, whether it's by making sure that Federal contractors are paying a fair wage to their workers, making sure that women have the opportunity to make sure that they're getting paid the same as men for doing the same job, where I have the capacity to expand some of the student loan programs that we've already put in place so that repayments are a little more affordable for college graduates—I'm going to take—I'm going to seize those opportunities. And that's what I think the American people expect me to do.My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but it's going to be longer lasting. And when you look at, for example, congressional inaction, and in particular, the inaction on the part of House Republicans, when it comes to immigration reform, now, here's an area where, as I've said before, not only the American people want to see action, not only is there 80 percent overlap between what Republicans say they want and Democrats say they want, we actually passed a bill out of the Senate that was bipartisan.And in those circumstances, what the American people expect is that, despite the differences between the parties, there should at least be the capacity to move forward on things we agree on. And that's not what we're seeing right now. So in the face of that kind of dysfunction, what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress.And we're going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you, the American people don't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done. Even as we take these executive actions, I'm going to continue to reach out to Democrats and Republicans—to the Speaker, to the leadership on both sides and in both Chambers—to try to come up with formulas where we can make progress, even if it's incremental.", "label": "Explicit"}

And so the question is, how can we have constructive dialog with our neighbors as to how to spread the benefits of investment?I also am reminding people that the United States taxpayer is most generous when it comes to bilateral aid. Since I've been the President, we've doubled the amount of annual bilateral aid to Latin America from $800 million a year to $1.6 billion a year. And most of the money is aimed at social justice programs, programs like education and health care.I also know full well that—and I saw this firsthand yesterday in Sao Paulo—that many American NGOs and faith-based groups and individuals express their concern about the plight of the poor through programs and activities all aimed at giving people a chance. Yesterday in Sao Paulo, we went to a pretty wealthy neighborhood, but it was surrounded by a . And there we found in the midst of hopelessness, there was a little center of love. And some of the program money had been raised as a result of concerts given in the United States, where citizens, average citizens, contribute to make sure this program remain viable.And so the trip is a—it's a statement of the desire to work together with people in our neighborhood. I've been to Central and South America a lot since I've been the President, because I fully understand a prosperous and peaceful neighborhood is in the interest of the United States of America.I would call our diplomacy quiet and effective diplomacy—diplomacy all aimed at helping people, aimed at elevating the human condition, aimed at expressing the great compassion of the American people.And, Mr. President, I appreciate you giving me a chance to come and visit with you, have a dialog about how we can advance our interests and the interests of our neighborhood. Concerning your question, the strategy for international insertion of Uruguay is quite well defined and quite clear. We are in favor of an open integration process; we are strongly in favor of the regional process. We are where we are, and we don't want to leave this place. And the trade we have and the cultural, historical relationships that we have with our brethren countries in the region are very solid, very strong. But we don't want a closed integration process, but an open integration process.This MERCOSUR should be able to integrate to other blocks or other countries of the world, and also each of the members of this process—for example, Uruguay— might be able to exercise its sovereign right of developing bilateral relations with other integration processes or other countries.

I think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith, corner of this country, because that's America's strength. When we have everybody getting a chance and everybody is on the field, we end up being better.I think I've used this analogy before. We killed it in the Olympics in Brazil. And Michelle and I, we always have our—the Olympic team here. And it's a lot of fun, first of all, just because anytime you're meeting somebody who is the best at anything—[]—it's impressive. And these mostly very young people are all just so healthy looking, and they just beam and exude fitness and health. And so we have a great time talking to them.But they are of all shapes, sizes, colors: the genetic diversity that is on display is remarkable. And if you look at a Simone Biles, and then you look at a Michael Phelps, they're completely different. And it's precisely because of those differences that we've got people here who can excel at any sport.And by the way, more than half of our medals came from women. And the reason is, is because we had the foresight several decades ago, with something called Title IX, to make sure that women got opportunities in sports, which is why our women compete better, because they have more opportunities than folks in other countries.So I use that as a metaphor. And if in fact we continue to keep opportunity open to everybody, then, yes, we're going to have a woman President, we're going to have a Latino President, and we'll have a Jewish President, a Hindu President. Who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed-up Presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them. [] And that's fine.Now, what do I worry about? I obviously spent a lot of time on this, April, at my Farewell Address on Tuesday, so I won't go through the whole list. I worry about inequality, because I think that if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast, and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans, and I—not just along racial lines. I mean, there are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the President-elect because they feel forgotten and disenfranchised. They feel as if they're being looked down on. They feel as if their kids aren't going to have the same opportunities as they did.And you don't want to have an America in which a handful—a very small sliver of people are doing really well and everybody else is fighting for scraps, as I said last week. Because that's oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified, because people think, well, the only way I'm going to get ahead is if I make sure somebody else gets less, somebody who doesn't look like me or doesn't worship at the same place I do. That's not a good recipe for our democracy.I worry about, as I said in response to a previous question, making sure that the basic machinery of our democracy works better. We are the only country in the advanced world that makes it harder to vote rather than easier.

But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious—it's not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala—I mean, in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying: I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun? Let's go. That's not how it happens. People don't want to leave.When my great-grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn't want to leave. But they had no choice. So you've got—we can't—I can't guarantee we're going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it's much more heart wrenching—and it is—to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children—70 percent—are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn't make it—that doesn't make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night—and there's some; that's true. That's why we've got to act.And yesterday I asked my team—both the Director of the two agencies, as well as others—I asked them what would they, in fact—and I asked their opinion because they're the experts—but I said, Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.But there's no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can't be made in the first 48 hours and begin.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": " President Bush, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki says that talks on a status of forces agreement are at an impasse, or a dead end—not dead, but in trouble. How do you break this impasse, and are the conditions that the United States have set forward in support so far nonnegotiable? [SEP] Olivier, if I were a betting man, we'll reach an agreement with the Iraqis. And it's—you know, of course we're there at their invitation; this is a sovereign nation. And therefore, we're working hard with the elected Government of Iraq about, you know, U.S. presence and coalition presence in a way that the elected Government is comfortable.And it's interesting to be in—working with a democracy where, you know, people are trying to prepare the ground to get something passed through Parliament, for example, or the free press is vibrant. But we're going to work hard to accommodate their desires. It's their country.And at the same time, we believe that a strategic relationship with Iraq is important. It's important for Iraq; it's important for the United States; it's important for the region. And I repeat to you that whatever we agreed to, it will not commit future Presidents to troop levels, nor will it establish permanent bases.Anyway, we'll see how it goes. And thanks for the question in English. [] Well, the Americans and the French have had a privileged relationship for two centuries now. I mean, when the United States of America was born, France made a choice. It was not a European choice, because we chose to side with the Americans or the United States of America as opposed to Britain at the time. And in two World Wars, we've been together. We share the same values.So yes, it is a privileged relationship, but it's not privileged since I came to be elected; it's been privileged for two centuries now. You can't neglect that. Now, through this—throughout that, we have had ups and downs—hiccups—because two peoples— I'm talking about the French and the American peoples—that actually resemble one another. We express our feelings. The American people can be heard, and likewise for the French people. We have to be careful about this. We have to be mindful of this when we talk to one another in our relations.I have always seen American leaders— and thank you to President Bush—for accepting European originality and independence and, of course, French originality and independence. And I've always noted that we can talk very frankly when we had points of disagreement. But we have to do so in—as allies and as friends, and be mindful of not hurting one another. We can agree on an issue, on the substance of issue, but we don't have to say so in an unpleasant manner. It so happens that today we have a lot of areas of convergence. But yes, maybe on such and such an issue, we don't totally agree, but it doesn't in any way undermine the basis of what I have to say, which is that the Americans are our friends and our allies. They know they can count on us.Might I add that it seems to me that the more you trust somebody, the more trust there is on both sides of the Atlantic, the more leeway we have. We don't ask the United States to apologize to us because they have their own vision of their strategic interests, and they don't ask us to apologize for the fact that we are defending our own strategic interests, precisely because the relationship is a strong one; it is a calm one. And when a relationship is that strong, you accept one's divergences or differences. And that is my whole point. You've got to understand, if you're in a strong relationship, then you have more room for freedom, more room for maneuver. That's what this is all about.Perhaps one last question? Oh.

{"sentence": " Why are we now seeing an increase in suspicion and resentment of Islam, especially considering efforts to improve relations with the Muslim world? [SEP] I think that at a time when the country is anxious generally and going through a tough time, then fears can surface, suspicions, divisions can surface in a society. And so I think that plays a role in it.One of the things that I most admired about President Bush was after 9/11, him being crystal clear about the fact that we were not at war with Islam. We were at war with terrorists and murderers who had perverted Islam, had stolen its banner to carry out their outrageous acts. And I was so proud of the country rallying around that idea, that notion that we are not going to be divided by religion, we're not going to be divided by ethnicity. We are all Americans. We stand together against those who would try to do us harm.And that's what we've done over the last 9 years. And we should take great pride in that. And I think it is absolutely important now for the overwhelming majority of the American people to hang on to that thing that is best in us, a belief in religious tolerance, clarity about who our enemies are. Our enemies are Al Qaida and their allies who are trying to kill us, but have killed more Muslims than just about anybody on Earth. We have to make sure that we don't start turning on each other.And I will do everything that I can as long as I am President of the United States to remind the American people that we are one Nation under God, and we may call that God different names, but we remain one Nation. And as somebody who relies heavily on my Christian faith in my job, I understand the passions that religious faith can raise. But I'm also respectful that people of different faiths can practice their religion, even if they don't subscribe to the exact same notions that I do, and that they are still good people and they are my neighbors and they are my friends and they are fighting alongside us in our battles.And I want to make sure that this country retains that sense of purpose.

And to this end, as you know, I've committed 3,200—3,500 additional marines to send a clear signal that we're willing to do our part.I was very pleased to listen to the comments of President Sarkozy, where he indicated his willingness to increase troop presence. Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of— in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people—nations in our alliance—to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this—of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq. So the question nations have to ask: Is it worth it? And my answer is, absolutely, it's worth it—and so is the President—it's worth it for our own security, and it's worth it for the cause of peace. Thank you. Regarding Afghanistan, we have a main idea that any lack of success of the NATO in Afghanistan will diminish dramatically the credibility of our organization. And for the time being, the civilized world don't have alternatives to the security than NATO. We have to do everything what we can in order to make a success in our action in Afghanistan: granting democratic development of the country, economic development of the country, security of the country, and eliminating the terrorist risks which are generated by this region.

The G-7 explicitly agreed to call out human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong explicitly.Two, to coordinate a common strategy to deal with China nonmarket policies that undermine competition. They've agreed—and that's underway now—how to do that.Three, to take serious actions against forced labor in solar, agriculture, and the garment industries because that's where it's happening. And they've agreed we will do that.To launch—what I said earlier; I really feel very strongly—I proposed that we have a democratic alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative: the Build Back Better. And they've agreed to that, and that's underway as the details of that—we agreed that we'd put together a committee to do that and come up with that. And thirdly, that we are going to insist on a high-standards to be—for a climate-friendly, transparent alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. And—but, in the meantime, we're going to move forward.Look, I think it's always—let me put it this way: I know this is going sound somewhat prosaic, but I think we're in a contest, not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century.And I think how we act and whether we pull together as democracies is going to determine whether our grandkids look back 15 years from now and say, Did they step up? Are democracies as relevant and as powerful as they have been?And I walked away from the meeting with all my colleagues believing that they are convinced that that is correct now too. Not—I shouldn't say now. Not just because of me, but they believe that to be the case.And so I think you're going to see just straightforward dealing with China. And again, we're not looking—as I've told Xi Jinping myself, I'm not looking for conflict. Where we can cooperate, we'll cooperate. Where we disagree, I'm going to state it frankly, and we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent.For example, we talked about trade. It's one thing to talk about whether or not our agricultural policy makes sense.

{"sentence": " How will the U.S. help in pushing forward the agenda to transform the continent? [SEP] Thanks. I actually went to Africa on the first lap of my Presidency too. This is my second trip to the continent of Africa, and I've come to remind our fellow citizens that it is in our interest to help countries deal with curable diseases like malaria and difficult diseases like HIV/ AIDS; that it's in our interest to promote trade between the continent of Africa and the United States of America; that it's in our interest to provide education money so governments will educate children.And there's no better way of making that point than to be in Ghana, where people will get to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to be giving speeches in America, it's another thing to actually come to Ghana and meet different folks that are involved with making the—Ghana a better place.Secondly, first of all, Africa has changed since I've been the President, in a very positive way. It's not because of me; it's because of African leaders—I want you to know. But there was six regional conflicts when I became the President. Take Liberia, for example. It was a real issue and a real problem, and along with Nigeria and with John's advice, for example, we—I made some decisions, along with other leaders, that helped put in place the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. And I'm going there tomorrow to herald the successes she's done and to reaffirm our commitment that we'll help.In other words, conflict resolution has been taking place. And the United States hasn't tried to impose a will. We've just tried to be a useful partner, like in eastern Congo, for example, working with the Presidents of Rwanda and Congo and Burundi.Secondly, democracy is making progress across the continent of Africa. One reason why is because there are examples like John Kufuor for people to look at. I'm telling you, the guy is a respected person. People look at him, and they say, this is the kind of leader that we respect.And thirdly, our aid program has changed from one that basically said, here's your money, good luck, to one that said, in return for generosity, we expect there to be certain habits in place, like fighting corruption or investing in the education of children. I don't think that's too much to ask in return for U.S. taxpayers' money. It hasn't been asked in the past. This is a novel approach, interestingly enough. But I feel confident in asking nations to adhere to good principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders.I'm confident in the capacity of the leaders I have met—not every single leader— but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy—a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent.

{"sentence": " Do you think the political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of a tax on carbon? [SEP] As you know, Mark, we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing, faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting, faster than was predicted even 5 years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily—there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe.And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it.Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere. But we haven't done as much as we need to.So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can—what more can we do to make in—short-term progress in reducing carbons and then working through an education process that I think is necessary—a discussion, a conversation across the country—about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with.I don't know what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue, I also think there are regional differences. There's no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices. And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that.If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth, and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support.So you can expect that you'll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "Response to suggestions that German reliance on Russian gas limits Europe's options in responding to the crisis in Ukraine [SEP] Let me respond. First of all, we are looking at opportunities to make up for lost gas—LNG—from Russia. We're underway of trying to see what we can do to do that and dealing with our friends around the world, as well. We think we could make up a significant portion of it that would be lost.But you know, what everybody forgets here is, Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil. Russia relies—a significant part of Russia's budget—it's the only thing they really have to export. And if in fact it's cut off, then they're going to be hurt very badly as well. And it's of consequence to them as well. This is not just a one-way street.And so we are looking at what we could do to help compensate for loss of—immediate loss of gas in Europe if it occurs. And that's what we've been working on for some time now. I can confirm that we work closely with the United States of America, and Joe Biden and I are working closely together as well.We are prepared for all kinds of situation.

{"sentence": "Can the President assure the American people that none of the money went to support terrorism? [SEP] Okay. The—it's been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January, many months ago. There wasn't a secret. Right? We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn't some nefarious deal. And at the time, we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it's interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one.Point number two: We do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out.But those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world—even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families—families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom—defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't—we won't in the future, precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups.Point number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.John Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised—it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal—and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community—the country that was most opposed to this deal—that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [] Now, that would be a shock. [] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't. This worked.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].", "label": "Implicit"}

It's sick what he's doing.But the fact of the matter is, I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin.

Go back and read the speech he made. He talked about him—with needing to be another Peter the Great. He talked about the need for the people—that Kyiv is the motherload of Russian identity in the beginning, et cetera, et cetera. He's just miscalculated across the board.And so the question is, what is his decision—how does he get himself out of the circumstance he's in? I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I'm not going to do it on my own.Thank you.[.] Regarding your question and the preconditions or the conditions set by the Ukrainian President, I believe that what is important for all of us to look at is that as Ukraine is resisting, suffering from war crimes, attacks on their civilian infrastructure, leading counteroffensive, President Zelenskyy presented a 10-point peace plan.So we, I believe, very much need to continue to engage with him, because there is a genuine willingness, on behalf of Ukraine, to discuss these matters. And we acknowledge it, and we commend it.And, for a number of years, I was in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. And the latest—at the last meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, the only one—December 2019—at the time, I was with Chancellor Merkel. And I can tell you that I saw a President who was sincere in his willingness to talk and to negotiate.And since he was elected, until May, President Zelenskyy was very much willing to talk and negotiate. The one who wanted to go to war, to wage war was President Putin. And I could see it by myself, including when I visited Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of February.So it's only legitimate that President Zelenskyy sets some conditions to talk. We need to work on what could lead to a peace agreement, but it is for him to tell us when the time comes and what the choices of the Ukrainians are.So once this has been said, indeed, I will continue to talk to President Putin. And as a matter of fact, we talked about it this morning with President Biden, because we constantly, as well, tried to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results.So I will talk to him about security and safety of nuclear plants in the areas that are being claimed, including Zaporizhzhia, in particular. And over the past few months, we did some work on the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and there is some outstanding work ongoing, which is very important, by Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA. So we will continue.Thank you so much. Thanks, folks. All right.", "label": "Implicit"}

Additionally, does President Calderon think this situation helps achieve the unity he has always called for among Mexicans, particularly regarding the bill on energy in the Mexican Congress? [SEP] This kind of attitude can only be compared to the people who are making it. Congress is working normally. There is a responsible attitude on the part of most of the political parties represented therein. People from the PRI, the PAN, the Green Party, the New Alliance, other political parties are working firmly. And I simply deplore this attitude, which only impoverishes the image of those behind it and weakens even more the presence of Mexicans from parties as important as the PRD, which, aside from their own internal crisis, are losing their public image because of the activities of people who simply make them look ridiculous.I hope that our institutional life will be strengthened and that we strengthen dialogue and the capacity for talking among ourselves.This issue that you referred to is already in the hands of the authorities.

This wasn't like we went and we started talking about—as you know, right? We didn't just come in and start talking about these very complex subjects that have been going on for 70 years. We've been discussing this for months. And you know, once the rhetoric stopped, once they did a great thing—you know, North Korea did a great thing by going to the Olympics. Because the Olympics—and President Moon will tell you this—the Olympics was not exactly doing great. People didn't feel like being bombed out of the opening ceremonies. You know, they weren't exactly selling tickets. And as soon as the Chairman—Chairman Kim—said, Let's participate in the Olympics, it sold like wildfire and was a great success as an Olympics. It was a great success. He did a great thing.But since that time, pretty much since that time—because, as you know, a delegation came from South Korea who had just met with North Korea. They came to the White House. They told me lots of things, including the fact that they'd be willing to denuke. We have one of their great people here today. That they were willing to denuke.

{"sentence": " doesn't it blunt your push for deficit-neutral corporate tax reform? [SEP] Well, I continue to believe I'm right. [] So we're going to try again. I think what's different is everybody says now that they're really serious about the deficit. Well, if you're really serious about the deficit--not just spending, but you're serious about the deficit overall--then part of what you have to look at is unjustifiable spending through the Tax Code, through tax breaks that do not make us more competitive, do not create jobs here in the United States of America.And the two examples you cite, I think, most economists would look at and they'd say these aren't contributing to our long-term economic growth. And if they're not, why are we letting some folks pay lower taxes than other folks who are creating jobs here in the United States and are investing? Why are we not investing in the energy sources of the future, just the ones in the past, particularly if the energy sources of the past are highly profitable right now and don't need a tax break?So I think what may have changed is, if we are going to get serious about deficit reduction and debt reduction, then we've got to look at all the sources of deficit and debt. We can't be just trying to pick and choose and getting a hundred percent of our way.The same is true, by the way, for Democrats. I mean, there are some provisions in this budget that are hard for me to take. You've got cities around the country and States around the country that are having a tremendously difficult time trying to balance their own budgets because of fallen revenue. They've got greater demands because folks have lost their jobs; the housing market is still in a tough way in a lot of these places. And yet part of what this budget says is we're going to reduce community development block grants by 10 percent. That's not something I'd like to do. But--and if it had come up a year ago or 2 years ago, I would have said no. Under these new circumstances, I'm saying yes to that. And so my expectation is, is that everybody is going to have to make those same sorts of compromises.Now, with respect to corporate tax reform, the whole concept of corporate tax reform is to simplify, eliminate loopholes, treat everybody fairly. That is entirely consistent with saying, for example, that we shouldn't provide special treatment to the oil industry when they've been making huge profits and can afford to further invest in their companies without special tax breaks that are different from what somebody else gets.", "label": "Implicit"}

When I was Vice President, I spent the bulk of my 8 years basically in Europe and/or in Latin America. I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything—for example, with the—to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal—people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us—sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?People leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with—although I don't have much Republican support anymore—is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system? And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.I also believe—I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and—not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.So, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united—not united—a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our—under the last administration—the Obama-Biden administration.But so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have—when I call for a Summit of the Democracies—I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy—what is it that's going to allow us to generate—we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.We used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about America's backyard. It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that—of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.But the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.Yes.

Very few people, at that age—you can take 1 out of 10,000, probably, couldn't do it.Otto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life.

And I assured him we're working hard to make sure that they—people lived up to the Constitution, that modern Constitution voted on by the people that would honor people from different walks of life and different attitudes.We talked about a lot of other subjects. We talked about our attempts to help the people in Africa deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and hunger.

Now over 1,100,000 people are getting them, as a result of our initiative on HIV/AIDS, and that I'm going to double that commitment—or ask Congress to double the commitment from 15 billion to 30 billion.I talked to him about our malaria program, about how we intend to reduce malaria by 50 percent in certain countries, and that I'd continue to remind the world of our duty to work together to achieve a major goal, which is to try to eradicate malaria throughout Africa.And I talked to him about our attempts to feed the hungry, and I also reminded him that we've got poor people in our own neighborhood that need to be affected.He talked about immigration.

So it has to be tested. And I know that the Europeans are discussing at this point the final shape of their sanctions measures. It's my view that if you look at President Poroshenko's plan, it is going to take some time to implement. And as a consequence, for us to move forward based on what is currently happening on the ground with sanctions—while acknowledging that if in fact the elements of the plan that has been signed are implemented, then those sanctions could be lifted—is a more likely way for us to ensure that there's follow-through. But that's something that obviously we'll consult closely with our European partners to determine.I do want to point out, though, that the only reason that we're seeing this cease-fire at this moment is because of both the sanctions that have already been applied and the threat of further sanctions, which are having a real impact on the Russian economy and have isolated Russia in a way that we have not seen in a very long time.The path for Russia to rejoin the community of nations that respects international law is still there, and we encourage President Putin to take it. But the unity and the firmness that we've seen in the trans-Atlantic alliance in supporting Ukraine and applying sanctions has been, I think, a testimony to how seriously people take the basic principle that big countries can't just stomp on little countries or force them to change their policies and give up their sovereignty.So I'm very pleased with the kind of work that's been done throughout this crisis in Ukraine, and I think U.S. leadership has been critical throughout that process.With respect to the Rapid Response Forces and the readiness action plan that we've put forward, in Warsaw, I announced $1 billion in our initiative. A sizeable portion of that will be devoted to implementing various aspects of this readiness action plan.We've already increased obviously rotations of personnel in the Baltic States, for example. We have the air policing. We have the activities that are taking place in the Baltic and the Black Sea. But this allows us to supplement it. It allows us to coordinate it and integrate it further with additional contributions from other partners. And what it signifies is NATO's recognition that, in light of recent Russian actions as well as rhetoric, we want to make it crystal clear: We mean what we say when we're talking about our article 5 commitments.
