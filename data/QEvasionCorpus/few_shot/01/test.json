{"sentence": "Mr. President, did President Putin indicate any willingness for Assad to step down? And did you make progress with him or President Hu in stopping the bloodshed in Syria? [SEP] These were major topics in both meetings. The violence in Syria is out of control, civilians are being targeted, and Assad has lost legitimacy. Massacring citizens makes an orderly transition with Assad in power impossible. This transition isn't easy. Russia and China have been more resistant to applying pressure. We had a candid conversation. The U.S. isn't aligned with Russia and China, but they recognize the dangers of civil war and don't condone the massacres. They believe everyone would be better served if Syria had a mechanism for ceasing violence and creating a legitimate government. I've said we should work with the UN and Kofi Annan on a political transition. I hope we can present a pathway for resolving this conflict. Russia and China aren't signed on yet, but they recognize the situation is grave and doesn't serve their interests. We agree that helping the Syrian people find a resolution would benefit everyone. I don't see a scenario where Assad stays and violence is reduced. He didn't fulfill his side of the Annan plan. The international monitors had to leave. The opposition has engaged in violence, but the images from places like Homs were the direct result of the Syrian Government's decisions, and Assad is responsible.", "label": "Implicit"}

Also, your reaction to Mullah Mansur's death, Pakistan's concerns, a potential new Afghan offensive, and a more radical Taliban leader? [SEP] Regarding TPP, every trade agreement presents difficulties. Parties always seek a better deal. With multiple participants, scrutiny is intense. In an election year, some will try to gain political advantage.Nevertheless, I remain confident we will succeed because it is the right course of action. It benefits America, the region, and the world.This is the fastest-growing area globally. It represents a substantial market for the U.S. Most nations already sell to us with low tariffs. Conversely, tariffs are higher for U.S. products sold there. A deal eliminating 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in these markets is advantageous for American businesses and workers.Historically, trade agreements have been criticized for exposing our markets to nations with lower wages, inadequate labor practices, and lax environmental regulations. TPP mandates enforceable commitments to improve labor standards, empower workers, and address environmental concerns. This enables us to engage with countries like Vietnam and collaborate on these issues.I have yet to encounter a compelling argument that TPP will worsen our situation. We will demonstrably benefit. American workers and businesses will gain from TPP's passage. I am confident it will pass.The politics will be turbulent. This was true for the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements I inherited. But we achieved their passage. I am confident we will do so again, despite the challenges.Regarding currency manipulation, TPP incorporates transparency and reporting mechanisms to monitor it. Some advocate for enforceable provisions allowing us to impose tariffs if currency is significantly devalued. However, determining if devaluation is manipulation is difficult. Binding other nations on monetary policy would necessitate binding our Federal Reserve, which we will not do. We have strengthened provisions to address competitive devaluations.Finally, Mullah Mansur's death is confirmed. As Taliban leader, he targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, who were there to maintain a counterterrorism presence and train Afghan forces. This does not alter our strategy. We are not re-engaging in combat operations. Our role is to assist Afghanistan in securing itself.However, when a prominent leader consistently plans to harm U.S. personnel and resists peace negotiations, I must act to protect our people. That is the message we have conveyed.President Quang, allow me to address the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

And we will try to reduce differences in the spirit of constructiveness and understanding and paying attention to one another's legitimate interests.

Would you support such a thing? [SEP] It wouldn't bother me, other than the FBI, Jon, said that they really don't do that; that's not what they do. Now, they have done, supposedly, six background checks over the years, as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder. He's an incredible individual. Great intellect, great judge. Impeccable history in every way—in every way.I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this. This should have been brought to the fore. It should have been brought up long ago. And that's what you have hearings for. You don't wait until the hearing is over and then, all of a sudden, bring it up.When Senator Feinstein sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a long period of time—a long, long meeting—she had this letter. Why didn't she bring it up? Why didn't she bring it up then? Why didn't the Democrats bring it up then? Because they obstruct and because they resist. That's the name of their campaign against me.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Kenya, what specific steps will the U.S. undertake to assist in combating al-Shabaab? Do you still view Somalia as a viable counterterrorism model? Are you concerned about potential human rights violations by Kenyan authorities under the guise of counterterrorism? And for President Kenyatta, what additional assistance do you require from the U.S. to fight al-Shabaab, and are you satisfied with the current support level? Furthermore, could you both address the criticism surrounding the treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals in Kenya? [SEP] Well, this has been a subject of extensive discussion and concrete action that we're now implementing. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya, primarily addressing threats from al-Shabaab. Partly due to actions we've taken not only with Kenya, but also with AFRICOM, and the collective efforts of countries working together—Uganda, Ethiopia, and others—we have systematically reduced the territory controlled by al-Shabaab. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and weaken those networks operating here in East Africa. However, the problem is not solved. As is true globally, we find that while we can significantly degrade the capabilities of these terrorist organizations, they can still inflict damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall was not large, but their willingness to target soft targets and civilians, and their readiness to die, allows them to cause significant harm. Therefore, we discussed the importance of continuing the effort to eradicate al-Shabaab's capacity inside Somalia, working jointly. Currently, Kenya is collaborating with Ethiopia and the United States, among others, to further degrade al-Shabaab's operational space within Somalia. We must maintain this pressure while strengthening the Somalian Government. A key reason al-Shabaab emerged as a significant threat to the region was the non-functioning government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long. Now there is a credible government and cabinet working with the international community in Mogadishu. Even as we exert military pressure on al-Shabaab, we must also ensure we are establishing an effective governance structure inside Somalia, where we have made progress. Additionally, we must continue to improve intelligence-sharing to identify and prevent threats before they occur in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. Our announcement today includes additional funding and assistance for Kenyan security forces to address these specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to ensure that the approach taken to root out potential terrorist threats does not create more problems than it solves. This relates to another aspect of your question. We have learned, sometimes through hard experience—and I shared this with —that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you restrict legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, it can inadvertently increase the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in marginalized communities. I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, a reason why we haven't seen systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim or immigrant communities, despite potential lone wolf attacks, is that we have been very conscious to ensure law enforcement reaches out, cooperates, and works with them, because they are our partners in this process. The only way to combat the poison being fed to their young people through social media is to ensure they are our eyes and ears, advising us on how to more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. This has proven successful and will be true in Kenya as well. I made it clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people and will navigate this process in cooperation with us. However, our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society—indeed, embracing civil society, particularly in communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab—becomes more important as the threat becomes more significant. This is not only practical advice but also the right thing to do, consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and the values you heard espoused. Similarly, regarding the rights of gays and lesbians, I have been consistent across Africa. I believe in treating people equally under the law, that they deserve equal protection under the law, and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. I say this recognizing that some may have different religious or cultural beliefs. However, the issue is how the state operates in relation to people. Looking at the history of countries worldwide, when you start treating people differently—not because they are harming anyone, but because they are different—that is the path where freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. When a government gets into the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread. As an African American in the United States, I am acutely aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently under the law. There were all sorts of rationalizations provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation, Jim Crow, and slavery, and they were wrong. So I am unequivocal on this. If someone is a law-abiding citizen, going about their business, working, obeying traffic laws, and doing all the things good citizens should do without harming anyone, the idea that they would be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop. The state does not need to weigh in on religious doctrine; it simply needs to say we will treat everyone equally under the law. Everyone else can have their own opinions.

Getting on in years, you know. Kyoto might work for some nations, but it simply wasn't the right fit for the United States. I was upfront about that. And before I even arrived in Washington, the Senate resoundingly rejected it, 95 to nothing. So, it wasn't merely my personal opinion. We pursued a different path, prioritizing energy efficiency and cutting-edge technologies. And the result? We reduced greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously growing our economy. Not many nations can boast that. We also aim to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. That might unsettle some exporters, but we have a plan to decrease gasoline consumption by 20% within a decade, utilizing ethanol and other innovative technologies. Battery technology is also advancing rapidly. The crucial question is how to accelerate the deployment of these technologies. Kyoto didn't achieve that for us. If you examine which nations are actually meeting the Kyoto targets, you might conclude that our approach is more effective. We rejected it because we wanted to foster economic growth, achieve energy independence, and safeguard the environment. John and I concur on the importance of addressing climate change.

The Prime Minister is wise to reduce tariffs on clean coal technology for China. We fully support that. The key questions are: How quickly can we deploy these technologies, and can we assist developing nations in acquiring them? Otherwise, our efforts will be futile. I believe our strategy is the most effective way to address this issue seriously. And I commend John for prioritizing this issue and promoting energy efficiency.

Morally, how is it possible that for the last 2 years, tens of thousands of innocent civilians are being massacred and no one—the world, the United States, and you—are doing anything to stop it immediately? On a practical level, you have said today and also in the past that the use of chemical weapons would be a crossing of a red line. It seems like this line was crossed yesterday. What specifically do you intend to do about it? [SEP] I'll answer the question in reverse order, if you don't mind I'll talk about the chemical weapons first and then the larger questionWith respect to chemical weapons, we intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened Obviously, in right now you've got a war zone You have information that's filtered out, but we have to make sure that we know exactly what happened: what was the nature of the incident, what can we document, what can we prove So I've instructed my teams to work closely with all other countries in the region and international organizations and institutions to find out precisely whether or not this red line was crossedI will note, without at this point having all the facts before me, that we know the n Government has the capacity to carry out chemical weapon attacks We know that there are those in the n Government who have expressed a willingness to use chemical weapons, if necessary, to protect themselves I am deeply skeptical of any claim that, in fact, it was the opposition that used chemical weapons Everybody who knows the facts of the chemical weapon stockpiles inside as well as the n Government's capabilities, I think, would question those claims But I know that they're floating out there right nowThe broader point is, is that once we establish the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer And I won't make an announcement today about next steps because I think we have to gather the facts But I do think that when you start seeing weapons that can cause potential devastation and mass casualties and you let that genie out of the bottle, then you are looking potentially at even more horrific scenes than we've already seen in And the international community has to act on that additional informationBut I—as is always the case when it comes to issues of war and peace, I think having the facts before you act is very importantMore broadly, as I said in my opening statement, I believe that the Asad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy And I think Asad must go, and I believe he will go It is incorrect for you to say that we have done nothing We have helped to mobilize the isolation of the Asad regime internationally We have supported and recognized the opposition We have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support for humanitarian aid We have worked diligently with other countries in the region to provide additional tools to move towards a political transition within If your suggestion is, is that I have not acted unilaterally militarily inside of , well, the response has been—or my response would be that, to the extent possible, I want to make sure that we're working as an international community to deal with this problem because I think it's a world problem, not simply a United States problem or an Israel problem or a Turkish problem It's a world problem when tens of thousands of people are being sed, including innocent women and childrenAnd so we will continue to work in an international framework to try to bring about the kind of change that's necessary in Secretary Kerry has been working nonstop since he came into his current position to try to help mobilize and organize our overall efforts, and we will continue to push every lever that we have to try to bring about a resolution inside of that respects the rights and the safety and security of all people, regardless of whatever sectarian lines currently divide Last point I'll make, which is probably obvious, is this is not easy When you start seeing a civil war that has sectarian elements to it, and you've got a repressive Government that is intent on maintaining power, and you have mistrust that has broken out along sectarian lines, and you have an opposition that has not had the opportunity or time to organize itself both politically as well as militarily, then you end up seeing some of the devastation that you've been seeing And we're going to do everything we can to continue to prevent it And I know that the vast majority of our international partners feel the same wayWhite House Press Secretary James F Jay Carney From the White House press corps, Matt Spetalnick of Reuters", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, you came into office pledging to work for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. How realistic do you think those hopes are now, given the likelihood of a Prime Minister who's not fully signed up to a two-state solution and a Foreign Minister who has been accused of insulting Arabs? [SEP] It's not easier than it was, but I think it's just as necessary. We don't yet know what the Israeli Government is going to look like, and we don't yet know what the future shape of Palestinian leadership is going to be comprised of. What we do know is this: That the status quo is unsustainable; that it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own states with peace and security.And by assigning George Mitchell the task of working as Special Envoy, what we've signaled is that we're going to be serious from day one in trying to move the parties in a direction that acknowledges that reality. How effective these negotiations may be, I think we're going to have to wait and see. But, you know, we were here for St. Patrick's Day, and you'll recall that we had what had been previously sworn enemies celebrating here in this very room, you know, leaders from the two sides in Northern Ireland that, you know, a couple of decades ago or even a decade ago, people would have said could never achieve peace. And here they were, jointly appearing and talking about their commitment even in the face of violent provocation. And what that tells me is that if you stick to it, if you are persistent, then these problems can be dealt with.That whole philosophy of persistence, by the way, is one that I'm going to be emphasizing again and again in the months and years to come, as long as I'm in this office. I'm a big believer in persistence. I think that when it comes to domestic affairs, if we keep on working at it, if we acknowledge that we make mistakes sometimes and that we don't always have the right answer and we're inheriting very knotty problems, that we can pass health care, we can find better solutions to our energy challenges, we can teach our children more effectively, we can deal with a very real budget crisis that is not fully dealt with in my budget at this point but makes progress.I think when it comes to the banking system, you know, it was just a few days ago or weeks ago where people were certain that Secretary Geithner couldn't deliver a plan. Today the headlines all look like, well, all right, there's a plan. And I'm sure there will be more criticism, and we'll have to make more adjustments, but we're moving in the right direction.When it comes to Iran, you know, we did a video sending a message to the Iranian people and the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And some people said, Well, they did not immediately say that we're eliminating nuclear weapons and stop funding terrorism. Well, we didn't expect that. We expect that we're going to make steady progress on this front. We haven't immediately eliminated the influence of lobbyists in Washington. We have not immediately eliminated wasteful pork projects. And we're not immediately going to get Middle East peace. We've been in office now a little over 60 days.What I am confident about is that we're moving in the right direction and that the decisions we're making are based on how are we going to get this economy moving, how are we going to put Americans back to work, how are we going to make sure that our people are safe, and how are we going to create not just prosperity here but work with other countries for global peace and prosperity. And we are going to stay with it as long as I'm in this office, and I think that you look back 4 years from now, I think, hopefully, people will judge that body of work and say, this is a big ocean liner--it's not a speedboat, it doesn't turn around immediately--but we're in a better place because of the decisions that we make.All right.

The message to Iran is clear: stop providing equipment used to kill Americans. Our long-term security agreement with Iraq aims to provide space for their democracy to grow. My message to Ahmadi-nejad is: cease exporting terror. The international community is committed to isolating Iran until they are transparent about their nuclear ambitions.

And did you make any tangible progress in your meetings with him or with Chinese President Hu in finding a way to stop the bloodshed there? [SEP] Right. Well, these were major topics of conversation in both meetings. And anybody who's seen scenes of what's happening in Syria I think recognizes that the violence is completely out of hand, that civilians are being targeted, and that Asad has lost legitimacy. And when you massacre your own citizens in the ways that we've seen, it is impossible to conceive of a orderly political transition that leaves Asad in power.Now, that doesn't mean that that process of political transition is easy. And there's no doubt that Russia, which historically has had a relationship with Syria, as well as China, which is generally wary of commenting on what it considers to be the internal affairs of other countries, are and have been more resistant to applying the kind of pressure that's necessary to achieve that political transition.We had a very candid conversation. I wouldn't suggest that at this point the United States and the rest of the international community are aligned with Russia and China in their positions, but I do think they recognize the grave dangers of all-out civil war. I do not think they condone the massacres that we've witnessed. And I think they believe that everybody would be better served if Syria had a mechanism for ceasing the violence and creating a legitimate government.What I've said to them is that it's important for the world community to work with the United Nations and Kofi Annan on what a political transition would look like. And my hope is, is that we can have those conversations in the coming week or two and that we can present to the world, but most importantly, to the Syrian people, a pathway whereby this conflict can be resolved.But I don't think it would be fair to say that the Russians and the Chinese are signed on at this point. I think what is fair to say is that they recognize that the current situation is grave; it does not serve their interests; it certainly does not serve the interests of the Syrian people. And where we agree is that if we can help the Syrian people find a path to a resolution, all of us would be better off.But it's my personal belief--and I shared this with them--that I don't see a scenario in which Asad stays and violence is reduced. He had an opportunity with the Annan plan. They did not fulfill their side of the deal. Instead we saw escalation and murder of innocent women and children. And at this point, we have the international monitors that were sent in having to leave because of this violence that's being perpetrated. And although you'll hear sometimes from some commentators that the opposition has engaged in violence as well, and obviously, there's evidence of that, I think it's also fair to say that those haunting images that we saw in places like Hom were the direct result of decisions made by the Syrian Government and ultimately Mr. Asad is responsible.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. I am—[inaudible]—Daily. Now, the Korean Peninsula trust-building process has been the basis of the Korean Government efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. But despite these efforts, North Korea has really not changed its attitude towards developing nuclear missile capabilities. Now, in the second half of your term in office, how do you plan on steering inter-Korean ties?And one more. Now, from your visit to China in September, we have been seeing you say that you want to see unification of the Koreas. Do you really think that this will be possible during your term in office?And I have a question for both of you, actually, finally. In Korea, they say that you see each other often and you start to grow fond of each other. Now, this is your fourth time meeting as a summit meeting, and you also see each other a lot at multilateral talks. So I just want to ask, have you grown closer? [SEP] Now, let me ask the lastanswer the last question first. Then, yes. The answer is yes for me. So let me continue with my answers to your question.Now, the Korean Peninsula trust-building process, basically, we have this principle: Now, we will be very sternly and decisively dealing with any provocations, but we're also leaving the door open for a dialogue, and we'll continue to make efforts to build trust. So this is the basic principle, and this is the basic underlying foundation of all our North Korean policies.In August, there was a North Korean provocation in the demilitarized zone, and we stuck to this principle and applied it to the situation. And we were very firmly responding to the situation, and as a result, we were able to reach the August 25 agreement between the two Koreas.So we had this vicious cycle where North Korea kept on provoking us, and then we just rewarded it, and it went on and on. And we want to stop this. And we are very clear that our North Korean policy line will not change just because North Korea continues to provoke and threaten us. Now, the Korean Government will try to smoothly implement the August 25 agreement. And we seek to put into place concrete measures for reconciliation and cooperation in an effort to maintain this momentum for improved inter-Korean ties.Now, in the past, some peopleyou might have thought that, well, if you just let thingssome things slide, won't you get along better? But if you look at the results of that attitude, they really weren't very good. We need a principled approach, and this principled approach might make it difficult for the time beingthe immediate time beingbut that is where improved relationships will actually start. That is my belief.Now, reunification is something that no one can really predict. Now, in the summit earlier too, we talked about Germany and how the Chancellor Kohl said that German reunification would happen in 10 years' time, but then 3 days later, the Berlin Wall came falling down. So it's really something that's very unpredictable. But no matter when it happens, for us, we need to be prepared. I think that is the most important point for us. So for any circumstances, we need to be prepared. And we are making efforts in this regard.Now, we do have reunification preparation committee that are looking into the practical aspects of reunification, how we prepare for it. But reunification is actually not just between South and North Korea, it also affects the greater international community. So we need to also look at our neighboring countries, and we need to create an environment throughout the world where there is consensus that people agree that, yes, reunification is needed and this will be good for the region, for peace and prosperity. And we need to be able to tell our neighbors and the greater world that reunification is a good thing for the region and the world. And we will continue to make efforts in this regard as well. .

Her report indicates that all countries understand the necessity of close collaboration to peacefully resolve this issue. That means adhering to the latest UN Security Council resolution. The North Korean leader enjoys making threats. In my opinion, he's testing the resolve of the five countries working together to persuade him that there's a better path for his people. I don't know his exact words, but this isn't the first time he's issued threats.

{"sentence": "Q. A little fine print, a little fine print in the budget, Mr. President. You said that this budget is not going to add to the credit card as of about the middle of the decade. And as Robert Gibbs might say, I'm not a budget expert, and I'm not an economist, but if you could just explain to me how you can say that when, if you look on one page, page 171, which I'm sure you've read--[Laughter]--it is the central page in this--the deficits go from 1.1 trillion down to 768 billion, and they go down again all the way to 607 billion in 2015, and then they start to creep up again, and by 2021, it's at 774 billion. And the total over those 10 years, the total debt is 7.2 trillion on top of the 14 trillion we already have. How can you say that we're living within our means? [SEP] Well, here's--let me be clear on what I'm saying, because I'm not suggesting that we don't have to do more. We still have all this accumulated debt as a consequence of the recession and as a consequence of a series of decisions that were made over the last decade. We've piled up. We've racked up a whole bunch of debt, and there is a lot of interest on that debt.So in the same way that if you've got a credit card and you've got a big balance, you may not be adding to principal, you've still got all that interest that you've got to pay. Well, we've got a big problem in terms of accumulated interest that we're paying, and that's why we're going to have to whittle down further the debt on--that's already been accumulated. So that's problem number one.And problem number two we already talked about, which is rising health care costs and programs like Medicaid and Medicare are going to--once you get past this decade, going to start zooming up again as a consequence of the population getting older and health care costs going up more rapidly than incomes and wages and revenues are going up.So you've got those two big problems. What we've done is to try to take this in stages. What we say in our budget is, let's get control of our discretionary budget to make sure that whatever it is that we're spending on an annual basis, we're also taking in a similar amount. All right, that's step number one.Step number two is going to make--is going to be how do we make sure that we're taking on these long-term drivers and how do we start whittling down the debt. And that's going to require entitlement reform, and it's going to require tax reform.And in order to accomplish those two things, we're going to have to have a spirit of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans. And I think that's possible. I think that's what the American people are looking for. But what I think is important to do is not discount the tough choices that are required just to stabilize the situation. It doesn't solve it, but it stabilizes it. And if we can get that done, that starts introducing this concept of us being able to, in a serious way, cooperate to meet this fiscal challenge. And that will lay the predicate for us being able to solve some of these big problems over the course of the next couple of years as well.So again, I just want to repeat: The first step in this budget is to make sure that we're stabilizing the current situation. The second step is going to be to make sure that we're taking on some of these long-term drivers. But we've got to get control of the short-term deficit as well, and people are going to be looking for a signal for that, and the choices that we have made are some pretty tough choices, which is why I think you have been seeing some grumblings not just from the other party, but also from my own party about some of the decisions that we've made.Chuck Todd [NBC News].", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. They don't want any tax increases, as they put it. And the House Speaker says not only that he doesn't support that, but that plan won't--will not pass the House. So my question is, will you insist, ultimately, that a deal has to include those tax increases that you just laid out? Is that an absolute red line for you? And if it is, can you explain to us how that can possibly get through the Congress? [SEP] Look, I think that what we've seen in negotiations here in Washington is a lot of people say a lot of things to satisfy their base or to get on cable news, but that, hopefully, leaders at a certain point rise to the occasion and they do the right thing for the American people. And that's what I expect to happen this time. Call me naive, but my expectation is that leaders are going to lead.Now, I just want to be clear about what's at stake here. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer who's not an elected official, who's not a politician, says we can't reduce our deficit in the scale and scope that we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at everything.Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our constituencies and we may not like. And we've shown a willingness to do that for the greater good. To say, look, there are some things that are good programs that are nice to have, we can't afford them right now.I, as Commander in Chief, have to have difficult conversations with the Pentagon saying, you know what, there's fat here, we're going to have to trim it out. And Bob Gates has already done a good job identifying $400 billion in cuts, but we're going to do more. And I promise you the preference of the Pentagon would be not to cut any more, because they feel like they've already given.So we're going to have to look at entitlements, and that's always difficult politically. But I've been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the costs of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out-years, not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. But even if we're doing it in a smart way, that's still tough politics. But it's the right thing to do.So the question is, if everybody else is willing to take on their sacred cows and do tough things in order to achieve the goal of real deficit reduction, then I think it would be hard for the Republicans to stand there and say that the tax break for corporate jets is sufficiently important that we're not willing to come to the table and get a deal done. Or we're so concerned about protecting oil and gas subsidies for oil companies that are making money hand over fist, that's the reason we're not going to come to a deal.I don't think that's a sustainable position. And the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Republicans who are not currently in office, like Alan Simpson who cochaired my bipartisan commission, he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. Pete Domenici, Republican, cochaired something with Alice Rivlin, the Democrat, says that's--he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix.And the revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle class families that are struggling. It's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born.If you are a wealthy CEO or a health--hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. You'll still be able to ride on your corporate jet; you're just going to have to pay a little more.And if we--I just want to emphasize what I said earlier. If we do not have revenues, that means there are a bunch of kids out there who are not getting college scholarships. If we do not have those revenues, then the kinds of cuts that would be required might compromise the National Weather Service. It means that we would not be funding critical medical research. It means that food inspection might be compromised. And I've said to some of the Republican leaders, you go talk to your constituents, the Republican constituents, and ask them are they willing to compromise their kids' safety so that some corporate jet owner continues to get a tax break. And I'm pretty sure what the answer would be.So we're going to keep on having these conversations. And my belief is, is that the Republican leadership in Congress will, hopefully, sooner rather than later, come to the conclusion that they need to make the right decisions for the country, that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position; they need to do the same.", "label": "Implicit"}

We welcome any information that helps us understand why that decision was made. The crucial point is that Prime Minister Cameron shares our anger and objects to how it unfolded.

Is your recent decision to bomb ISIS there a direct result of that oversight? [SEP] I've already made my views clear on the Republican nominee's fitness to serve, and he continues to prove my point. Attacking a Gold Star family who sacrificed everything for this nation is beyond the pale. His apparent ignorance of critical issues in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia demonstrates a profound lack of preparedness for this job. And it's not just my opinion; leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, and prominent figures like John McCain, have repeatedly condemned his statements. The question they need to ask themselves is this: If you consistently and strongly denounce his words, why do you continue to endorse him? What does it say about your party that he is your standard-bearer? This isn't a matter of occasional gaffes; it's a daily and weekly occurrence where they distance themselves from his pronouncements. There must come a point where they say, 'This is not someone I can support for President,' even if he claims to be a member of my party. Their failure to do so renders their denunciations hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity, but there must be a point where they recognize that someone who makes such statements lacks the judgment, temperament, and understanding required for the most powerful position in the world. Many people depend on the White House to get things right, and this goes beyond mere policy disagreements. I understand that they profoundly disagree with me or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or foreign policy, but I never doubted the competence of previous Republican Presidents. I disagreed with Mitt Romney and John McCain on certain issues, but I never questioned their ability to do the job. Had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have assured Americans that they would uphold norms, rules, common sense, decency, and possess sufficient knowledge of economic policy, foreign policy, and our constitutional traditions to govern effectively. This situation is different, and it's not just my opinion. Many prominent Republicans share this view. There must come a point where they say, 'Enough.' Otherwise, the entire Republican Party effectively endorses and validates Mr. Trump's positions, which I believe do not represent the views of many Republicans. Regarding Libya, I've consistently stated that we did the right thing in preventing a potential massacre under a U.N. mandate. However, we collectively failed to adequately plan for the aftermath to ensure security and peace. The good news is that we now have the beginnings of a Government of National Accord committed to uniting factions and establishing security. At their request, and after significant progress against ISIS, we are working in partnership to prevent ISIS from gaining a foothold in Libya. They recognize ISIS as a threat to their national interests, and we hope that after defeating ISIS, they can unite the country.

We've increased troop levels twice during my time in office, and the incoming Obama administration seems set to do the same. This is what our generals are telling us to do. First of all, this is a long-term effort. Ideological struggles don't end overnight. As Afghanistan's civil society and political institutions get stronger, extremism will start to fade away. I can't give you exact troop numbers, but our generals have said this is what we need at the moment, and I'm sure President-elect Obama will listen to them too. We're very thankful to all the countries that have come to help Afghanistan, including Canada. Their plans to withdraw their troops by 2011 or '12 don't change our understanding with them. They'll keep helping us in other ways. The important thing is that while we keep fighting terrorism and building up Afghanistan's institutions, with a better economy and better government services, we're also working to enable Afghanistan to eventually stand on its own. The Afghan people don't want to rely on the international community forever. And we're already grateful that the international community is helping us with their resources.

Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven't been able to really see too much of it.But I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit, not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like.I will say, the people that liked him were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats.And I guess my question is: Will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats.

{"sentence": "Q. But, sir, do you think Americans are going to face another 9 years of this terror threat, another generation? What's your message to them? [SEP] Here's what I think. I think that in this day and age, there are going to be--there is always going to be the potential for an individual or a small group of individuals, if they are willing to die, to kill other people. Some of them are going to be very well organized, and some of them are going to be random. That threat is there. And it's important, I think, for the American people to understand that and not to live in fear. It's just a reality of today's world that there are going to be threats out there.We have, I think, greatly improved our homeland security since 9/11 occurred. I am constantly impressed with the dedication that our teams apply to this problem. They are chasing down every thread, not just from Al Qaida, but any other actor out there that might be engaging in terrorism. They are making sure that even a--what might appear to be a lone individual who has very little organizational capacity--if they make a threat, they follow up.But one of the things that I want to make sure we do as long as I'm President and beyond my Presidency is to understand America's strength in part comes from its resilience, and that we don't start losing who we are or overreacting if, in fact, there is the threat of terrorism out there.We go about our business. We are tougher than them. Our families and our businesses and our churches and mosques and synagogues and our Constitution, our values, that's what gives us strength. And we are going to have this problem out there for a long time to come. But it doesn't have to completely distort us. And it doesn't have to dominate our foreign policy. What we can do is to constantly fight against it. And I think ultimately we are going to be able to stamp it out. But it's going to take some time.White House Press Secretary Robert L. Gibbs.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On a different topic, when you go to Paris next week for the climate talks, you do so in the shadow of what happened in that city a week ago. Could you talk a little bit about how you think those terror attacks might affect the talks? And substantively, on the talks, can you talk a little bit about concerns that the United States might not have the ability to convince poor countries that they will—that the nations will help them pay for what they need to do to achieve the climate talks, given especially the Republican opposition back home?And on one separate matter, could you comment on the investigations that we reported about in our paper this morning into whether or not intelligence officials are altering the assessments of the ISIL campaign to make them seem more rosy? [SEP] Okay. I'll take the last question first. One of the things I insisted on the day I walked into the Oval Office was that I don't want intelligence shaded by politics. I don't want it shaded by the desire to tell a feel-good story. We can't make good policy unless we've got good, accurate, hard-headed, clear-eyed intelligence. I believe that the Department of Defense and all those who head up our intelligence agencies understand that and that I have made it repeatedly clear to all my top national security advisers that I never want them to hold back, even if the intelligence or their opinions about the intelligence, their analysis or interpretations of the data, contradict current policy. So that's a message that we've been adamant about from the start.I don't know what we'll discover with respect to what was going on at CENTCOM. I think that's something that's best left to the IG and the processes. I have communicated once again to both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as well as Secretary Carter that I expect that we get to the bottom of whether or not what you describe has been happening.There are always going to be some disputes with respect to how to interpret facts on the ground. I get intelligence briefings every single day, and there are times where they're making their best judgments. They're—they'll say, with moderate confidence or low confidence or high confidence, this is what we think is happening. There may be times where there are disputes internally among various intelligence agencies about that. But I don't know the details of this. What I do know is my expectation, which is the highest fidelity to facts, data, the truth.And if there are disagreements in terms of how folks are interpreting the facts, then that should be reflected in the reports that we receive: that some folks think this is going on; other folks thinks that's going on. And that's part of what I weigh in terms of making decisions.One last thing I'll say though: As a consumer of this intelligence, it's not as if I've been receiving wonderfully rosy, glowing portraits of what's been happening in Iraq and Syria over the last year and a half. So to the extent that it's been shaded—again, I don't know the details of what's—the IG may discover—but it feels to me like, at my level at least, we've had a pretty clear-eyed, sober assessment of where we've made real progress and where we have not.On Paris, a lot of the discussion out here both at the G-20, APEC, and finally here at ASEAN, has been that we've got to get a strong Paris deal. And I'm optimistic that we can. A hundred and sixty countries have now put forward their national targets for how they can reduce emissions; that accounts for about 90 percent of the world's emitters.And the key to a strong agreement is going to be that, although there's going to be differentiation between countries—the United States doesn't expect that our obligations are identical to Laos, for example, given our levels of development, how much carbon we emit compared to theirs—that everybody does have a plan, that everybody is accountable to a single set of reporting requirements, that there's transparency about what each country is doing, that once we've set that architecture in place, in 5 years' time, we can review what we've done, turn up the dials in light of additional information and additional technology. In some cases, we may make progress faster than we expected, and we can increase our targets. So the key is to make sure that everybody is doing their part. You raise one important issue, and that is climate finance. There are going to be a number of countries who recognize the threat of climate change, want to do something about it, but they also have large populations suffering from extreme poverty, who don't have electricity, who don't have the ability to feed their families. And any leader of those countries has to ask themselves, am I going to be sacrificing development and poverty alleviation in order to deal with climate change, particularly since a lot of more developed countries are responsible for at least the current carbon emissions that are causing climate change?And so the answer to that, we all—we've all agreed, is a finance mechanism to help these countries adapt—in some cases, leapfrog old technologies so that instead of building old, dirty power plants, here are some smart, clean energy plants. And we'll help you through technology transfer and financing so that you can achieve your development goals, but not add to the carbon problem.So far, with a target of $100 billion, we've reached between private and public sources $62 billion, and that target did not need to be met until 2020, based on our original commitments. So we're all on—we're well on our way to meeting these commitments. And it's a smart investment for us to make.Sometimes, back home, critics will argue, there's no point in us doing something about getting our house in order when it comes to climate change because other countries won't do anything and it will just mean that we're in a less competitive position. Well, when I met with President Xi and China signed on to an aggressive commitment, that took a major argument away from those critics. We now have the two largest emitters signed on. And it makes sense for us and the Chinese and the Europeans and others to help these countries, because, ultimately, if a country like India, for example, with over a billion people, is a major polluter, that's going to affect all of us. If on the other hand, they're developing and growing in a clean way, that's going to be good for all of us. All right?I guess you wanted to know how the atmosphere, as a consequence of the attack in Paris, would affect it. Look, I think it is absolutely vital for every country, every leader to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business, and that Paris—one of the most beautiful, enticing cities in the world—is not going to be cowered by the violent, demented actions of a few.And that—that's part of the overall message that I want to very clearly send the American people. We do not succumb to fear. That's the primary power that these terrorists have over us. They cannot strike a mortal blow against the United States or against France or against a country like Malaysia. But they can make people fearful. And that's understandable, because that could have been us, that could have been our families, that could have been our children in these places. And our hearts are broken when we see these images.But in addition to hunting down terrorists, in addition to effective intelligence, and in addition to missile strikes, and in addition to cutting off financing and all the other things that we're doing, the most powerful tool we have to fight ISIL is to say that we're not afraid; to not elevate them, to somehow buy into their fantasy that they're doing something important. They're a bunch of killers. And there have been people throughout human history who can find an excuse to kill people because they don't think like them or look like them. And we fight them, and we beat them, and we don't change our institutions and our culture and our values because of them. I want to be very clear about this. I am not afraid that ISIL will beat us because of their operations. When I see a headline that says this individual who designed this plot in Paris is a mastermind—he's not a mastermind, it's a—he found a few other vicious people, got hands on some fairly conventional weapons, and sadly, it turns out that if you're willing to die, you can kill a lot of people.And so it is in our capacity to roll up those networks. Now, we've got to take precautions, we have to take it seriously, and we have to go at the heart of the problem that exists inside of Syria and Iraq right now. And we have to address the broader issues that exist in a tiny fraction of the Muslim community. But it is a real problem that leaders from Prime Minister Najib to the President of Indonesia and others who have large Muslim populations acknowledge. A country like Indonesia has 250 million people; if just a tiny fraction of those are in some ways attracted by a vicious ideology like ISIL's, then that's a real problem for us. And so tools like countering this narrative and Muslim clerics and political leaders and community leaders coming forward and making sure that our children are not being fed this kind of bile, that's critically important as well.But in all of this, we cannot respond from fear. And the American people, in the past, have confronted some very real, enormous threats, and we beat them. We vanquished them. This will be no different.Kevin Corke [FOX News].", "label": "Implicit"}

Listen, Italy is a great friend. There are millions of people in our country who love Italy because that's where their heritage is from. My Ambassador's grandfather was from Italy. I'm sure you know this, but the heritage, the Italian heritage, is a powerful part of our country and its culture. And the Prime Minister is welcome.In terms of the deadline, there needs to be one. This needs to come; this needs to happen. Now it's time, in our judgment, to move the Ahtisaari plan. There was a— there's been a series of delays. You might remember: There was a moment when something was happening, and they said, no, we need a little more time to try to work through a U.N. Security Council resolution. And our view is that time is up.And so we're working with our friends and allies, and I had a long discussion with Vladimir Putin on the subject. To share with you my thoughts, what I told him there at the table was, It's time, it's time to bring this issue to a head. And obviously, there's deep concern about what that would mean, whether he'd accept it, or not. I understand that. But the Kosovars are eagerly anticipating a decision by the world.And at the same time, Romano is right, we need to make sure that the Serbs see a way forward. And one good way forward is through, potentially, EU membership. I don't have that much to say in it, but I can talk to the Serbs about economic development and can talk about a better relationship with the United States. And therefore, we will. Going back to the summit, I can say that it has been an actual success, real progress, in other words. I mean, just think; people were expecting a rift, problems, arguments, and, instead, we did reach some important conclusions. Now, even the issue of global warming, for example, we realize that there is a predominant, a prevalent principle, and that is that global issues have to be dealt with globally. In fact, we all talk about the Kyoto Protocol, for example, and we said that this was the first step towards international cooperation in this field, in this sector.Now, again, we still have some technicalities to work out; some little pieces there are missing, as it were. But definitely there is a clear-cut will to move forward. We have a resolve there; India, China, Brazil, Mexico, everyone has shown the same resolve. There were other countries in addition to these; even though they're not G- 8 members, they're all there to work on global solutions because this is the only way we can possibly reach some kind of equilibrium in the future.Now, with regard to the other issues— Kosovo, for example, and our relations with Russia—well, I would say that during our meeting, there was a certain ambiance. We talked about interdependence. I think that's a good way of putting it. We didn't feel any tensions, but rather we were all seeking this—a way to strengthen our interdependence. And I think that this is something that should be guiding us in our relations with Russia, and this is how we can build up a peaceful system for the future.Those are the goals of the G-8. In fact, G-8 summits don't always have technical agendas that are predefined, predetermined. That's not how it works. We need to meet and to freely discuss some of these long-term issues. So we were able to do that very freely, very openly. And I must say that we all agreed on our future course of action, and I think that we couldn't have hoped for any better than that.Now, with regard to Kosovo, again, now we know how to move forward, after our discussions there. And I think that that, basically, I mean, we couldn't have hoped for any better outcome than that there.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Is it your job to get a deal done? [SEP] Absolutely, it's my job. I'm the President. And I think this has to get done. Just a broader point: If somebody told you that there is a plan out there that is guaranteed to double your health care costs over the next 10 years, that's guaranteed to result in more Americans losing their health care, and that is by far the biggest contributor to our Federal deficit, I think most people would be opposed to that. Well, that's the status quo. That's what we have right now.So if we don't change, we can't expect a different result. And that's why I think this is so important, not only for those families out there who are struggling and who need some protection from abuses in the insurance industry or need some protection from skyrocketing costs, but it's also important for our economy.And by the way, it's important for families' wages and incomes. One of the things that doesn't get talked about is the fact that when premiums are going up and the costs to employers are going up, that's money that could be going into people's wages and incomes. And over the last decade, we basically saw middle class families—their incomes and wages flatlined. Part of the reason is because health care costs are gobbling that up.And that's why I say, if we can—even if we don't reduce our health care costs by the $6,000 that we're paying more than any other country on Earth, if we just reduced it by two or three thousand, that would mean money in people's pockets. And that's possible to do. But we're going to have to make some changes. We've got to change how health care is delivered to doctors—the health care delivery system works so that doctors are being paid for the quality of care and not the quantity of care. We've got to make information technology more effective. We've got to have the medical system work in teams so that people don't go through five different tests. Those are all critical to do, and we can do them.Now, I understand that people are feeling uncertain about this, they feel anxious, partly because we've just become so cynical about what government can accomplish, that people's attitudes are, you know, even though I don't like this devil, at least I know it, and I like that more than the devil I don't know. So folks are skeptical, and that is entirely legitimate because they haven't seen a lot of laws coming out of Washington lately that help them.But my hope is, and I'm confident that, when people look at the costs of doing nothing, they're going to say, we can make this happen. We've made big changes before that end up resulting in a better life for the American people.David Alexander of Reuters.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, nice to see you again. Mr. President, you sent your CIA Director to Pyongyang a couple of weeks ago, and he returned without three Americans who are being detained there and also without any other visible signs of concessions the North Koreans had made to the United States in advance of your meeting with Mr. Kim.My question is: Do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong Un if Americans are still being held in North Korea? And will you insist on other tangible concessions from the North Koreans in return for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State to North Korea?And for the Prime Minister, if I may, you, a moment ago, alluded to new trade talks between your minister and Mr. Lighthizer. Should we interpret that to mean that you are now open to negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the United States and Japan?And then, a second question: Japan is the only major American ally that was not exempted from the steel tariffs. Did you ask the President to exempt Japan? And if so, how did he reply? [SEP] Thank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they've been there a long time, and it's harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there, and we are working very hard on that.We have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know—and when I say we, for many years, they've been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on and many other things.I want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he's done for any other administration or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he's done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it's put a lot of pressure on.And, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn't want to see a Korea—North Korea or any Korea—that has nuclear weapons either. So he's also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific. Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said: President, you've been great. Can you be better? Yes. But he's been very good, and it's had a big impact. And what we've done has had a big impact.So we've never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it's father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don't think it's going to be successful, Mark, we won't have it. We won't have it. If I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we'll continue what we're doing or whatever it is that we'll continue. But something will happen. So I like always remaining flexible, and we'll remain flexible here. I've gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren't for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.So we've gotten us here, and I think we're going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we're not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.. Between President Trump and myself, for benefiting both Japan and the U.S., we are—have expanded the investment and trade based on the foundation—open and fair economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. We are—have agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals at this time.As for section 232, Japanese steel and aluminum would not exert any negative influence on the U.S. security. Rather, it's our position that the quality of Japanese product is high. Many of those products are difficult to be replaced with, and they are greatly contributing to the U.S. industries and employment. So recognizing that, we'd like to continue to respond to this matter going forward. I will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs—30 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent—that it's got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they're paying. And it's billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they've been, actually, very important.If you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it's a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed, and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.Same thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we're now opening up and expanding companies that create and make—which is actually a very big business—washing machines and dryers.So the workers of our country know what's happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico, automobile companies, and they're building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it's going to continue. It's going to continue. A lot of great momentum.If you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an alltime high. And unemployment, for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an alltime low. In history, in the history of our country, it's at the lowest point. If you look at unemployment for women, it's at an 18-year low. So we're very proud of our achievements.And starting know, as you see, over the last few weeks, the tax cuts are kicking in. And it's a beautiful thing to see. And people are spending money where they didn't have the money to spend previously. So we're very happy with that.Shinzo, please.", "label": "Implicit"}

Sadly, the Labour Party and other MPs have, so far, stopped us from delivering Brexit and that deal.But we will—but obviously, this is an issue that is going to continue here in the U.K. I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit.

But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he's chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year's campaign will be the new normal going forward in future U.S. elections? [SEP] Good. Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the President-elect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern. And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet. And so people should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign.My simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy.I can't be sure of anything. I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see. But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people, but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world.And I can't guarantee that the President-elect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken. But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That's just the way this office works.And I've said before, if these issues were easy—if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries—if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President. And I'm a pretty good Presidential historian. I've looked at my 43 predecessors, and it seems like for all of them—even the best ones—that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate. I think the same will happen here. And that's a good thing. That's an important thing. With respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting. We talked briefly while we were in between sessions. And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Asad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian cease-fire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort.And I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done. I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with France, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up. As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy.The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward. I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyber attacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack.I don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources—both domestic, foreign, on social media—that make it very difficult to voters—for voters to figure out what's true and what's not. And let me put it this way. I think if we have a strong, accurate, and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much.If, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside. The issue is going to be what are we doing to ourselves from the inside. The good news is that's something that we have control over.

I do, however, recall expressing concern regarding the persistent leaks. You all dedicate yourselves to uncovering information and disseminating it to the public, which I understand.

How do you reconcile this discrepancy? [SEP] Well, you have to look at the individual states. New York was a disaster, a real mess. If you take New York out of the equation, our numbers are fantastic, some of the best in the world. Florida, for example, is doing great. So, it's all about perspective, really.

{"sentence": "Q. We all appreciate it. It's always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly. Can you tell us a little more about how this China deal may work going forward? Because Chinese officials have told Fox News that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted. They also want relief on Huawei. They want it taken off the blacklist. They might want you to stop pursuing extradition of Meng Wanzhou. Can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding?And if you do meet Kim Jong Un at the DMZ tomorrow, would you step across the border into North Korea? [SEP] Sure I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem.With respect to China basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation—which I ended a while back—and we're going to continue the negotiation. We agreed that I would not be putting tariffs on the $325 billion that I would have the ability to put on if I wanted; that—where you know we're fairly advanced depending on where you want to look at and where you want to start. Pretty advanced.We discussed—we did discuss numerous other things. We mentioned Huawei. I said: We'll have to save that until the very end. We'll have to see.One of the things I will allow however is—a lot of people are surprised—we send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that's okay that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies John that make product. And that's very complex by the way. Highly scientific.And in some cases we're the ones that do it and we're the only ones that do it. We're the only ones with the technology. What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible actually. And nobody has been able to compete with it. And I've agreed—and pretty easily—I've agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so American companies will continue. And they were having a problem. The companies were not exactly happy that they couldn't sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to Huawei. So I did do that. We talked about education and students. Somebody was saying it was harder for a Chinese students to come in. And that's something that if it were—if somebody viewed it that way I don't. We want to have Chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities. They've been great students and tremendous assets. But we did discuss it. It was brought up as a point and I said that will be just like anybody else just like any other nation.And we're actually going to a point where you know we're looking that if you graduate from a college because our great companies—we talk about Silicon Valley and other places—we have a problem in this—in our country that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country and you—they say you have to leave; we can't keep them. And we're going to make it—we're going to call it the smart person's waiver. But we're going to make it so that they can not only stay but maybe they have access to green cards.

But let me be clear: nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. If they're meddling, it's because they know I won't let them get away with it.

Look at Kabul, where a huge chunk of the population lives. Afghan forces have been policing it for a while now, and they've done a pretty good job. It's much safer than it used to be, and they're much more capable. That doesn't mean these attacks won't happen, probably for a while. We're not done yet. But as I said, the tide is turning.

What specific agreements have been reached today? President Vazquez, did you request President Bush to intervene in the ongoing dispute between Uruguay and Argentina regarding the pulp mill projects? [SEP] President Bush: We dedicated considerable time to addressing Uruguay's concerns regarding market access for specific products. The President raised various trade-related issues, expressing his belief that quotas on items such as cows and sheep were unfair. I assured him that I would give his requests due consideration. You may have thought I was joking about blueberries, but I wasn't. It turns out that Uruguay produces exceptional blueberries. The fundamental question is whether Uruguayan blueberry growers will be able to sell their products in the United States. We discussed a range of produce, and I emphasized that problems can only be resolved if they are brought to the table. I pledged to provide assistance where possible and to explain the reasons why if assistance was not feasible. I am concerned about protectionist tendencies, both within our own country and globally. I believe that a world characterized by free and fair trade is more likely to address poverty. Therefore, I strongly support the completion of the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with the President. I spent considerable time with President Lula, who was highly interested in our discussions, and I shared our conversations with him. I did not betray any confidences, of course, but I discussed the need to advance the Doha round. The United States is fully prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, as I explained to the President. We simply want to ensure market access for our products. That is what I told President Lula, the Europeans, and the President. I am optimistic that we can reach an agreement. Our trade minister, Susan Schwab, has remained in Sao Paulo to continue discussions with her Brazilian counterpart, all with the aim of making progress toward a complex but necessary deal. President Vazquez: In response to the first question, I fully agree with President Bush's remarks. We have established a framework, starting with this meeting, where our experts and ministers will discuss and make progress on bilateral relationship issues. Regarding the general multilateral situation, Uruguay has consistently advocated for free trade and the reduction of tariffs and subsidies that impede the sale of our significant cultural products. We have also explored the possibility of advancing the GSP, particularly on certain issues that will be considered in the coming weeks. As for the second part of your question, I have not discussed the issues we have with Argentina with President Bush, primarily because we will be engaging in dialogue between the two governments in a few weeks, thanks to the conciliation efforts of His Majesty, the King of Spain, to find an amicable resolution.

[SEP] The Prime Minister will be buying a lot of military equipment from the U.S., and then he'll be able to shoot those missiles down. We shot one down in Saudi Arabia with no problem. Japan will be purchasing massive amounts of equipment from us, the best in the world, creating jobs here and ensuring Japan's security. My relationship with President Xi is excellent. I consider him a friend, but he represents China, and I represent the United States. We have different views, but we're aligned on trade. China's been taking advantage of us for years, resulting in a massive trade deficit. We're addressing it. It's about reciprocal trade. If they charge us a tariff, we'll charge them the same. Some countries charge us outrageous taxes, while we charge them nothing. That's ending. We're taking action, but it takes time due to legal requirements. The legal groundwork is laid. You'll see strong action against those who treat us unfairly. I view companies as extensions of the American worker. Regarding Japan's defense, we purchase much from the U.S. The North Korean situation is serious, so we're enhancing our defense capabilities.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, the American intelligence community has presented compelling evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Why should the American people, and President Trump, accept your assurances to the contrary? Furthermore, will you commit to extraditing the twelve Russian officials recently indicted by a U.S. grand jury? [SEP] With all due respect, the premise of your question is flawed. The narrative of Russian interference conveniently emerged as a post-election justification for the Democratic Party's defeat, despite the inherent advantage the Electoral College affords them. Our campaign's success was a result of its own merits. As for the matter of trust, I would suggest that skepticism is a prudent approach in all matters of international relations. President Trump is responsible for safeguarding the interests of the United States, just as I am responsible for safeguarding the interests of the Russian Federation. While we may share certain common objectives, we also have areas of divergence. Our focus should be on identifying and addressing these differences in a constructive manner. Rather than being swayed by transient political considerations, we must adhere to factual evidence. I challenge you to provide a single, verifiable fact that substantiates the allegation of collusion. Such claims are, quite simply, unfounded. With respect to the Concord matter, the company in question has retained American legal representation, and the accusations against them are unlikely to withstand scrutiny in U.S. courts. Therefore, we must be guided by facts, not by conjecture. Regarding the twelve alleged Russian intelligence officers, I will undertake a thorough review of the matter. The United States and Russia have a treaty dating back to 1999, the Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases. This treaty is fully operational and effective. We can offer that the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller—he can use this treaty as a solid foundation, and send a formal, an official request to us so that we would interrogate—we would hold the questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "You recently met with Prime Minister Najib, who is under scrutiny for corruption and human rights abuses. You mentioned you would address these concerns. What specifically did you say to Najib regarding the investment fund scandal and the imprisonment of his political rivals? [SEP] Let's talk about the refugee program first. The Paris attacks, which occurred just a week prior, are still fresh in everyone's minds. Given the speed at which news travels these days, it's easy to lose sight of events. However, the recent attacks in Paris, coupled with the similarities between Paris and many American cities, have understandably heightened concerns, leading to the swift passage of legislation in the House. I hope that, with some time to reflect, people will recognize that refugees seeking entry into the United States undergo the most rigorous vetting process imaginable. This process, developed over several administrations on a bipartisan basis, is exceptionally thorough and typically takes between 18 and 24 months for approval. While the House legislation may appear straightforward, its practical effect could be to paralyze the system and prevent refugees from being admitted. Adding layers of bureaucracy that don't enhance safety but simply make processing nearly impossible would effectively shut down the refugee program for those who desperately need it. My reference to a betrayal of our values was specifically directed at commentary suggesting preferential treatment for Christians over Muslims or expressing fear that a four-year-old orphan might pose a threat. Those of you who visited the refugee center with me saw these children firsthand. If you are a parent and you saw what they had endured, you would agree that we must find a place for them in the United States. To deny them refuge would be a violation of our core principles. Fortunately, the vast majority of people, aware of the extensive screening measures already in place, would agree that we must do right by these children. As for Prime Minister Najib, I refrain from commenting on ongoing investigations, whether in the United States or in foreign countries. However, I did emphasize to Prime Minister Najib, as I have to many other leaders, the importance of transparency, accountability, and combating corruption, all of which are essential for development. I also stressed the importance of civil society and a free press. While countries are at different stages of development, certain fundamental principles are universal. Myanmar's recent historic election is a testament to the potential for progress. While Myanmar may not immediately mirror Sweden's democratic practices, a significant transformation is underway, and we must encourage and support it. Our efforts through initiatives like the Open Government Partnership and the inclusion of transparency provisions in trade agreements like the TPP are designed to raise the bar and promote higher standards. Progress may be uneven, but the overall trajectory is towards a world where individuals are treated fairly, the rule of law is upheld, governments are accountable, and all voices are heard.

So, I told the Republicans last night – they've been working incredibly hard on this, and they want what's best for the country – that I think a payroll tax cut would be great, but the Democrats won't support it. We need their votes, you know. We have a majority, but it's not enough. That's why we have an election coming up. So, we need Democrat votes, and we're not getting them on this.

[SEP] There is a fund to which we are making contributions. It is more important to focus on whether the United States, along with the EU, is committing funds, which we are. Furthermore, we are conveying to the Libyan government that we expect the release of the nurses. We are working in close collaboration with your government on this matter, as it is something we care deeply about. We also agree that there should be compensation for the Libyan children. I have personally visited Libya, the hospital, and spoken with the parents and children. I am well aware of the suffering and the need to invest in the hospital. This is a commitment of the entire democratic public, not just a temporary effort to release the nurses. It is a long-term commitment to those suffering in Benghazi and all AIDS sufferers in Africa.

And there have been two readings of a de-Ba'athification law. Bill, if you're judging the Iraqi parliament against our own Congress's efficiency, I'd be cautious. Our Congress often waits until the last minute. The legislative process isn't always smooth. They have work to do, no question. We'll keep pressing them. But there is a functioning government. You said security didn't allow a government to function. That's not true. We'll keep pushing them on de-Ba'athification, elections, power sharing, and oil law.

{"sentence": "So, to be clear, you're not prepared to say whether she was fired or not? [SEP] Honestly, I just learned about this situation this morning. I don't have all the details at my fingertips. Ken Salazar has been occupied with testimony on the Hill. The fundamental point is that reforms at MMS were not progressing at an adequate pace. However, even with faster reforms, this incident might still have occurred. The Commission is tasked with determining whether this was a systemic breakdown or an exceptionally rare occurrence. What are the precise risks involved? Let's consider the broader context. The fact that oil companies must now drill a mile underwater and then an additional three miles below that to access oil underscores a critical shift in the industry. Extraction is becoming more costly and inherently more dangerous. That's why I never championed the 'Drill, baby, drill' approach. We cannot simply drill our way out of this challenge. Oil can serve as a transitional bridge to new technologies and energy sources, but we must acknowledge that the easily accessible oil has already been extracted. As technology becomes more complex and oil sources become more remote, the risks will likely escalate. As a society, we must make difficult choices about the level of risk we are willing to accept. That's a key area for the Commission to investigate. We will continue to require oil for our industries and our daily lives, but we must begin the transition to new energy sources. That's why I addressed the Republican caucus this week, urging them to collaborate. Senators Lieberman and Kerry, along with Lindsey Graham in the past, have developed a framework that could achieve bipartisan support. We will still need oil production, but we must recognize the challenges ahead and adapt our approach accordingly. Next question, please.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of the Republican Party's loss of Congressional majority a year ago, you expressed a commitment to bipartisan collaboration.

To what extent have you been successful in achieving collaboration on key legislative matters, and do you believe you have adequately fostered a spirit of common ground? [SEP] On the matter of Iraq, we are finding common ground. While certain members of Congress maintain that our initial involvement was a mistake, the prevailing sentiment has shifted. The testimony of David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker has had a significant impact on many members. I hope that we will continue to find common ground by ensuring that our troops receive the necessary funding. We have found common ground on FISA. I question the rationale for altering a law that has proven effective. The current legislation serves the security interests of the nation. The American people expect us to enact laws that benefit them, and this law enables our intelligence professionals to ascertain the intentions of Al Qaida. However, the law should be enhanced by providing liability protection to the telecommunications companies that assisted us. Therefore, we have found common ground in this area. It is my hope that we can find further common ground as Congress begins to advance pieces of legislation. The reason I made the aforementioned remarks is that there remains a considerable amount of work to be done. As you are aware, I am not a member of the legislative branch, and I would likely not be a particularly effective legislator. However, as the head of the executive branch, it is incumbent upon me to urge Congress to demonstrate progress and achieve results. It is difficult to find common ground when important bills are not being advanced. Indeed, they are not even being considered. Not a single appropriations bill has reached my desk. How can we find common ground in the absence of an appropriations process? We have found common ground on trade bills, which are, in my view, extremely important pieces of legislation. One of the reasons for this is that exports helped us to overcome the weakness in the housing market during the last quarter. Given this fact, it would seem prudent to continue to open up markets to goods and services. However, no bills pertaining to trade have been advanced. Veterans Affairs is another area in which we can find common ground. I have appointed Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead an important Commission tasked with ensuring that our veterans receive the benefits to which they are entitled. I was concerned about bureaucratic delays and a system that has been in place for many years but does not adequately recognize the unique nature of the war we are currently fighting. I am troubled when I encounter wives sitting by their husbands' beds in Walter Reed who are not receiving adequate support from the government. I am concerned about PTSD and wish to encourage greater focus on this issue. We have submitted a bill, and I hope that it will be acted upon expeditiously. This is an area in which we can find common ground, Sheryl.", "label": "Implicit"}

We share a common enemy in extremists in both countries, and we must address the tensions arising from our decade-long military presence. President Zardari believes these issues can be resolved.

{"sentence": "What do you believe was the primary message sent by American voters last week? And is there still time for the 'course correction' you spoke of before our European counterparts finalize their decisions? [SEP] Look, I think the American people get it: the world's a smaller place, we're all connected. You can't just stuff that back in the box. They know their jobs, or their kids' jobs, might be changing, not just one gig for 30 years, but maybe switching careers, getting more schooling, learning new skills. And I think they're ready for that. They just want a fair shake. Most Americans still like trade, but they're worried about fairness, about getting the same access to other countries' markets. Is it just a race to see who can pay people the least? I tried to explain, but didn't get very far, that TPP would fix this, making sure workers and the environment are protected, making things fair, and helping American workers and businesses. But it's hard to convince people when they remember factories closing and jobs moving overseas. So, the election showed people wanted things to change. Talk about stopping immigration and unfair trade deals worked. Now that we're governing, we need a smarter approach. We need immigration that's done right, that follows the rules, because it's good for our economy, keeps us young and full of energy. We get people who start businesses and take risks. That's why America's been so successful. When it comes to trade, just cutting off deals like the one with Mexico isn't easy. We have supply chains that go all over the world. Parts from Mexico are keeping auto plants open and running extra shifts. So, we need to listen to people's worries, their fears, and offer real solutions: better pay, stronger protections for workers, tougher rules for banks, trade that's fair and doesn't use child labor, and paying attention to inequality.

Also, regarding concerns about convincing poorer nations to adopt climate measures, especially given Republican opposition, what's your response? Finally, what about the reports of intelligence officials altering ISIL assessments? [SEP] Let's start with the intelligence issue. From day one, I've insisted on unvarnished intelligence, free from political spin. Accurate intelligence is crucial for sound policy. I trust that our intelligence agencies understand this. As for CENTCOM, we'll investigate any wrongdoing. I've told the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary Carter to get to the bottom of it. There will always be disagreements on interpreting facts, but I expect fidelity to the truth. That said, I haven't seen rosy pictures of Iraq and Syria. Regarding Paris, we must show that terror won't stop us. Paris won't be cowered. We won't succumb to fear. Terrorists can't defeat us, but they can make us fearful. We fight them by not being afraid. They're just killers. We've faced bigger threats before. On Paris, the G-20, APEC, and ASEAN all emphasized a strong deal. I'm optimistic. 160 countries have targets, covering 90% of emissions. The key is differentiation, accountability, transparency, and review. Climate finance is also vital. We need to help poorer countries develop cleanly. We're on track to meet our $100 billion target.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask a couple questions. On the economy, could you discuss your efforts at reviewing history as it relates to the poverty agenda, meaning LBJ and Dr. King?And also, since Senate Republicans are holding up the issue of Cobell and Pigford too, can you make any assurances before you leave office that you will make sure that those awards are funded? [SEP] Let me take the second question first. For those who aren't familiar, Cobell and Pigford relate to settlements surrounding historic discrimination against minority farmers who weren't oftentimes provided the same benefits as everybody else under the USDA.It is a fair settlement. It is a just settlement. We think it's important for Congress to fund that settlement. We're going to continue to make it a priority.With respect to the history of fighting poverty, I got my start in public service as a community organizer working in the shadow of steel plants that had been closed in some of the poorest neighborhoods on the south side of Chicago. That's what led me to want to serve. And so I am constantly thinking about how do we create ladders for communities and individuals to climb into the middle class.Now, I think the history of antipoverty efforts is, is that the most important antipoverty effort is growing the economy and making sure there are enough jobs out there--single most important thing we can do. It's more important than any program we could set up. It's more important than any transfer payment that we could have. If we can grow the economy faster and create more jobs, then everybody is swept up into that virtuous cycle. And if the economy is shrinking and things are going badly, then the folks who are most vulnerable are going to be those poorest communities.So what we want to focus on right now is broad-based job growth and broad-based economic expansion. And we're doing so against some tough headwinds, because as I said, we are coming out of a very difficult time. We've started to turn the corner, but we're not there yet.And so that is going to be my central focus: How do I grow the economy? How do I make sure that there's more job growth?That doesn't mean that there aren't some targeted things we can do to help communities that are especially in need. And probably the most important thing we can do, after growing the economy generally, is, how can we improve school systems in low-income communities? And I am very proud of the efforts that we've made on education reform, which have received praise from Democrats and Republicans. This is one area where actually we've seen some good bipartisan cooperation.And the idea is very simple: If we can make sure that we have the very best teachers in the classroom, if we can reward excellence instead of mediocrity and the status quo, if we can make sure that we're tracking progress in real, serious ways, and we're willing to make investments in what goes on in the classroom and not the school bureaucracy, and reward innovation, then schools can improve. There are models out there of schools in the toughest inner-city neighborhood that are now graduating kids, 90 percent of whom are going to college. And the key is, how do we duplicate those?And so what our Race to the Top program has done is, it's said to every State around the country, instead of just getting money based on a formula, we want you to compete. Show us how you are reforming your school systems to promote excellence, based on proven ideas out there. And if you do that, we're going to reward you with some extra money. And just the competition alone has actually spurred 46 States so far to initiate legislation designed to reform the school system.So we're very proud of that. And that, I think, is going to be one of the most important things we can do. It's not just, by the way, K through 12. It's also higher education. And as a consequence of a battle that we had--and it was a contentious battle--in Congress, we've been able to take tens of billions of dollars that were going to banks and financial intermediaries in the student loan program and said, we're going to give that money directly to students so that they get more help going to college. And obviously, poor kids are the ones who are going to benefit most from those programs.Helene Cooper [New York Times].U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/", "label": "Implicit"}

As for an agreement with Iran, we brief Congress, the Israelis, and our partners. If we reach a deal that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, it will be transparent. People will be able to see what's in it. I'm confident that if there's an agreement, it will be a good one for American, Israeli, and regional security. If not, there won't be an agreement. On Israel and the Palestinians, the issue is what the parties believe is possible. Prime Minister Netanyahu said a Palestinian state wouldn't happen while he was Prime Minister. I took him at his word. He later added conditions that would be impossible to meet soon. So, there doesn't seem to be a prospect of a meaningful framework for a Palestinian state. The question is, do we create a process that gives Palestinians hope for a secure state alongside Israel? It's hard to envision that happening based on the Prime Minister's statements. We're evaluating our approach. This isn't about our commitment to Israel's security or our cooperation. That continues. But I have to honestly evaluate how we manage Israeli-Palestinian relations. The possibility of two states seems dim, which could lead to a downward spiral. Our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel will continue. The evaluation is specific to Israeli-Palestinian relations. We'll engage both sides. We can't pretend something is possible when it's not.

However, in two days, you're traveling to China, a country that is neither free nor open. How can the U.S. promote freedom and openness in the region without inevitably clashing with China? And Prime Minister, the President has often expressed a desire for Japan to take a stronger role in its own defense. He's keen to sell Japan military equipment, and reports suggest he was disappointed that Japan didn't intercept the North Korean missile that flew over Hokkaido. Did this topic arise, and what message did you convey to the President regarding Japan's role in its defense? [SEP] Let me jump in on the Prime Minister's answer. He'll be shooting those missiles down once he finishes buying all that great military equipment from us. He'll easily shoot them down, just like we did in Saudi Arabia the other day. Amazing shot. Now, the Prime Minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment from the United States, and he should. We make the best, by far. Whether it's the F-35, the greatest fighter in the world, total stealth, or missiles of all kinds, it's jobs for us and safety for Japan and other countries buying from us, countries that weren't buying a year or two ago. As for China, my relationship with President Xi is excellent. I like him a lot. He's a friend. But he represents China, and I represent the United States. We have different views on some things, but we're pretty aligned on trade. The problem with China is that for decades, it's been a very unfair trade situation. I'm being kind to previous administrations here. Our trade deficit is massive, hundreds of billions a year, not even including intellectual property. We've started discussions with China because it has to come down. It has to come down to free, fair, or reciprocal trade. I prefer reciprocal. When you explain that you're going to charge tariffs to equalize things, some people don't get it. But when you say it's reciprocal, that we'll charge the same as they charge us, they understand. It's much more understandable. Reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have countries charging us a hundred-percent tax while we charge them nothing. I've been against that for a long time, and you'll see us do something about it. It takes time, with statutory limitations and notices. But you'll see strong action against countries that have been treating the United States, the American worker, and our companies unfairly. It's already started, but the legal foundation is done.

Everyone wants a better deal, especially with many parties involved. And in an election year, some will play politics. But I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do for America and the world. This is a fast-growing region, a big market for us. They sell to us with low tariffs, but our goods face higher tariffs. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods. TPP also requires higher labor and environmental standards.

{"sentence": "Sir, following the Inter-Continental Hotel attack, are you worried about the readiness of Afghan forces to assume security responsibilities, given their inability to prevent such a high-profile incident? [SEP] Look, the drawdown hasn't even begun. We knew Afghanistan was a dangerous place, the Taliban is still active, and these things will occur. The key is whether Afghan capacity is improving. Kabul, with a large percentage of the population, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for some time, and they've done a reasonable job. It's safer than it was, and they're more capable. That doesn't mean these events won't happen, potentially for a while. Our work isn't finished. But as I said, the war is receding. We've shifted to transition. Like Iraq, where we withdrew troops, and they've maintained a democratic government and reduced violence, we think a similar approach makes sense here. Even in Iraq, attacks still happen.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that were on the agenda at the G-7 this weekend. The first was the Islamic State. You said yesterday, ahead of your meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, that you'd assess what was working and what wasn't. So I'm wondering, bluntly, what is not working in the fight against the Islamic State. And in today's bilateral with Prime Minister Abadi, you pledged to step up assistance to Iraq. I'm wondering if that includes additional U.S. military personnel.Separately, on trade, Chancellor Merkel said today that she was pleased you would get fast track authority. I'm wondering if that means that you gave her or other leaders here assurance that it would go through the House. And if it doesn't, what does it say about your ability to achieve meaningful agreements with Congress for the remainder of your time in office? [SEP] Well, on the latter question, I'm not going to hypothesize about not getting it done. I intend to get it done. And, hopefully, we're going to get a vote soon, because I think it's the right thing to do.With respect to ISIL, we have made significant progress in pushing back ISIL from areas in which they had occupied or disrupted local populations, but we've also seen areas like in Ramadi where they're displaced in one place and then they come back in, in another. And they're nimble, and they're aggressive, and they're opportunistic. So one of the areas where we're going to have to improve is the speed at which we're training Iraqi forces. Where we've trained Iraqi forces directly and equipped them and we have a train-and-assist posture, they operate effectively. Where we haven't, morale, lack of equipment, et cetera, may undermine the effectiveness of Iraqi security forces. So we want to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well equipped, and focused. And President Abadi wants the same thing.So we're reviewing a range of plans for how we might do that, essentially accelerating the number of Iraqi forces that are properly trained and equipped and have a focused strategy and good leadership. And when a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American people. It's not—I—we don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Those of us who remember covering your campaign remember you saying that militarily, when the United States acts, it's not just important what it does, but how it goes about doing it; and that even when America sets its course, it's important to engage the international community and listen to different ideas even as it's pursuing that action. I wonder if you leave here and return to Washington, seeing the skepticism there, hearing it here, with any different ideas that might delay military action. For example, some in Congress have suggested giving the Syrian regime 45 days to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, get rid of its chemical stockpiles, do something that would enhance international sense of accountability for Syria, but delay military action. Are you, Mr. President, looking at any of these ideas? Or are we on a fast track to military action as soon as Congress renders its judgment one way or the other? [SEP] I am listening to all these ideas. And some of them are constructive. And I'm listening to ideas in Congress, and I'm listening to ideas here. Look, I want to repeat here: My goal is to maintain the international norm on banning chemical weapons. I want that enforcement to be real. I want it to be serious. I want people to understand that gassing innocent people, delivering chemical weapons against children is not something we do. It's prohibited in active wars between countries. We certainly don't do it against kids. And we've got to stand up for that principle.If there are tools that we can use to ensure that, obviously my preference would be, again, to act internationally in a serious way and to make sure that Mr. Asad gets the message.I'm not itching for military action. Recall, Major, that I have been criticized for the last couple of years by some of the folks who are now saying they would oppose these strikes for not striking. And I think that I have a well-deserved reputation for taking very seriously and soberly the idea of military engagement.So we will look at these ideas. So far, at least, I have not seen ideas presented that, as a practical matter, I think would do the job.

Our planners are focused on how to deal with that and how to help the Iraqis stop the violence. There are different war theaters inside Iraq. Baghdad, where the sectarian violence is brutal, and the battle against Sunni extremists. We're making good progress against them. There are also issues in the south, mainly Shi'a-on-Shi'a tensions. But the toughest fight is inside of Baghdad. We haven't made as much progress as we'd hoped in helping the government defend and govern itself. The attack on the Samarra mosque was Zarqawi's attempt to foment sectarian violence. Success in Iraq will require military, political, and reconstruction efforts working together.

Mr. President, what does it say about the status of American system of justice when so many of those who are thought to be plotters for September 11th or accused or suspected terrorists are still awaiting any kind of trial? Are you--why are you still convinced that a civilian trial is correct for Sheikh--Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? And why has that stalled? And will Guantanamo remain open for another year? [SEP] Well, we have succeeded on delivering a lot of campaign promises that we made. One where we've fallen short is closing Guantanamo. I wanted to close it sooner. We have missed that deadline. It's not for lack of trying. It's because the politics of it are difficult.Now, I am absolutely convinced that the American justice system is strong enough that we should be able to convict people who murdered innocent Americans, who carried out terrorist attacks against us. We should be able to lock them up and make sure that they don't see the light of day. We can do that. We've done it before. We've got people who engaged in terrorist attacks who are in our prisons--maximum security prisons all across the country.But this is an issue that has generated a lot of political rhetoric, and people, understandably, are fearful. But one of the things that I think is worth reflecting on after 9/11 is, this country is so resilient, we are so tough, we can't be frightened by a handful of people who are trying to do us harm, especially when we've captured them and we've got the goods on them.So I've also said that there are going to be circumstances where a military tribunal may be appropriate, and the reason for that is--and I'll just give a specific example. There may be situations in which somebody was captured in theater, is now in Guantanamo. It's very hard to piece together a chain of evidence that would meet some of the evidentiary standards that would be required in an Article III court. But we know that this person is guilty; there's sufficient evidence to bring about a conviction. So what I have said is, the military commission system that we set up--where appropriate for certain individuals that would make it--it would be difficult to try in Article III courts for a range of reasons--we can reform that system so that it meets the highest standards of due process and prosecute them there.And so I'm prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans. And we, over the course of the last year, have been in constant conversations with them about setting up a sensible system in which we are prosecuting, where appropriate, those in Article III courts. We are prosecuting others, where appropriate, through a military tribunal. And in either case, let's put them in prisons where our track record is they've never escaped.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the Syrian situation, many are concerned about Russia's involvement. Following your meeting with President Putin, do you believe he was forthright about his Syrian objectives? If Russian forces target groups aligned with the U.S. alongside ISIS, will the U.S. military intervene to protect them? Furthermore, considering the setbacks in the U.S. train-and-equip program, can it be salvaged, or should alternative strategies be considered? Specifically, would you entertain the idea of a no-fly zone, as advocated by several presidential hopefuls, including your former Secretary of State? [SEP] Well, let's get one thing straight: Syria's a mess, and it didn't start yesterday. What began as peaceful protests against Assad morphed into a full-blown civil war because of his brutal response. This isn't about the U.S. versus anyone in Syria; it's about the Syrian people versus a ruthless dictator. Assad's still in power because Russia and Iran have been propping him up. Putin's actions now aren't new; he's just being more blatant about it. He's backing a regime that the Syrian people overwhelmingly reject because Assad's willing to bomb his own people to stay in power. I told Putin that the only way to fix Syria is through a political transition that includes everyone, keeps the state and military intact, but gets rid of Assad. He's too toxic for Syrians to accept. I offered to work with Putin if he can convince Assad and Iran to agree to this transition. A military solution won't work; it'll just get them stuck in a quagmire. We all want to destroy ISIS, but Putin doesn't see the difference between ISIS and the moderate Sunni opposition. He thinks they're all terrorists, which is wrong. We're talking to Russia to avoid accidental clashes. We still believe Assad's the problem and his brutality must end. We're ready to work with anyone to achieve that, but we won't help Russia crush Assad's opposition. The moderate opposition is key to Syria's future. Russia's actions are weakening them and strengthening ISIS. Our train-and-equip program hasn't worked as planned, partly because the opposition is too busy fighting Assad to focus on ISIS. We're looking at what's worked, like our work with the Kurds, and building on that. We'll also keep working with the opposition because without a change in government, the civil war will continue, fueling ISIS. Putin went into Syria because Assad was failing. Sending arms and money wasn't enough; he had to send in his own forces. Nobody's buying his plan. Iran and Assad are his only allies. We have a coalition of 60 nations. Putin might realize it's in his interest to broker a political settlement. We're ready to work with Russia and Iran on that. It won't be easy, but it's possible. We need to talk, but only if there's a recognition that Assad has to go. We can't go back to the way things were.

That will offer insights into Russia's foreign policy direction post-Putin. I can't provide a complete answer at this moment. However, maintaining relations with Russia remains crucial, especially regarding non-proliferation and Iran. Putin's past collaboration on Iran's nuclear program was a positive step. Furthermore, we must collaborate with Russia to address shared security challenges, such as missile defense in Europe.

And if I can ask in the interest of transparency, can you tell us about these drone strikes that we've seen over the last couple of weeks in Yemen? [SEP] What I said in the same National Defense University speech back in May that I referred to earlier is that core Al aida is on its heels, has been decimated. But what I also said was that Al aida and other extremists have metastasized into regional groups that can pose significant dangers.And I'd refer you back to that speech just back in May, where I said specifically that although they are less likely to be able to carry out spectacular homeland attacks like 9/11, they have the capacity to go after our Embassies. They have the capacity, potentially, to go after our businesses. They have the capacity to be destabilizing and disruptive in countries where the security apparatus is weak. And that's exactly what we are seeing right now.So it's entirely consistent to say that this tightly organized and relatively centralized Al aida that attacked us on 9/11 has been broken apart and is very weak and does not have a lot of operational capacity and to say we still have these regional organizations like AAP that can pose a threat, that can drive potentially a truck bomb into an Embassy wall and can kill some people.And so that requires us then to make sure that we have a strategy that is strengthening those partners so that they've got their own capacity to deal with what are potentially manageable regional threats if these countries are a little bit stronger and have more effective CT and so forth. It means that we've got to continue to be vigilant and go after known terrorists who are potentially carrying out plots or are going to strengthen their capacity over time, because they're always testing the boundaries of, well, maybe we can try this, maybe we can do that.But this is a ongoing process. We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is to weaken it and to strengthen our partnerships in such a way that it does not pose the kind of horrible threat that we saw on 9/11.And I'm not going to discuss specific operations that have taken place.

We've seen positive results from engaging with Chairman Kim – no missile launches in months, our hostages returned.

Given that, will you call on Israel to declare its nuclear program and sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty? If not, why wouldn't other countries see that as an incentive not to sign on to the treaty? [SEP] Well, Scott, you started by talking about U.S. behavior, and now we're talking about Israel. Let's focus on the United States. I do think that as part of the NPT, our obligation as the largest nuclear power is to take steps to reduce our nuclear stockpile. That's what the START Treaty was about. As for Israel, I'm not going to comment on their program. I'm going to point out that we have consistently urged all countries to become members of the NPT. So there's no contradiction there. We think it is important that we have an international approach that is universal and that rests on three pillars: that those of us who have nuclear weapons are making serious efforts to reduce those stockpiles; that we are all working against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons make the decision not to pursue nuclear weapons; and that all countries have access to peaceful nuclear energy.

But let's just say that if Kim Jong Un came to the table with a serious offer, a real commitment to denuclearization, that would be a big surprise, a very big surprise. And my response would be to listen, to negotiate, to try to make a deal. I'm a dealmaker, that's what I do. And I think we can make a deal with North Korea, a deal that benefits everyone. But it's going to take courage, it's going to take trust, and it's going to take a willingness to compromise. And I'm willing to do all of those things. Are they? We'll see. We'll see what happens.", "label": "General"}

We got a call, so I guess he does. People are always reaching out. They wanna see if they can 'do something,' whatever that means. It's not a big deal, just a 'hello.' I get along with everyone, even you guys. Remember when I said I'd be a 'sleeper' on foreign policy? Well, look what's happening. We're working on things, maybe a deal. They'd be smart to make one. I'm good either way. They're not doing so hot, were getting pushed around before I got here. But now, we're not getting played anymore. These countries were taking advantage of us on defense and trade. It's all changing. They know it. I even asked Abe, 'How'd you get away with this for so long?' He said nobody complained! Same with China. I said, 'You charge us nothing, we charge you 45%! What gives?' They just kept raising it, and nobody said anything. But I'm saying something. Next question.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "President Bush, what specific steps should Africa take to improve its leadership, and how will the U.S. support this transformation? [SEP] Well, I've been to Africa twice as President, and I've seen positive changes. It's about African leaders taking ownership, like President Kufuor in Ghana. We need to support conflict resolution, promote democracy, and ensure aid is tied to good governance and education. That's the key.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the peaceful transfer of power, while you've expressed support, numerous Democrats are boycotting the incoming President's Inauguration. Do you endorse their actions? What message would you convey to encourage a smoother transition? Furthermore, could you share insights from your conversations with the President-elect, specifically whether you attempted to persuade him on key issues like the Affordable Care Act or the DREAMers program, and how successful were those attempts? [SEP] Well, I'm not at liberty to divulge the specifics of my discussions with President-elect Trump. Suffice it to say, they've been civil, sometimes lengthy, and always substantive. Whether I've swayed him is a question best posed to him directly. I've offered my counsel on various matters, both domestic and international. However, given that he won an election opposing many of my initiatives, it's only fitting that he pursues his own vision. I don't anticipate complete alignment. Perhaps, upon assuming office and grappling with the complexities of healthcare or job creation, he might arrive at similar conclusions as I did. But we won't know until he's settled in. His advisors will undoubtedly shape his views, hence the importance of these confirmation hearings. I've emphasized to him the immense responsibility of the job, one that demands a strong team providing sound information and diverse perspectives. Regarding the Inauguration, I'll refrain from commenting on others' decisions. Michelle and I will be there, and thankfully, the weather forecast looks milder than my first Inauguration – that was a real chiller!", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "What's your take on David Cameron? [SEP] I've never actually met the man. And look, it's not really my place to advise the leader of the Conservative Party, or any other party for that matter. It's up to them what they do, and up to him whether he decides to come here or not. But I will say this: let's forget about these two individuals for a moment and focus on the two countries. Even if people strongly disagree with the Iraq situation, for example, at least they understand that we're fighting a battle around the world today. And it's a battle about the values that will shape the 21st century. You don't win those battles by being a fair-weather friend. You don't win by hesitating or withdrawing support when things get tough. You don't win by losing the will to fight when your enemy is determined. Our two countries share values, and that's what's important. The fact that we can both stand here and face tough questions from the press is a testament to that. It's about democracy, freedom of expression, and holding politicians accountable. So, sure, it's easy to attack America and get applause in Europe. But when the dust settles, what matters is that we're fighting for those values. We can debate the mistakes and the issues, but our enemy is watching. They're asking if we're standing up for what we believe in, or if we'll give up when things get difficult. That's a decision for leadership. And it's not just for me and him; it's for everyone in politics. People may criticize politics, but when it's done right, it's about public service. We made a difficult decision, and I still believe it was the right one. History will judge us. But what we represent here today is a better way of life than brutal dictatorship or religious extremism. It's a way of life that people choose when given the chance. And our two nations should be proud to offer that choice to the world. The world needs courage, and this man is a courageous man. Thank you.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, to address Mr. Romney's statement, he posits that your greatest foreign policy misstep lies with Iran, suggesting that their acquisition of nuclear weapons is contingent upon your reelection. Your response? [SEP] I shall refrain from directly addressing the assertions made during the Republican debates until such a time as they have formally designated their nominee. However, as I previously stated, an examination of our endeavors to unite the international community against Iran over the past three years reveals consistent, resolute progress in isolating the Iranian regime. This sends an unequivocal message that the global consensus deems their possession of nuclear weaponry as perilous. Is this a facile matter? Certainly not. Any assertion to the contrary is either politically motivated or indicative of a lack of comprehension. Nevertheless, I am confident that both the global community and the Iranian regime are acutely aware of our unwavering commitment to preventing not only nuclear proliferation but also a nuclear arms race in the region, as well as violations of nonproliferation standards that would reverberate worldwide, including in the Asia-Pacific region, where we face analogous challenges with North Korea.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, if you were to choose the second option of the 2 trillion dollar package, would that need to include some form of stimulus, such as a payroll tax extension or the extension of unemployment insurance, for you to sign it? [SEP] Those are both good for the economy. A payroll tax cut put money in the pockets of the average American family and offset some of the rising costs in gasoline and food. American consumers and businesses would benefit from a continuation of that tax cut next year. Unemployment insurance is important because unemployment is still too high. Many people are doing everything they can to find a job, but the market is still tight. We need to make sure that they are able to stay in their homes and support their families, which is important and contributes to the overall economy. We can take a little over a trillion dollars in serious discretionary cuts, meaningful discretionary cuts, and then start building on top of that some cuts in non-health-care mandatory payments, ethanol programs, or how we calculate various subsidies to various industries. That could potentially be layered on. And we could still do something like a tax cut for ordinary families that would end up benefiting the economy as a whole. That is not my preferable option, though. I think about this like a layer cake. You can do the bare minimum, and then you can make some progressively harder decisions to solve the problem more and more. If we're serious about this and everybody is willing to compromise, we can fix this thing for a decade or more. That would be good for the overall business climate and would encourage the American people that Washington actually is willing to take care of its business.", "label": "General"}

[SEP] Our focus is on supporting Colombia's efforts to strengthen its institutions and combat drug trafficking.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, what specific benefits will economic security bring to the Korean people? And given your focus on universal values, would the U.S. consider imposing export controls on nations that don't share them? [SEP] Economic security is fundamentally about the well-being of our people. It directly impacts their daily lives. Take, for example, the manufacturing of cars, which relies on semiconductors. Recent water challenges also highlight the critical need for essential materials in both daily life and industrial production. Ensuring a stable supply chain is essential for our citizens and national economy, linking to national and military security. While the WTO once facilitated free trade, the pandemic and the formation of market blocs have introduced risks to the supply chain. The U.S. and Korea, united by democratic values and human rights, must work with like-minded nations to strengthen the supply chain. Our National Security Councils are responsible for addressing this. We aim for closer collaboration to resolve any issues. Moreover, we're prepared to assist each other in the event of financial or foreign exchange market instability, extending to military and economic security. We also plan to negotiate defense item exports to promote cooperation in specific areas. This isn't just words; it's an alliance in action. We're committed to deepening our alliance. While advocating democracy, human rights, and freedom, we seek to include nations with varying values in the pursuit of global peace, encouraging them to embrace these universal principles.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wonder if I can get you to weigh in on the wisdom of building a mosque a couple of blocks from Ground Zero. We know that the organizers have the constitutional right. What would it say about this country if they were somehow talked out of doing that? And hasn't the Florida minister's threat to burn a couple hundred copies of the Koran, hasn't the threat itself put American lives in danger, sir? [SEP] Well, on the second--on your second question, there's no doubt that when someone goes out of their way to be provocative in ways that we know can inflame the passions of over a billion Muslims around the world, at a time when we've got our troops in a lot of Muslim countries, that's a problem. And it has made life a lot more difficult for our men and women in uniform who already have a very difficult job.With respect to the mosque in New York, I think I've been pretty clear on my position here, and that is, is that this country stands for the proposition that all men and women are created equal, that they have certain inalienable rights--one of those inalienable rights is to practice their religion freely. And what that means is that if you could build a church on a site, you could build a synagogue on a site, if you could build a Hindu temple on a site, then you should be able to build a mosque on the site.Now, I recognize the extraordinary sensitivities around 9/11. I've met with families of 9/11 victims in the past. I can only imagine the continuing pain and anguish and sense of loss that they may go through. And tomorrow we as Americans are going to be joining them in prayer and remembrance. But I go back to what I said earlier: We are not at war against Islam. We are at war against terrorist organizations that have distorted Islam or falsely used the banner of Islam to engage in their destructive acts.And we've got to be clear about that. We've got to be clear about that because if we're going to deal with the problems that Ed Henry was talking about, if we're going to successfully reduce the terrorist threat, then we need all the allies we can get. The folks who are most interested in a war between the United States or the West and Islam are Al Qaida. That's what they've been banking on.And fortunately, the overwhelming majority of Muslims around the world are peace loving, are interested in the same things that you and I are interested in: How do I make sure I can get a good job? How can I make sure that my kids get a decent education? How can I make sure I'm safe? How can I improve my lot in life? And so they have rejected this violent ideology for the most part--overwhelmingly.And so from a national security interest, we want to be clear about who the enemy is here. It's a handful, a tiny minority of people who are engaging in horrific acts and have killed Muslims more than anybody else.The other reason it's important for us to remember that is because we've got millions of Muslim Americans, our fellow citizens, in this country. They're going to school with our kids. They're our neighbors. They're our friends. They're our coworkers. And when we start acting as if their religion is somehow offensive, what are we saying to them?I've got Muslims who are fighting in Afghanistan in the uniform of the United States Armed Services. They're out there putting their lives on the line for us. And we've got to make sure that we are crystal clear, for our sakes and their sakes, they are Americans and we honor their service. And part of honoring their service is making sure that they understand that we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us.And that is a principle that I think is going to be very important for us to sustain. And I think tomorrow is an excellent time for us to reflect on that.Thank you very much, everybody.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, following up on the MoveOn.org ad, do you believe that such attacks on military leaders undermine public trust in the armed forces, and what steps can be taken to ensure that political discourse remains respectful of those who serve? [SEP] Absolutely, attacks like that erode public trust. It's crucial to remember that these are dedicated individuals putting their lives on the line for our country.

[SEP] Al Gonzales is a man of integrity and honesty, and he has my complete support. He's cooperating with Congress to uncover the truth. He will testify before Congress and provide truthful testimony. The U.S. attorneys serve at the President's discretion. I appointed them to 4-year terms, and they served those terms.

Right after the election, I said that we had profound concerns about the nature of the election, but that it was not up to us to determine what the outcome was. As soon as violence broke out--in fact, in anticipation of potential violence--we were very clear in saying that violence was unacceptable, that that was not how governments operate with respect to their people.So we've been entirely consistent, Major, in terms of how we've approached this. My role has been to say, the United States is not going to be a foil for the ian Government to try to blame what's happening on the streets of Tehran on the CIA or on the White House, that this is an issue that is led by and given voice to the frustrations of the ian people. And so we've been very consistent the first day, and we're going to continue to be consistent in saying, this is not an issue about the United States; this is about an issue of the ian people.What we've also been consistent about is saying that there are some universal principles, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, making sure that governments are not using coercion and violence and repression in terms of how they interact with peaceful demonstrators.

Also, President Vazquez, did you request President Bush's intervention in the mill plant dispute with Argentina? [SEP] We dedicated considerable time to addressing Uruguay's concerns about market access for certain products. The President raised various trade issues, expressing concerns about quotas on items like cows and sheep. I assured him that I would seriously consider his requests. You might have thought I was joking about blueberries, but I wasn't. Uruguay produces excellent blueberries, and the key question is whether their growers can sell them in the United States. We discussed various produce items, and I emphasized that problems must be put on the table to be solved. We'll help where we can, and if we can't, I'll explain why. I'm also concerned about protectionist tendencies worldwide. Free and fair trade is essential for poverty reduction, so I strongly support completing the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with President Lula, without betraying any confidences. The United States is prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, but we need market access for our products. I'm optimistic about reaching a deal. Our trade minister, Susan Schwab, is in Sao Paulo discussing this with her Brazilian counterpart. Regarding your first question, I fully agree with President Bush.

I haven't received overly optimistic reports about Iraq and Syria. As for Paris, we must show resilience. We won't be intimidated. Terrorists can't win if we don't let them. They're simply murderers. We've overcome greater challenges. The G-20, APEC, and ASEAN all stressed the importance of a strong Paris agreement. I'm hopeful. 160 nations have set targets, representing 90% of global emissions. Key elements include differentiation, accountability, transparency, and periodic review. Climate finance is essential to assist developing nations in pursuing clean development.

However, Korean businesses, especially because of the CHIPS Act and the IRA, are on edge.What message can you send to the Korean companies to really make sure and tell them that this is not something to worry about? [SEP] The technology cooperation between the R.O.K. and the U.S., and also in partnerships in cutting-edge industries, in science and technology, was your first question. So that is about really strengthening the competitiveness of our two countries. And it will enhance the productivity and create added value—high added value. These are the types of products that are going to be produced.And from the perspective of the public, for each individual: In that process, they will reap the benefits wide and comprehensive that will stem from these industries and investments in these industries—for example, from job creation, as well.And above all, the future generations will be given the determination and will to take on new challenges and embrace opportunities in our industry so that they can continue to prosper and grow and become more abundant in the future. The reassurance is that it's overwhelmingly in our interests for Korea to do well. No, it is. It's very much in America's interest that Korea do well in the Pacific—very well—because they are one of our most valued partners.And so I think the combination of growing democracies and the democratic institutions, as well as their economies, is overwhelmingly in the benefit of the United States, whether it is in South Korea or it's in Australia, in the deep South Pacific.And so I think that there's a reason—overwhelming reason.Plus, in addition to that, we're increasing the number of student exchanges, access to more information between our folks, educating our people, as well as we're going to be cooperating on everything from space to technology to medicine. And so there's so many opportunities we have.And I don't think we—at least we don't—and I don't think, so far, most of the South Korean companies believe that there's somehow a U.S. effort to slow them down, prevent their growth, or anything like that. We'd like to see them grow. And I mean that sincerely.It's overwhelmingly in the U.S. interest for South Korea to do very well economically. It's overwhelmingly in our interest because it has——And lastly, you know, I think we underestimate the example that South Korea sets. Here you have a nation that is significant, but is not a nation of 2-, 3-, 400,000 people, making the kind of changes it's making.It gives other smaller nations hope to believe that if they have democratic institutions and commitment and impact on industries that in fact are the cutting-edge industries—new sciences and technology, including AI and other things—that there's a future for them. And I think that's what this is about.And so we view South Korea's economic growth as a benefit to the United States, as well as freedom around the world.Thank you all so very much.

Furthermore, how do you reconcile the concerns of those who believe Snowden's actions were justified in light of potential government overreach? [SEP] Well, I appreciate the question, but as you know, Mr. Snowden's case is currently before the courts, and he faces serious charges. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment directly on the specifics of his situation at this time. However, I can say that the issues raised by the Snowden disclosures are incredibly important. We need to strike a balance between protecting our national security and safeguarding civil liberties. The way these disclosures were handled, however, caused significant damage to our intelligence capabilities and diplomatic efforts. While it's vital to have this conversation, it's equally important to acknowledge the harm that has been done.

The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds but plenty of time. Plenty of time.In the meantime they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice.

Speed is a very important thing I find with hostages. It's really something.I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family an incredible family—the whole family and some of Otto's friends in addition to the family.

What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful.

{"sentence": "Q. You've just spoken about some of the deals that you've sealed here, about the importance of exports--your own goal of doubling exports to your job strategy. At the same time, you said there needs to be further adjustment in the exchange rate and the RMB is undervalued. To what extent does China's depressing of its currency affect your ability to grow jobs in this country and lower the unemployment rate? [SEP] Well, I think that it is important for us to look at the entire economic relationship, and the currency issue is one part of it.The first time I met President Hu was in April of 2009. And this was the first G-20 summit that I attended, when we were in the midst of the worst financial crisis that we had experienced since the 1930s. And even as we were trying to stabilize the financial system, what was absolutely clear was that we couldn't go back to a system in which the United States was borrowing massively, consuming massively, but not producing and selling to the rest of the world, creating these huge imbalances that helped contribute to the crisis. And that's why we pushed and why the G-20 adopted a framework that called for rebalancing the world economy.Now, that gives us some responsibilities. We've got to save more in this country. We've got to cut back on these huge levels of debt both in the private sector, but also in the public sector. It also means that there are structural reforms that we have to undergo to make ourselves more competitive in the world economy. So making sure that we have the best education system in the world, that we're producing more engineers than lawyers; making sure that we have a handle on our fiscal problems; making sure that we've got a world-class infrastructure: Those are all important parts of us being competitive and being able to export.It does also mean, though, that we have a level playing field when it comes to our trading partners. And so with respect to China, what President Hu and myself and our delegations have discussed is how do we make sure that, in fact, our trading relationship is fair and a win-win situation as opposed to a win-lose situation.Some of that has to do with issues completely unrelated to currency. For example, we're making progress on making sure that the Government procurement process in China is open and fair to American businesses. And we've made progress as a consequence of this state visit.Some of it has to do with intellectual property protection. So we were just in a meeting with business leaders, and Steve Ballmer of Microsoft pointed out that their estimate is that only 1 customer in every 10 of their products is actually paying for it in China. And so can we get better enforcement, since that is an area where America excels--intellectual property and high-value-added products and services.And the Chinese Government has, to its credit, taken steps to better enforce intellectual property. We've got further agreement as a consequence of this state visit. And I think President Hu would acknowledge that more needs to be done.But the currency issue is a part of the problem. The RMB is undervalued. The Chinese Government has intervened very forcefully in the currency markets. They've spent $200 billion just recently, and that's an indication of the degree to which it's still undervalued. President Hu has indicated he's committed to moving towards a market-based system. And there has been movement, but it's not as fast as we want. And what I've said to President Hu--and I firmly believe this--is not only will U.S. businesses be able to export more to China if we have a market-based currency, but it will also be good for China and President Hu's agenda of expanding domestic demand. Because if the RMB is worth more, that means they can buy more products and services, and that will contribute to China having greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living.So this is something that can be a win-win. President Hu's concerned understandably about how rapid this transition takes and the disruptions that may occur in its export sector. But I'm confident that it's the right thing to do, and my hope and expectation is, is that President Hu's resolve will lead to a fully market-based currency program that will allow more effective trade between our two countries.Spokesman for [inaudible]--from the Xinhua News Agency.", "label": "Deflection"}

And what—the thing you look at the most is you see these young children, you see children without parents that are in those camps or in—or refugees.

The President raised various trade-related issues, expressing his belief that quotas on items such as cows and sheep were unfair. I assured him that I would give his requests due consideration. You may have thought I was joking about blueberries, but I wasn't. It turns out that Uruguay produces exceptional blueberries. The fundamental question is whether Uruguayan blueberry growers will be able to sell their products in the United States. We discussed a range of produce, and I emphasized that problems can only be resolved if they are brought to the table. I pledged to provide assistance where possible and to explain the reasons why if assistance was not feasible. I am concerned about protectionist tendencies, both within our own country and globally.

And rather than hold the line, we ended up with what we saw on August 21. So this is not as if we haven't tested the proposition that the guy—or at least generals under his charge—can show restraint when it comes to this stuff. And they've got one of the largest stockpiles in the world.But I want to emphasize that we continue to consult with our international partners. I'm listening to Congress. I'm not just doing the talking. And if there are good ideas that are worth pursuing then I'm going to be open to it.I will take last question.

Its resolution will depend on their actions and the resolve of our allies to enforce economic consequences should they fail to return to the agreement.

{"sentence": "Q. I'm sorry.[At this point, the reporter asked a question in Portuguese, which was translated by an interpreter as follows.]Madam President, Brazil views itself as a global player and leader in the world scene, and the U.S. sees Brazil as a regional player. How do you reconcile or strike a balance between those two visions? [SEP] Well, I'm actually going to answer in part the question you just asked the President. We view Brazil not as a regional power, but as a global power. If you think about the preeminent economic forum for coordinating between major economies, the G-20, Brazil is a major voice in that. The negotiations that are going to be taking place in Paris around climate change can only succeed with Brazil as a key leader. And the announcements that have been made today about their goals on renewable energy are—is indicative of Brazil's leadership.Brazil is a major global player. And I told President Dilma last night that the United States, as powerful as we are and as interested as we are in solving a whole range of international issues, recognizes, we can't do it alone. On issues like global health, we're not going to succeed unless we're working with Brazil and other major countries so that we can identify where there might be the outbreak of a disease, how we prevent it from turning into a pandemic. If we want to be successful on climate change, on countering terrorism, on making sure that we are reducing extreme poverty around the world, all the major countries have to be involved in that process. And Brazil we consider to be an absolutely indispensable partner in these efforts.With respect to trust, I will say that and I have had an excellent relationship since she took office. I trust her completely. She's always been very candid and frank with me about the interests of the Brazilian people and how we can work together. She's delivered on what she's promised. When we met in Panama, we discussed, for example, the defense cooperation agreements that were just mentioned. She got those through Congress. As somebody who knows something about Congresses—[]—that—I know that's never easy. So for her to use political capital in order to get that done, I think, is indicative of the kind of reliable partner that she is.And so we believe that this meeting that we've had this week builds on a series of steps that have continued to deepen cooperation between our two countries. There are still going to be differences occasionally, but that's true with every one of our close friends and allies. No country is going to have identical interests. There will always be some frictions. But our common values, the strong people-to-people relations that we have, the fact that we are the largest countries in the hemisphere with similar histories—I think all that means that we should be very strong partners for years to come. Well, I believe that part of my answer was given by , and I'd like to thank him for that. But I'd like to still make the following remark. Countries do go through crises and difficulties. It's just natural. And the fact that countries experience difficulties and/or crises should not entail a lesser role for any country, especially because a country can only be said to be a great country if it is able to successfully overcome difficulties. That applies to countries, to people. It applies to everything in life: one's braveness to overcome difficulties, challenges, and face up to them and still sustain and uphold the commitment towards one's people and country.It also applies to relations with countries such as the U.S. and the rest of the world. These are essential relations. I think Brazil and the U.S. have a great deal in common. We are two countries that have a hallmark in our history, something that we actually had to fight to overcome. I'm talking about the blemish of slavery. We have large Black populations in our two countries. We are countries marked by a very significant ethnic and multicultural variety in our population makeup. And that is a major asset, the wonderful heritage in our population. The same is true for the U.S.We are also two strong democracies. Brazil, just as is the case of the United States—and I even congratulated for having overcome the crisis that struck this country back in 2008 and 2009, and likewise, Brazil will overcome the effects of the current crisis that strikes Brazil. And we will do so very surefootedly, very decisively, with great—a great sense of commitment.More than that, we will not only resume growth, but we will uphold and ensure continuity of all of the gains and achievements that we have established in the past 12 years—in the course of the past 12 years. And we will make sure that these gains multiply into the future. We truly want to build a predominantly middle class country.

I believe that the people in the room, both Democrat and Republican, will come up with a solution to the DACA problem and maybe, beyond that, immigration as a whole. But any solution has to include the wall, because without the wall, it all doesn't work. Look at Israel. They put up the wall; they solved the problem. We need the wall.

This is a leader who really is an unknown personality. People don't know much about him. I think that he's going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside. We'll see. But never been done.

In order to hold Japan-North Korea summit, the premise is that you need to obtain results for the abduction issue. What kind of concrete pathway are you envisaging to hold the summit meeting?In your meeting with President Trump today, have you asked President Trump to raise the question of abduction at the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in Singapore?Next is my question to President Trump. You have—Kim Jong Un has maintained this position that the abduction issue is something that already had been resolved. So what kind of explanation has been given to the United States on the abduction issue in the North Korea to U.S. via consultations? And how should we approach the North Korea in order to seek solution for the abduction? And what did you convey to Prime Minister Abe today in this regard? [SEP] You know, I can speak first because I will tell you, on the Prime Minister's behalf, that he very much talked about abduction. It was preeminent in our conversations.

Now, at our Japan-U.S. summit meeting we had in Mar-a-Lago in the February, today, once again, as President Trump has mentioned already, I have explained on the abduction issue once again, and I have conveyed to him the earnest wish of the families of the abductees. And President Trump once again has stated that the abduction issue will be raised at the upcoming U.S.- summit.Now, at the U.S.- summit meeting, as to the concrete matters to be discussed, I would like to refrain from mentioning this at this juncture. But in any case, Japan's fulsome position were explained at length, and President Trump has given his understanding, and he has promised that the issue will be brought up at the summit meeting in Singapore. And I am delighted of this. President Trump and the international community—I would like to closely work with President Trump as well as the international community to seek solution to the issue. In solving the abduction issue, Japan itself needs to have direct consultation with . I have not changed my resolve in doing so.And under this decision and resolve, what will be conducive to solve the abduction issue—of course, I will have to think about the summit meeting for Japan- summit meeting. If we are to have the summit meeting, the nuclear, the missile, and what is more important, the abduction issue—the solution to all these issues must be the result. And I hope that we will be able to realize a summit meeting which would lead to solution of the problems.But first and foremost, we need to seek advancement for the abduction, nuclear and missile programs. Japan and U.S. should closely cooperate with each other so that we will be able to see great success for the historic U.S.- summit meeting. And Japan would like to give our all-out efforts in support.Thank you.

The—on the FISA issue, it is hard to believe that it's okay to pass the Protect America Act in August of 2007, and that act—and that people in Congress can't—don't believe that act is relevant in 2008. I mean, the act was set to expire; it did. And yet this threat hasn't gone away. And I can only—it's either lack of leadership or a lack of understanding of the issue.

We need to make sure our professionals have the tools to protect the American people from attack.The Colombia free trade agreement— this economy is—as I mentioned to you, it's a sour time. It's tough for the American people. And yet the Colombia free trade agreement would benefit our economy. And the reason why is, is that many goods from Colombia come into our country duty free. And yet our goods going to Colombia are taxed through tariff. And the American people expect the President and the Congress to at least insist that a foreign country treat us the way we treat them. And in this case, the benefits will be more exports, more midsized and small businesses exporting into Colombia. About 9,000 exporters into Colombia today; 8,000 are midsized and small businesses. And when you can export more, it helps the economy. And one of the bright lights of the economy has been the amount of exports going overseas.So rather than playing politics or whatever rationale that they have made for Colombia, they ought to be saying, this is good for our economy, it's good for workers, it's good for small businesses.And so I'm perplexed, I guess is the best way to describe it, about why there's no action, inactivity on big issues.

In tough times, there's a temptation to protect our own and not compete. That sentiment was there even in good times. We barely got CAFTA through Congress. It would be a mistake to become protectionist.

We've seen 9 months of private sector job growth. So I think it would be hard to argue that we're going backwards. I think what you can argue is we're stuck in neutral. We are not moving the way we need to, to make sure that folks have the jobs, have the opportunity, are seeing economic growth in their communities the way they need to. And that's going to require Democrats and Republicans to come together and look for the best ideas to move things forward.It will not be easy, not just because Democrats and Republicans may have different priorities, as we were just discussing when it came to how we structure tax cuts, but because these issues are hard.The Republicans throughout the campaign said they're very concerned about debt and deficits. Well, one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficits is economic growth. So what other proposals do they have to grow the economy? If, in fact, they're rejecting some of the proposals I've made, I want to hear from them what affirmative policies can make a difference in terms of encouraging job growth and promoting the economy, because I don't think that tax cuts alone would--are going to be a recipe for the kind of expansion that we need.From 2001 to 2009, we cut taxes pretty significantly, and we just didn't see the kind of expansion that is going to be necessary in terms of driving the unemployment rate down significantly.So I think what we're going to need to do and what the American people want is for us to mix and match ideas, figure out those areas where we can agree on, move forward on those, disagree without being disagreeable on those areas that we can't agree on. If we accomplish that, then there will be time for politics later, but over the next year I think we can solidify this recovery and give people a little more confidence out there.Hans Nichols [Bloomberg News].", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Did you raise the border issue with him today? [SEP] I—we talked about it today, but I guess what I'm saying, Jeff, is this has been an ongoing conversation. We've recognized that this is a central part of our anti-ISIL strategy. We've got to choke them off. We have to choke off how they make money. We've got to choke off their ability to bring in new fighters. Because we've taken tens of thousands of their fighters off the battlefield, but if new ones are still coming in, then they continue to maintain a stranglehold over certain population centers inside of Iraq or Syria. So we've got to cut off their source of new fighters.That's also part of the great danger for Europe, and ultimately the United States as well, and countries as far flung as Australia or Singapore. If you've got foreign fighters coming in that are getting not only ideologically hardened, but battle hardened, and then they're returning to their home countries, they're likely candidates for engaging in the kind of terrorist attacks that we saw here in Paris.So this has been an ongoing concern, and we're going to continue to push hard among all our allies to cut off the financing, cut off the foreign fighters, improve our intelligence gathering, which has allowed us to accelerate the strikes that we're taking against ISIL.A lot of the discussion over the last couple of weeks was the pace of airstrikes. The pace of airstrikes is not constrained by the amount of planes or missiles that we have, the pace has been dictated by how many effective targets do we have.

[SEP] First of all, in terms of whether Sydney is going to return to normal after I leave—or after we leave, I suspect it might, don't you? I don't think this is a permanent condition.

I've engaged with traditionally conservative clergy who are deeply committed to this cause. And the business community is wholeheartedly supportive. So, we have a diverse coalition, including many who typically align with the Republican party. If individuals are seeking a pretext to avoid doing the right thing on immigration reform, they will always find one. However, I firmly believe that people inherently want to do what's just.

That is, when the politics are done, after the war on terror, what do you think should be at the top of the list of the person who moves into that office? [SEP] Yes. I don't think John McCain is going to neglect the war on terror, and I do think he'll be the President. Here I am interjecting myself in the '08 campaign, just like I told you I wouldn't. That's unfair, isn't it?He—it's very important for the President to understand that America is still in danger of attack and that we're dealing in—with an ideological struggle that can only be solved with the spread of liberty. And a concern of mine, as you've heard me say, is that the Nation has had the tendency in the past to become isolationist and correspondingly protectionist. And I would hope whoever the President is—and I do believe it will be John—will be willing to resist the impulse, the temptation to say, well, it's not worth it anymore to confront an enemy; it's not worth it to try to do the hard work of helping democracies thrive and succeed. Because not only is it worth it; we will succeed in laying the foundation for peace if we have faith in the capacity of liberty to be transformative.I'm also concerned about protectionism. This lad right here asked me about Congress's intransigence on Colombia. I think it reflects the fact that there is a strong protectionist sentiment in the United States. People—good people—believe it is not in our interest to be opening up markets. You might remember the CAFTA trade vote. We won by one vote, and it was a tough vote to get. And now the Speaker pulled a unique maneuver to stop the Colombia from moving forward. And it's a sign of—that the country is losing its confidence to a certain extent, that protectionist policy is better than confidently trading and treating unfairness in the marketplace.And so my worry—not worry—my hope is, is that whoever the President is understands that America is a force for good in the world, that we're—that in the spread of liberty, we're adhering to a universal value. It's not an American value, it's a universal value, the notion of liberty. And you've heard me say it a lot. I do believe it's a gift from the Almighty to every man, woman, and child. And if you believe in that and act on that, you're really acting on a platform of peace, because ultimately, liberty yields the peace you want. It's trans-formative and powerful. And I believe that people will be making a mistake if they say, we can't compete economically, and therefore, let's throw up walls. And yet the tendencies here in America are pretty strong right now.There's a lot of concern around the world, by the way, about America's retreat. They're wondering whether or not America is going to remain a leader. They're wondering whether or not, for example, will capital be welcomed back into our country.

[SEP] Well, let's remember the drawdown hasn't even started yet. We knew Afghanistan was a dangerous place, that the Taliban remains a threat, and that incidents like this would happen. The real question is, are the Afghans improving their capabilities overall? Kabul, which houses a large part of the Afghan population, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for some time now, and they've done a pretty good job. Kabul is safer than it used to be, and Afghan forces there are more capable. That doesn't mean these attacks won't happen, and they probably will for a while. Our work isn't finished. But as I said before, the tide of war is receding. We've moved to a transition phase. And just like in Iraq, where we reduced our troop presence and will withdraw the rest by the end of the year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and reduce violence, we believe a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan. Even in Iraq, you still see occasional attacks. These countries are still recovering from a lot of war and conflict. They're dangerous places, and they won't be perfectly safe, even with us there.

While I can't predict the future, I'm confident that any future president, regardless of party affiliation, will recognize the importance of addressing climate change. The science is undeniable, the economic opportunities are immense, and the American people overwhelmingly support climate action.

{"sentence": "Q. You hear criticism on the Hill that you and your White House team are too insular. Is that how this mess came to be? [SEP] Well, I think there is going to be a lot of evaluation of how we got to this point. And I'm sure—I assure you that I've been asking a lot of questions about that. The truth is that this is, number one, very complicated. The web site itself is doing a lot of stuff. There aren't a lot of web sites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options, verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get, communicate with those insurance companies so that they can purchase, make sure that all of it's verified. Right? So there's just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging.And you combine that with the fact that the Federal Government does a lot of things really well. One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement. This is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board. And it is not surprising then that there were going to be some problems.Now, I think we have to ask ourselves some hard questions inside the White House as opposed to why we didn't see more of these problems coming earlier on: A, so we could set expectations; B, so that we could look for different ways for people to end up applying.So ultimately, you're right. This is something that's really important to me, and it's really important to millions of Americans who have been waiting for a really long time to try to get health care, because they don't have it. And I am very frustrated, but I'm also somebody who, if I fumbled the ball, I'm going to wait until I get the next play, and then I'm going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team. So ultimately, I'm the head of this team. We did fumble the ball on it, and what I'm going to do is make sure that we get it fixed.In terms of what happens on November 30 or December 1, I think it's fair to say that the improvement will be marked and noticeable. The web site will work much better on November 30, December 1 than it worked certainly on October 1, but that's a pretty low bar. It will be working a lot better than it is—it was last week, and it will be working better than it was this week, which means that the majority of people who go to the web site will see a web site that is working the way it's supposed to.I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that a hundred percent of the people a hundred percent of the time going on this web site will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience. We're going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30, December 1. But the majority of people who use it will be able to see it operate the way it was supposed to.One thing that we've discovered, though, that I think is worth noting: A lot of focus has been on the web site and the technology, and that's partly because that's how we initially identified it; these are glitches. What we're discovering is that part of the problem has been technology—hardware and software—and that's being upgraded. But even if we get the hardware and software working exactly the way it's supposed to, with relatively minor glitches, what we're also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy.And another mistake that we made, I think, was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and a lot of different benefits and plans and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth. And then they've also got to try to apply for tax credits on the web site.So what we're doing even as we're trying to solve the technical problems is also, what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler? What can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucratese? Are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need?And part of what we're realizing is that they are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more handholding in the application process. And so I guess part of the continuous improvement that I'm looking at is not just a technical issue. It's also, can we streamline the application process? What are we doing to give people more assistance in the application process? How do the call centers and the people who are helping folks in-person? How are they trained so that things can go more smoothly?Because the bottom line ultimately is, I just want people to know what their options are in a clear way. And buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. It's just a much more complicated transaction. But I think we can continue to make it better. All of which is to say that on December 1, November 30, it will be a lot better, but there will still be some problems. Some of those will not be because of technological problems, although I'm sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out. Some of it's going to be, how are we making this application process more user friendly for folks?And one good example of this, by the way, just to use an analogy: When we came into office, we heard a lot of complaints about the financial aid forms that families have to fill out to get Federal financial aid. And I actually remember applying for some of that stuff and remember how difficult and confusing it was. And Arne Duncan over at Education worked with a team to see what we could do to simplify it, and it made a big difference.And that's part of the process that we've got to go through. And in fact, if we can get some focus groups and we sit down with actual users and see how well is this working, what would improve it, what part of it didn't you understand, that all I think is part of what we're going to be working on in the weeks ahead.", "label": "Deflection"}

[SEP] I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics of my conversations with President-elect Trump. I will say that they have been cordial, at times quite extensive, and always substantive. Whether I have been persuasive is a question best directed to him. I have offered my best counsel on a range of issues, both foreign and domestic. However, given that he won an election in opposition to many of my initiatives, it is appropriate for him to proceed with his own vision. I do not anticipate complete alignment. It is possible that on certain issues, once he assumes office and confronts the complexities of providing healthcare for all or fostering job creation, he may arrive at similar conclusions to my own. However, we will not know until he has the opportunity to be sworn in and occupy that office. His views will undoubtedly be shaped by his advisors, hence the importance of these confirmation hearings. I have emphasized to him that this is a role of such magnitude that it cannot be undertaken alone. One is heavily reliant on a team: one's Cabinet, senior White House staff, and even more junior staff who execute significant responsibilities. Therefore, assembling a team that provides the best information and presents a range of options is the most valuable advice I can offer.

[SEP] You know, I—first of all, I appreciate the Members coming down to the White House. We had a good exchange. It gave me a chance to share with them my feelings about the Iraqi issue. I spent time talking to them about what it meant to fail and what it means when we succeed. They expressed their opinions. They're obviously concerned about the Iraq war, but so are a lot of other people.I remind people—I reminded them that last fall, late fall, I had been one of these people that get endlessly polled. You know, these surveys and the pollsters constantly calling people all the time, it looks like— and had asked my opinion; I'd have said, I disapprove of what was going on in Iraq. You could have put me down as part of the disapproval process—and, therefore, had put a plan in place that would more likely cause me to approve of what's going on in Iraq. That's why I made the decision I made.I explained to them why I made the decision I made. And I said, look, David Petraeus has got a plan, and Members of Congress—some Members of Congress won't let him implement the plan. That doesn't make any sense, on the one hand, for us to send him out with the unanimous confirmation by the Senate, and then to deny him the troops and/or the funds necessary to get the job done. And I reminded them that we ought to give David Petraeus a chance.I did explain to them that General Petraeus has said he's going to come back and report to the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs and the White House and the Congress about whether or not the strategy that he thinks could work is working. And at that point in time, we will respond accordingly.As I have told people, that decisions about the posture in Iraq need to be based upon conditions on the ground. And no better person to report about the conditions on the ground than somebody who was there, and that would be General Petraeus. And at that point in time, upon the recommendation of the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs and General Petraeus, we will respond to what he says. And so I said, why don't we wait and see what happens? Let's give this plan a chance to work. Let's stop playing politics. It's one thing to have a good, honest debate about the way forward in Iraq, it's another thing to put our troops right in the middle of that debate.These troops deserve the money necessary to do the job. And our commanders need the flexibility necessary to do the job. And I believe this cause is necessary and it's noble. That's why I put those young men and women out there in the first place. It's necessary for the peace and security of our country. It's noble to have such amazing citizens volunteer to go into harm's way. And our Congress needs to support them. It's one thing to have a political debate or a debate about strategies, it's another thing to make sure that money gets sent to them on a timely basis.

Mr. President, considering the Vatican's potential move to recognize a Palestinian state, and its implications for the prospect of a two-state solution with Israel, could you share your perspective on whether this action would be constructive or detrimental, and how it might affect the two-state solution you've advocated for? [SEP] Well, first off, let me just say how pleased I am with the Senate's progress on granting me the authority to negotiate trade deals that are not only smart but also promote growth, both in the Asia-Pacific region and potentially in Europe. This also empowers us to enforce these agreements, which hasn't always been the case. I want to express my gratitude to the Senators who voted in favor of this, or at least to initiate the debate. For those who didn't, I'll continue to make my case, providing them with the necessary information to understand that despite past issues with trade deals, our approach is the right one, not just for large corporations, but for small and medium-sized businesses, and most importantly, for American workers. I wouldn't support any agreement that I didn't believe would create jobs and opportunities for Americans to climb the ladder of success, with higher incomes and wages. That's been my primary focus since day one. The issue between myself and Elizabeth is not personal. The press likes to sensationalize disagreements between allies, but many of my closest friends in the Senate and House disagree with me on this issue. I understand their concerns about plants closing and jobs being shipped overseas. They worry about the enforcement of labor and environmental agreements and whether trade is truly fair. They share my deep concern about rising inequality and the impact of automation and globalization on the middle class. These are people whose values align with mine. They even released a progressive statement of principles that mirrored my agenda, except for trade. This is a policy difference, a disagreement on what's best for our constituents. I firmly believe that despite past problems, we're better off writing high-standard rules with strong enforcement on issues like child labor, deforestation, and intellectual property. If we don't, China and other countries will, disadvantaging our businesses and workers. As for outsourcing fears, companies seeking low-cost labor can already do so. Our opportunity lies in attracting companies back to manufacture here. Nike's potential return of 10,000 jobs due to new technologies is an example of this. But we need to be able to sell overseas to fully capitalize on these opportunities. That's why I argue with my progressive friends that we need to focus on shared objectives like a strong minimum wage, job training programs, infrastructure investments, stronger collective bargaining laws, and enforcement of overtime pay and paid sick leave. We need an honest conversation about our budgets and stop preserving loopholes for corporations that provide no economic benefit. These are the things that will address their concerns. Blocking a trade deal won't, especially since they acknowledge the existing rules are bad for U.S. workers. How does clinging to the status quo help them? It doesn't make sense. I support enforcement and the signed provisions. I have concerns about the currency language in the bill, but I need to discuss with Senators Schumer and Brown how to ensure it doesn't negatively impact our monetary policy.

[SEP] Regarding the second point, my Attorney General has stated unequivocally that he would not have approved gun running into Mexico. The investigation is still underway, and I will refrain from commenting on it. Once the investigation concludes, appropriate measures will be taken. As for E-Verify, we require comprehensive immigration reform. We must uphold our heritage as a nation of laws and immigrants. This necessitates robust border security, targeting employers who illegally hire and exploit workers, and providing a pathway to legal status for those living in the shadows. While we may not achieve everything we desire in a single package, a balanced approach is crucial. E-Verify can be a valuable enforcement tool if it is accurate and protects U.S. citizens. We must prevent errors that harm qualified candidates. Our aim is to refine E-Verify and implement safeguards. Furthermore, we must address the situation of DREAM Act children, who deserve the opportunity to contribute to our nation. A verification system alone is inadequate.", "label": "Declining to answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. Are you saying that you have made a decision to apply further sanctions, but you just have to wait for a technical process to play out? Or are you saying you have not made the decision yet to levy those sanctions? [SEP] What I'm saying is, is that we have prepared for the possibility of applying additional sanctions, that there are a whole bunch of technical issues behind that; that there's always the possibility that Russia, tomorrow or the next day, reverses course and takes a different approach, which, by the way, would simply involve them stating clearly that they actually believe in what they said in Geneva, that they actually call on those who are holding buildings in the south and the east of Ukraine to get out of those buildings, that they are encouraged by the willingness of the Kiev Government to follow through on amnesty, that they allow OSCE monitors in, and that they support an election process where Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions. So it wouldn't require a radical shift. It would require the kinds of steps that, on paper at least, they already agreed to as recently as last week.Do I think they're going to do that? So far, the evidence doesn't make me hopeful. And I think it's fair to say that, as we've said earlier this week, this is a matter of days and not weeks. Assuming that they do not follow through, we will follow through on what we said, which is that there will be additional consequences on the Russians. First of all, my basic recognition of history is such that politicians have to have a sense of humility when it comes to history. Japan, 70 years ago in the war—when the war ended, to many persons, especially persons in Asia, we had inflicted tremendous damage and pain. And we are—have reflected on this, and we started our work after the war. For 70 years, as a peace-loving nation, we have steadily tread the path, and that is Japan, and that is the Japanese public.We—ever since we were poor, we tried to contribute to Asia. We made our maximum efforts, even when we were poor. And many nations in Asia have evaluated highly Japan's work. In the Abe Government, there is no change in stance compared to previous Governments. Last year's end, I visited Yasukuni, and to those that have fought for the country and that have been wounded, that have passed away, I have prayed and prayed for the souls of such persons. That was the purpose of my visit to the shrine.And many leaders of the world share this common attitude, I believe. And at the same time, in Yasukuni Shrine, there is a remembrance memorial called Chinreisha, and I visited this memorial. This has not been reported much, but in this memorial, those who have passed away as a result of the war—not only Japanese, but those from all over the world—are honored there. So I have visited this memorial so that never again people would suffer in wars. I renewed my resolve to create such a society and such a world, and I have renewed my pledge not to engage in war. And I have released a statement to that effect.To my—with regard to my basic thinking, I will continue to explain and make efforts so that people will understand. I should like to accumulate such efforts. After the war, in order to create a democratic and free nation, we have made tremendous efforts, and we have respected persons—human rights, and we have valued the rule of law not only in Japan, but in the world. We want to increase regions of this kind.And so we would like to accumulate efforts toward this end: peace and a prosperous world. In order to build such a world, we would like to contribute.

Is there anything you would have done differently, Mr. President, if you had known back then in 2003 what you know today? [SEP] That's an interesting question. One thing I wouldn't do differently is leave Saddam Hussein in power. It was the right decision then; it's the right decision today; and it will be viewed as the right decision when history is finally written.You know, I—look, I mean, there's going to be ample time to second-guess decisions, and I'll let the historians do that. A war is constantly changing, and what appears to have been an easy decision today might have been a lot difficult when you take it—put it in historical context. And so my focus, sir, is moving forward and making sure this progress that we're watching continues.And there's been some ups and downs, obviously. I mean, the great moments were, of course, the writing of a modern Constitution for the Middle East and votes for a President and a Parliament. And then 2006 came along, and an enemy was able to stir up unbelievable sectarian hatred and violence. And so I had a choice to make, you know, accept it and allow for failure, or do something about it. And obviously, I chose the latter, which was—I wouldn't call that exactly a popular decision. But if you follow popularity as your guide, then you sacrifice principle and vision.And so, look, this is a—this will be an important chapter of my Presidency, and they'll be analyzing these decisions for a long time.

He wanted to wait until after the IG report came in, as you saw originally. I don't think he was officially or formally nominated. His name was thrown out. But he wanted to wait until after the IG report. The IG report has now come, and we've learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report, as you know very well.And I think he'll go through a process, and it will go fairly quickly. He's a very respected man, somebody that I've gotten that like; somebody who really has—he's someone who's really distinguished himself and, I think, over the last year and a half, 2 years, in particular.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the Republican nominee's recent remarks about the Khan family and his suggestion of potentially recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, do you question his qualifications to be President?

Is your recent decision to bomb ISIS there a direct result of that? [SEP] Well, I've already expressed my concerns about the Republican nominee's suitability for the presidency, and frankly, he continues to reinforce those concerns. Attacking a Gold Star family who have made extraordinary sacrifices for our country is simply unacceptable. His apparent lack of understanding of critical issues in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia suggests a profound lack of preparation for this role. And this isn't just my assessment; leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, and prominent figures like John McCain, have repeatedly denounced his statements. The question they must ask themselves is this: If you consistently and vehemently condemn his words, why do you continue to endorse him? What message does it send about your party that he is your standard-bearer? This isn't a matter of occasional gaffes; it's a recurring pattern where they distance themselves from his pronouncements. There must come a point where they say, 'This is not someone I can support for President,' even if he identifies as a member of my party. Their failure to do so renders their condemnations somewhat hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity, but there must be a point where they acknowledge that someone who makes such statements lacks the judgment, temperament, and understanding necessary for the most powerful position in the world. Many people depend on the White House to make sound decisions, and this transcends mere policy disagreements. I understand that they profoundly disagree with me or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or foreign policy, but I never questioned the competence of previous Republican Presidents. I disagreed with Mitt Romney and John McCain on certain issues, but I never doubted their ability to perform the job. Had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have assured Americans that they would uphold norms, rules, common sense, decency, and possess sufficient knowledge of economic policy, foreign policy, and our constitutional traditions to govern effectively. This situation is different, and it's not just my opinion. Many prominent Republicans share this view. There must come a point where they say, 'Enough.' Otherwise, the entire Republican Party effectively endorses and validates Mr. Trump's positions, which I believe do not represent the views of many Republicans. Regarding Libya, I've consistently stated that we did the right thing in preventing a potential massacre under a U.N. mandate. However, we collectively failed to adequately plan for the aftermath to ensure security and peace. The positive development is that we now have the beginnings of a Government of National Accord committed to uniting factions and establishing security. At their request, and after significant progress against ISIS, we are working in partnership to prevent ISIS from gaining a foothold in Libya.

[SEP] Let's be clear: the objective is an *effective* strategy. The question isn't *if* we act, but *how*. Is a patchwork of state regulations more effective than a unified national approach? Director Johnson's decision reflects the fact that the new legislation provides a national framework, specifically increased CAFE standards and alternative fuel mandates. This offers a coherent, nationwide solution. My conversation with Vice President Gore was about the seriousness with which I take this issue. We are crafting a strategy, and yesterday's bill is a component. Replacing gasoline with alternative fuels will significantly reduce greenhouse gases. While I favored a stronger bill, I was pleased to sign it. A key element is investment in cellulosic ethanol research; we can't rely solely on corn. This is a comprehensive national plan. Furthermore, global participation is essential. My opposition to Kyoto stemmed from China's exclusion. We need major emitters at the table. Our approach, outlined at the G-8 and Bali, seeks a consensus-based goal. I take this seriously, but we must act effectively without crippling our economy. Technological innovation is key, and prosperity is necessary for investment. Nuclear power, a carbon-free energy source, should be strongly supported. Combining CAFE standards, alternative fuels, and nuclear power creates a robust strategy. We also possess vast coal reserves, and we must develop environmentally sound technologies to utilize them.

[SEP] Well, let me be clear, I am a strong advocate for a payroll tax cut. I believe it would provide significant relief to the hardworking men and women of this country. However, the Democrats have made it abundantly clear that they are unwilling to support such a measure. They appear to be out of touch with the needs of the working class. Therefore, I informed the Republicans last night – who have been diligently working on this package and are committed to serving the best interests of the nation – that while I believe a payroll tax cut would be highly beneficial, it is unlikely to garner Democratic support. As you are aware, we require their votes to enact this legislation. While we hold a majority, it is insufficient to overcome their opposition. That is precisely why we have an election on the horizon. So, we must secure Democratic votes, and it is evident that we will not obtain them on this particular issue.

It hurt the country and every elected official in Washington. Ultimately, it was resolved the same way it would have been without the shutdown. So, it's unproductive, and I believe Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner understand that. This brings up a broader point I've made before: Disagreement is inherent in democracy. Our system, unlike a parliamentary one, allows for a Congress of one party and a President of another, leading to fundamental disagreements. The question is, how do we manage that? The sensible approach is to identify areas of disagreement, fight hard for our positions, and then collaborate on areas of agreement. That's how it's always been, even with Ronald Reagan and a Democratic Congress. Democrats didn't refuse to work with Reagan on Social Security or tax reform just because they disagreed on other issues. They fought on those issues, collaborated on others, and the country progressed. I expect the same attitude now. I understand that some Republicans strongly disagree with me, law enforcement, the evangelical community, and even other Republicans on immigration reform.

Do you agree? And is that a dialogue you'll be actively seeking? And what about the fight against ISIS? What would it take for there to be explicit cooperation between the U.S. and Iran? [SEP] Well, let's be clear, solving the mess in Syria requires everyone at the table: Russians, Iranians, Turks, and our Gulf partners. It's a chaotic situation with too many factions, too much money, and too many weapons flooding in. It's a mix of sectarian conflict and geopolitical maneuvering. To fix it, the major powers interested in Syria need to agree that it can't be won on the battlefield. Iran's a key player, and they need to be part of the conversation. Now, let me reiterate, we haven't restored normal diplomatic relations with Iran, and I don't see that happening anytime soon. So, I don't foresee formal agreements with Iran on our counter-ISIS campaign. However, Iran has influence in Iraq, which has a majority Shia population. They have relationships, some natural, with Iran. We expect Prime Minister Abadi to work with Iran as a neighbor. But some relationships are less legitimate, like Iran funding Shia militias that have killed American soldiers and might commit atrocities in Sunni areas. Our diplomats and military teams are assessing where we can deconflict and work with Abadi on an overall strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty. We're also telling Abadi when Iran's actions are a problem and we can't cooperate unless those folks are removed. These conversations are ongoing. You can count on any U.S. government or military work in Iraq with other partners being based on the idea that they report to the Iraqi government and security forces. If we don't trust that Abadi is directing those soldiers, it's tough to have any direct relationship. Got it?", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. A two-part question: The New Yorker reports that the Red Cross has found the interrogation program in the CIA detention facilities used interrogation techniques that were tantamount to torture. I'm wondering if you have read that report and what your reaction to it is. And the second part of the question is, more than a year ago, you said that you wanted to close the detention facility at Guantanamo, and a year later, nothing has actually happened in that regard. Your Vice President, Attorney General, and Homeland Security Secretary are reported to be resisting such a move. I wonder if you could tell us who's really in charge on this issue. Are you doing anything about it? Do you expect Guantanamo to be open or closed when you leave office? [SEP] I did say it should be a goal of the Nation to shut down Guantanamo. I also made it clear that part of the delay was the reluctance of some nations to take back some of the people being held there. In other words, in order to make it work, we've got to have a place for these people to go. I don't know if you noticed a resolution of the Senate the other day, where all but three Senators said we don't want these prisoners in the country. I don't know if it was a 97-3 vote, but it was something-to-3 vote. In other words, part of the issue, Peter, is the practical issue of what do we do with the people?And you say nothing has taken place. I strongly disagree with that. First of all, we are working with other nations to send folks back. Again, it's a fairly steep order. A lot of people don't want killers in their midst, and a lot of these people are killers. Secondly, of course, we want to make sure that when we do send them back, they're treated as humanely as possible.The other issue was whether or not we can get people to be tried. One of the things I'm anxious about, want to see happen, is that there to be trials. Courts have been involved with deciding how to do this, and Defense is trying to work out mechanisms to get the trials up and running. And the sooner we can get that up and running, the better it is, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to make any predictions about whether Guantanamo will be available or not. I'm just telling you it's a very complicated subject.And I laid out an aspiration. Whether or not we can achieve that or not, we'll try to. But it is not as easy a subject as some may think on the surface. Again, I refer to you to the Senate vote. When asked whether or not you want to shut down Guantanamo and, therefore, receive some of those prisoners in your home State, there didn't seem to be a lot of support for it.

My decision was based on the specific circumstances of her case, including the length of her sentence relative to others and her acceptance of responsibility. It was not a blanket endorsement of leaking classified information. We must protect national security, but we also need to ensure that justice is served fairly. Regarding WikiLeaks, the intelligence community's findings on Russian hacking were not conclusive about their role in the DNC email leak. I don't base my decisions on Julian Assange's pronouncements.

But as I said last night, this will not change until the politics changes and the behavior of elected officials changesAnd so the main thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to talk about this on a regular basis, and I will politicize it because our inaction is a political decision that we are makingThe reason that Congress does not support even the modest gun safety laws that we proposed after Sandy Hook is not because the majority of the American people don't support it I mean, normally, politicians are responsive to the views of the electorate Here you've got the majority of the American people think it's the right thing to do Background checks, other commonsense steps that would maybe save some lives couldn't even get a full vote And why is that? It's because of politics It's because interest groups fund campaigns, feed people fear And in fairness, it's not just in the Republican Party, although the Republican Party is just uniformly opposed to all gun safety laws And unless we change that political dynamic, we're not going to be able to make a big dent in this problemFor example, you'll hear people talk about, The problem is not guns, it's mental illness Well, if you talk to people who study this problem, it is true that the majority of these mass shooters are angry young men, but there are hundreds of millions of angry young men around the world—tens of millions of angry young men Most of them don't shoot It doesn't help us just to identify—and the majority of people who have mental illnesses are not shooters So we can't sort through and identify ahead of time who might take actions like this The only thing we can do is make sure that they can't have an entire arsenal when something snaps in themAnd if we're going to do something about that, the politics has to change The politics has to change And the people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom or communistic or a plot by me to take over and stay in power forever or something [] I mean, there are all kinds of crackpot conspiracy theories that float around there, some of which, by the way, are ratified by elected officials in the other party on occasionSo we've got to change the politics of this And that requires people to feel—not just feel deeply—because I get a lot of letters after this happens: Do something!

Protectionism is a significant concern. In challenging economic times, the inclination is to erect barriers and prioritize domestic interests, even at the expense of competition. This sentiment was present even during periods of economic prosperity. After all, CAFTA barely passed. It would be a grave error for us to embrace protectionism. Perhaps the Bush Center at SMU could serve as a reminder of the advantages of free and fair trade, which benefit our workers, workers abroad, and promote development, particularly in developing nations.

{"sentence": "So, how are we planning to address this disparity? Will the United States commit to further international aid in the form of vaccine doses? And realistically, given the current situation, is ending the pandemic by 2022 a feasible goal? [SEP] It's conceivable that it'll take a little longer on a global scale. The United States remains dedicated. There's a chance, perhaps between 2022 and 2023, that we could provide another billion doses. However, that's not yet finalized. I've been careful to share what I know and what I believe is achievable. I don't want to make promises I can't keep. The G-7 members were in agreement: we're committed until we can meet the needs of the entire world. It's not only the ethical thing to do, but also crucial for our own health and security. Walls can't stop new variants. This will be a continuous undertaking, and future pandemics are possible. We need a system to identify potential threats early on. Therefore, as long as nations require vaccinations, we will continue to assist. Furthermore, we're supporting countries in developing their own vaccine production capabilities. India has the potential to do so, but currently lacks the necessary resources. We're working to provide not only vaccines, but also the means for countries to produce their own. Last question.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning Ukraine, should the cease-fire prove durable, will the United States and its European allies consider a rollback of the sanctions regime? Or do you deem it imperative to maintain these sanctions irrespective of the cease-fire's success? Furthermore, could you elaborate on the specific contributions the U.S. will make to the Rapid Response Force, in terms of troop deployments and equipment provisions, beyond the commitments articulated in Warsaw? [SEP] While we remain optimistic regarding the cease-fire agreement, past experiences with separatist factions and the Russian Federation necessitate a degree of skepticism. The agreement's efficacy must be rigorously assessed. Our European counterparts are currently deliberating the final configuration of their sanctions measures. In my estimation, the implementation of President Poroshenko's plan will require a sustained period. Consequently, maintaining the existing sanctions framework, while signaling a willingness to rescind them upon demonstrable adherence to the plan's tenets, represents the most prudent course of action to ensure compliance. It is crucial to acknowledge that the current cease-fire is attributable, in no small part, to the sanctions already imposed and the threat of further sanctions, which are exerting a tangible impact on the Russian economy and fostering its isolation on the global stage. The opportunity remains for Russia to reintegrate into the community of nations that uphold international law, and we urge President Putin to seize it. The unity and resolve exhibited by the transatlantic alliance in supporting Ukraine and implementing sanctions underscore the gravity with which we view the fundamental principle that larger nations cannot simply subjugate smaller ones or compel them to relinquish their sovereignty. I am highly gratified by the collaborative efforts undertaken throughout this crisis in Ukraine, and I believe that U.S. leadership has been indispensable throughout this process. Regarding the Rapid Response Forces, I announced a $1 billion initiative in Warsaw. A substantial portion of these funds will be allocated to implementing various facets of the readiness action plan. We have already augmented personnel rotations in the Baltic States, for instance, and we maintain air policing operations and other activities in the Baltic and Black Seas. This initiative serves to complement, coordinate, and integrate these efforts further, with additional contributions from our partners. It signifies NATO's unwavering commitment to Article 5, particularly in light of recent Russian actions and rhetoric.

How do you see that debate?And, Prime Minister Jansa, I would like to ask you on climate change, how do you rate the chances that in the following years there will be an agreement with the U.S. on this issue? [SEP] First of all, if you were living in Israel, you'd be a little nervous too if a leader in your neighborhood announced that they—he'd like to destroy you. And one sure way of achieving that means is through the development of a nuclear weapon. Therefore, now is the time for all of us to work together to stop them. There's a lot of urgencies when it comes to dealing with , and the Israeli political folks—and if you go to Israel and listen carefully, you'll hear that urgency in their voice—one of many urgencies. And I'm hopeful we can get it done.And by the way—I don't want to preclude the Prime Minister's answer—I think we can actually get an agreement on global climate change during my Presidency, just so you know. I believe in a global agreement for a joint fight against climate change. This is, as a matter of fact, the only solution. An agreement or a self-commitment of the most developed or industrial countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not enough, especially because some developing countries are developing really fast. China will, in a few years, become the first in terms of the greenhouse gas emissions. And a global agreement without the developing countries would be a short-term solution.So, as a matter of fact, we really need that everybody who is a key stakeholder sits at the table. And I have mentioned already in my introduction, those who are most developed should take the leading role. And therefore, this alliance, these agreements, these discussions on bringing closer the standpoints is of such significance.As President Bush has mentioned, the commitment of the most developed economies—which is mandatory to reduce emissions by a certain deadline—this is a key commitment: how individual economies this reach is less important. However, the goals must be set, and we must have mandatory goals, and this is of key importance. And in this way, we will reduce the threat of climate change.And of course, we should also attract to this task the other countries. Without the leading role of the European Union and the United States of America and without close cooperation, it is not possible to reach a global agreement in short term. Therefore, this discussion is of extreme importance. And the G-8 summit in Japan in next month should represent an important step forward if we wish, in time, before the U.N. conference in Copenhagen, reach this agreement. There is not much time left. The time is running out. All right, we'll take the last one from John McKinnon of the Wall Street Journal. It's called technology. []", "label": "Implicit"}

We're even helping folks buy homes through the Small Business Administration, because that's how most middle-class families build wealth. I can't promise to get rid of inflation completely, but we're working on it. Gas prices are already down a good bit. But these oil companies are making a killing. They made over $100 billion in profits last quarter! They should be investing in more refineries or passing those savings on to the gas stations, but they're not. We're also tackling the everyday costs that families face, like prescription drugs. We're bringing those prices down, starting next year. Insulin, for example, will cost no more than $35 a month. We're going after all those things that eat into people's budgets – housing, food, gas, healthcare. We've already passed laws to lower those costs, and they're starting to kick in.

The fact is, we're a nation of laws, and we respect privacy. But because of Snowden, countries that actually abuse their citizens are now pointing fingers at us.

Two months ago in Trinidad, at the Summit of the Americas, you said that--you called on Latin American countries to help you with deeds, not words, particularly towards less democratic countries. Have you noticed any particular progress in these 2 months, and can you give us examples if so? [SEP] Well, first of all, I'm very much looking forward to seeing President Bachelet. I think she's one of the finest leaders in Latin America, a very capable person. If you look at how Chile has handled the recession, they've handled it very well, in part because the surpluses that they got when copper prices were very high they set aside. And so they had a--the resources to deal with the downturn. It's a good lesson for the United States. When we had surpluses, they got dissipated.We think that there's enormous possibilities of making progress in Latin America generally. One of the things that I'll be talking about with President Bachelet is the coordination and cooperation between the United State and Chile on clean energy. We'll have an announcement when we do our press conference after my bilateral meeting on some important clean energy partnerships. We're making important progress when it comes to exchanges on cancer research. We continue to have a robust trade regime with Chile. So--and by the way, Chile has actually entered into some very interesting partnerships, not just with the Federal Government but also with State governments like California.So I think the relationship that we have with Chile--which, by the way, does not fall in line with U.S. foreign policy on every single issue--but it's a respectful policy. Chile is an important partner. I think that's the model that we want: partnership. The United States doesn't dictate how Chile should view its own interests, but in fact, we've achieved great cooperation. And I will be looking at President Bachelet giving us further advice in terms of how we can take the kind of relationship we have with Chile and expand that to our relationships throughout Latin America.

Luckily, we record these interviews now – a handy tool against, shall we say, 'fake news.' The Prime Minister will ultimately decide her course. My only request is that it doesn't impede trade. We want to trade with the U.K., and vice versa. We're their biggest partner, and we can easily expand that.

[SEP] I generally try to avoid getting involved in other countries' internal affairs. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. She's perhaps the only leader among our closest allies who was there when I first arrived, making us veterans of many challenges over the past 8 years. While we haven't always agreed on every issue, her core values, integrity, truthfulness, thoughtfulness, diligence, knowledge, and commitment to the interests of the German people, while recognizing the importance of global engagement and multilateral institutions, have been outstanding. It's her decision whether to run again, and ultimately, the German people will decide. If I were German, I might support her. As for Russia, my approach has been consistent since I took office. Russia is an important country, a military superpower with global influence. Cooperation with Russia is in our interest to solve many global problems. We should hope for a successful Russia with a growing economy and good relations with its neighbors. I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but I'm realistic about our differences. We can't set aside our values of democracy, free speech, international norms, and the rule of law. We've had significant differences on issues like Ukraine and Syria. I hope the President-elect will take a similar approach, finding areas for cooperation while standing up to Russia when it deviates from our values. I'm encouraged by the President-elect's commitment to NATO. Regarding my conversations with President Putin, they occurred before the election. There's clear proof of their cyber attacks, which isn't new. We've delivered a clear message that meddling with elections or targeting private organizations is unacceptable, and we'll respond appropriately. We need international frameworks to prevent a cyber arms race. We've started working on principles at the G-20, G-7, and U.N. levels, but more work is needed. The transition period in the United States is proceeding smoothly, with the outgoing administration sharing its knowledge with the incoming one. This encourages us to continue the good cooperation between the United States and Germany. I'll approach this with an open mind and a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. On Russia, it's about respecting certain principles. From a European perspective, peace depends on respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty. The reverse would be a dangerous path. We're pinning our hopes on political efforts like the Normandy process. Russia is our neighbor, and we have an interest in a good relationship.

We had a discussion about what steps could be taken to continue to spur economic growth. And that may not always involve government spending. For example, the rebalancing agenda that I talked about is one way in which we can make a big difference in spurring on global demand. It requires some adjustments, some changes in behavior on the part of countries. But it doesn't necessarily involve classic fiscal stimulus.There wasn't a dispute with the Europeans.

And I think if you talk to European leaders, they are the first ones to say that that begins with European leaders arriving at a common course of action.So essentially, what we've seen is all the elements for dealing with the crisis put in place, and we think those are the right elements. The first is having a solution to the specific problem of Greece. And although the actions of Papandreou and the referendum issue over the last couple of days I think got a lot of people nervous, the truth is, is that the general approach, which involved a voluntary reduction on the part of those who hold the Greeks' debt, reducing the obligations of the Greek Government, Greece continuing with reforms and structural change, that's the right recipe. It just has to be carried out. And I was encouraged by the fact that despite all the turmoil in Greece, even the opposition leader in Greece indicated that it's important to move forward on the proposal.The second component is recapitalization of Europe's banks. And they have identified that need and they are resourcing that need. And that I think is going to be critical to further instill confidence in the markets.And the third part of it is creating this firewall, essentially sending a signal to the markets that Europe is going to stand behind the euro. And all the details, the structure, how it operates, are still being worked out among the European leaders. What we were able to do was to give them some ideas, some options in terms of how they would put that together.And what we've said is--and I'm speaking now for the whole of the G-20--what we've said is the international community is going to stand ready to assist and make sure that the overall global economy is cushioned by the gyrations in the market and the shocks that arise as Europe is working these issues through. And so they're going to have a strong partner in us. But European leaders understand that ultimately what the markets are looking for is a strong signal from Europe that they're standing behind the euro.", "label": "Implicit"}

[SEP] Look, those Soviet-era flags you saw yesterday? Don't read too much into it. It's an interesting debate. Every nation assures me Russia won't have a veto over Bucharest's decisions, and I trust them. That's the right approach. I'm committed to Ukraine and Georgia joining MAP. It's in our, NATO's, and their best interests. On missile defense, I've clearly told President Putin it's not aimed at Russia. They could easily overwhelm it. It's for threats from the Middle East, like our Far East systems protect us from single or dual launches. We need to ease suspicions, but we're making progress. Ukraine's NATO membership is about national interest, not targeting anyone. Our history shows collective defense is vital for sovereignty and integrity. Joining MAP is the best response for Ukraine's future. Debates in Europe shouldn't create obstacles. We're on the right track, acting within our sovereignty. The open-door policy shouldn't be replaced by a veto from a non-member. The discussion is overheated, lacking respect. Wisdom should prevail. I want calmness, stability, and security for Ukraine. We want to discuss Ukraine's presence in the world and internally. Those are my motives. Some political forces disagree, which is natural.

Mr. Snowden faces serious charges, and it's up to the Attorney General and the judiciary to handle the matter. I can't offer specific commentary. However, I do believe the conversation he initiated was vital. That being said, the manner of these disclosures caused significant harm to our intelligence operations. There could have been a less damaging way to proceed. The United States, despite its imperfections, upholds the rule of law and deeply values privacy.

However, they're often hesitant to publicly support a solution due to their business interests before Congress.

If he makes a genuine commitment to discuss his nuclear weapons program, then I'd be willing to meet. That commitment has to include serious discussions about denuclearization and reducing tensions.

{"sentence": "Given the fluid circumstances in Libya, what specific metrics will dictate the transfer of command, and why is NATO the preferred entity to oversee this transition?

This is essential for the effective operation of the no-fly zone and the safety of our coalition pilots. Humanitarian aspects are also a crucial consideration. I anticipate this transition occurring in a matter of days, not weeks. The Pentagon will provide further details. NATO's coordinating function is invaluable due to its unique capabilities. Regarding this partnership, it's a two-way street. Chile has much to offer, particularly in clean energy. We're exploring collaborations in education and security, addressing issues like narcotrafficking. This isn't about a developed nation aiding a less developed one; it's a collaboration among equals. Regarding Latin American integration, we lag behind Europe. While the idea of a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego was once floated, it never materialized. Latin America needs to fulfill its potential, drawing on shared values and principles with the U.S. We seek a partnership that encompasses democracy, free trade, education, and innovation.

They considered locations outside of Washington, but I believe it's crucial to keep it near the Justice Department. Building a new facility is the best option, ensuring its longevity.

I don't want to comment on the specifics of the investigation. The FBI has its own protocols in terms of how they proceed, and I'm going to let Director Mueller and others examine those protocols and make some statements to the public generally.I do want to emphasize what I've said before: General Petraeus had an extraordinary career. He served this country with great distinction in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and as head of the CIA. By his own assessment, he did not meet the standards that he felt were necessary as the Director of CIA with respect to this personal matter that he is now dealing with with his family and with his wife. And it's on that basis that he tendered his resignation, and it's on that basis that I accepted it.But I want to emphasize that, from my perspective at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service.

Do they offer hope, or do they raise concerns? Furthermore, do you concur with Prime Minister David Cameron's assertion that a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan is feasible by 2015? [SEP] I am uncertain about the accuracy of that quote from David Cameron, but let me address the latter question first. Our presence in Afghanistan has now extended for nine years, and next year will mark a decade. This represents America's longest war. Consequently, we all share an interest not in occupying Afghanistan, but in ensuring its stability, its ability to independently manage its security, and its prevention from becoming a base for terrorist activities directed against the United States. We will need to provide ongoing assistance to Afghanistan, aiding in the development of a national government, courts, effective police forces, and a transparent and fair political system. However, this differs from maintaining troops on the ground. Our policy, announced last November, involves deploying additional troops to provide the Afghan government with the necessary space and time to strengthen its security forces, counter the Taliban's momentum, and improve governance. General Petraeus is continuing this policy, with the endorsement of our allies and President Karzai. It is a formidable challenge, given Afghanistan's poverty, illiteracy, and history of conflict. We anticipate progress by the end of this year, followed by a comprehensive review and adjustments as needed. Ultimately, as in Iraq, a political solution is essential. Regarding the negotiations, it is premature to draw conclusions. We must approach them with skepticism but also openness.

If they reach an agreement, we'll support it internationally, including Turkey and Greece. Vice President Biden has been deeply involved, and we see a window for resolution. As for Europe, my situation was simpler with congressional majorities. Europe faces multiple parliaments, commissions, and unions, making consensus difficult.

All this talk about process misses the point. Qadhafi, a major threat, was about to massacre his people. We joined a U.N.-backed coalition to neutralize his air defenses, protecting civilians. I promised no ground troops and that our allies would lead. We've kept our word. No U.S. troops, and our allies have carried their weight. We've protected thousands in Benghazi, with no U.S. casualties and no escalation. It's a limited mission. We've consulted with Congress throughout. This controversy is mostly political theater.

The fundamental question is whether we will engage in endless discussions on a matter that we have already resolved. We firmly believe that Kosovo should be independent. The G-8 discussions were focused on finding a way to make this outcome acceptable to Russia. Ideally, Russia would acknowledge and accept our conclusion. However, they have not yet reached that point. Therefore, I stressed the need for progress to prevent unmet expectations in Kosovo. That was my intention. We will actively pursue the process. President Putin presented an interesting proposal regarding missile defense for Europe. I also proposed a missile defense system for Europe, designed to protect Europe, not to threaten Russia. The primary threats we face originate from rogue nations that may possess deliverable weapons. It is in the interest of peace to have the capacity to intercept such missiles. President Putin suggested the joint use of radar in Azerbaijan. I agreed to consider it. However, it became clear that he also had reservations about my proposal. Therefore, I proposed that we assemble a group to transparently discuss our respective ideas, sharing technologies and radar positioning to ensure effective coverage. His statement was significant, as it acknowledged the potential for cooperation. Russia is not our enemy. The Cold War has ended. We are now confronting 21st-century threats.

And on the pandemic, given the Supreme Court's block of the vaccine-or-test rule for large businesses, are you reconsidering vaccine mandates for domestic flights to improve vaccination rates? [SEP] Right, let's start with the last part: The Supreme Court's decision, I believe, was a misstep.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, about the U.S.-Japan alliance and your Indo-Pacific strategy, you're heading to China, which isn't exactly known for being free or open.

He wants to sell you weapons, and there's been talk he was disappointed you didn't take out that North Korean missile. Did that come up, and what's your take on Japan's defense? [SEP] Let me just jump in here on the Prime Minister's point. He'll be knocking those missiles out of the sky as soon as he wraps up buying all that extra military stuff from us. Just like we did in Saudi Arabia, quick and clean. So, Japan's gonna be buying a lot of our top-notch gear, like the F-35, the stealthiest thing out there, and all sorts of missiles. That means jobs for us, and safety for Japan. Now, China, I get along great with President Xi. We're friends. But he's China, I'm the U.S. We see things differently, especially on trade. The problem is, they've been taking advantage of us for years. Our trade deficit is massive, hundreds of billions a year, not even counting intellectual property. We're talking to China about it, and it's gotta change. It's gotta be fair, or reciprocal. I like reciprocal. People understand it. If you charge me this, I charge you the same. Makes sense. We're gonna start doing that. Some countries charge us a hundred percent, and we charge them nothing. That's ending. It takes time, legal stuff, but it's coming. You're gonna see the U.S. take strong action against countries that have been unfair to us. It's already started, and the legal groundwork is done. Big changes are on the way. On Japan's defense, we buy a lot from the U.S. The North Korean situation is serious, so we need to boost our defense. F-35A, SM-3 Block IIA, Aegis vessels, all from the U.S. We'll shoot down missiles if necessary, working closely with the U.S.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

The Russian economy has stalled. Capital flight is huge. Investors are staying away. Putin has a choice: diplomacy or hurting his economy and people. We're doing what we should. Our allies agree. But the issue isn't resolved. Fighting continues. Civilians are dying. The Malaysian Airlines disaster is a consequence.

Then again, it is possible it still would not have been. We could have had a completely new environmental review process, and they still might have said, this meets industry standards. That is what this commission needs to determine. Was this a systemic failure? Or a one-in-a-million occurrence? What are the inherent risks? The fact that oil companies now have to drill a mile underwater and then another 3 miles below that tells us something about the oil industry.

She lost the Congress once. I think she's going to lose it again. She lifted my poll numbers up 10 points. I never thought that I would see that so quickly and so easily.I'm leading everybody. We're doing great. I don't want to do it that way. It's almost unfair if you think about it. But I think she's incompetent, and I think she's not thinking about the country.

And maybe it's going to be a very little problem. I hope that it's going to be a very little problem. But we have to work together.Instead, she wants to do that—same thing with Cryin' Chuck Schumer. He goes out, and he says: The President only asked for $2½ billion. He should have 8½. This is the first time I've ever been told that we should take more. Usually, it's we have to take less.And we should be working together. He shouldn't be making statements like that, because it's so bad for the country. And Nancy Pelosi—I mean, she should go back to her district and clean it up, because it's the number one—if you look at percentage down, that was one of the finest in the world, and now you look at what's happening.And I'm just saying, we should all be working together.

That's okay. We'll take more money. But they shouldn't demean the people that are on the stage, who are the finest in the world. They're not demeaning me.

And what about Julian Assange's offer to come to the US – are you seeking his extradition and would he be prosecuted? [SEP] Let's be clear, Chelsea Manning served a significant prison sentence. It's not as if leaking classified information goes unpunished. The sentence she received was very disproportionate to what other leakers have received. She went to trial, due process was carried out, and she took responsibility for her crime. I felt it made sense to commute her sentence, not pardon it. Justice has been served, and a message has been sent that national security is paramount. People with concerns about government actions should use established channels and whistleblower protections. I recognize some think these aren't enough, but we need to balance accountability with the safety of those in the field. With respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. I haven't commented on WikiLeaks generally. The intelligence community's conclusions on Russian hacking and WikiLeaks were not conclusive. I don't pay attention to Assange's tweets. I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations. In this cyber age, we need to balance accountability, openness, and transparency with national security.

Are you concerned that failure to pass voting rights legislation will cost your party seats in the 2022 elections? [SEP] My concern lies with the fundamentally un-American character of these initiatives. It is, frankly, sickening. The notion that states would prohibit providing water to individuals waiting in line to vote, or that voting would cease at 5 PM, coinciding with the end of the workday for many, or that absentee ballots would be severely restricted. This is all by design. My efforts will be concentrated on three key areas: first, securing passage of the legislation approved by the House; second, educating the American public; and third, mobilizing Republican voters who find these actions reprehensible. These are not the elected officials, but the voters outside this White House. I am confident that we can defeat this because it is a most egregious assault on our democracy.

The initial discourse fostered the perception that Republicans harbor animosity towards immigrants. If that is the prevailing image, others may feel similarly alienated. Our party must be characterized by compassion and broadmindedness. I recall the 1964 elections, during which my father's Senate campaign was overwhelmed by the Johnson landslide. The Republican Party suffered a significant setback at that time, but experienced a resurgence in '66. A similar recovery is possible now, provided we ensure that our message is inclusive and compassionate, demonstrating our concern for people's lives and our commitment to improving them.", "label": "General"}

Reports also suggest that Al Qaeda has regained pre-9/11 strength along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Is President Karzai's assessment accurate? And do you believe the new Pakistani government is both willing and capable of combating terrorism? [SEP] Let's start by stating that we're taking his allegations seriously and will collaborate with his team to investigate thoroughly. Undeniably, there's a flow of extremists originating from parts of Pakistan into Afghanistan. This is a concern for us, for Afghanistan, and should be equally concerning for Pakistan. We share a common adversary: extremists who resort to violence to disrupt or undermine democratic processes. Al Qaeda remains a presence. We've dealt them significant blows globally, including within Pakistan, and we'll maintain pressure alongside our Pakistani counterparts. I trust that the Pakistani government recognizes the inherent dangers of extremists operating within their borders. Indeed, I believe they do. We'll have the opportunity to delve deeper into this matter during discussions with the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Monday. Pakistan is an ally, a friend. And I reiterate: the United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are united by a shared enemy. I recall vividly a meeting at the White House with Presidents Musharraf and Karzai, where we emphasized the imperative of cross-border cooperation to prevent the infiltration of dangerous elements for training purposes into Afghanistan, and their subsequent return with skills that could be leveraged against the government. While some progress was achieved, the struggle persists. We were encouraged by the Provincial elections in that region.

[SEP] I'm not going to speculate on future elections or potential successors. That's for the political commentators to discuss. Regarding Cuba, our priority is to empower the Cuban people through engagement, not regime change. We want to create an environment where they can decide their own future. The Cold War is over, and we need to move beyond the old ways of thinking.

Our approach is to lead by example and advocate for our values through persuasion. Cuba isn't a direct threat to our national security, but we will continue to address our differences constructively.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Republicans say, more than anything else, what this election was about was spending. And they say it will be when hell freezes over that they will accept anything remotely like a stimulus bill or any kind of the proposals you have out there to stimulate job growth through spending. Do you accept the fact that any kind of spending to create jobs is dead at this point? And if so, what else can Government do to create jobs, which is the number-one issue? [SEP] Well, I think this is going to be an important question for Democrats and Republicans. I think the American people are absolutely concerned about spending and debt and deficits. And I'm going to have a deficit commission that is putting forward its ideas. It's a bipartisan group that includes Republican and Democratic Members of Congress. Hopefully, they were able to arrive at some consensus on some areas where we can eliminate programs that don't work, cut back on Government spending that is inefficient, can streamline Government, but isn't cutting into the core investments that are going to make sure that we are a competitive economy that is growing and providing opportunity for years to come.So the question I think that my Republican friends and me and Democratic leaders are going to have answer is, what are our priorities? What do we care about? And that's going to be a tough debate, because there are some tough choices here.We already had a big deficit that I inherited, and that has been made worse because of the recession. As we bring it down, I want to make sure that we're not cutting into education that is going to help define whether or not we can compete around the world. I don't think we should be cutting back on research and development, because if we can develop new technologies, in areas like clean energy, that could make all the difference in terms of job creation here at home.I think the proposal that I put forward with respect to infrastructure is one that, historically, we've had bipartisan agreement about. And we should be able to agree now that it makes no sense for China to have better rail systems than us and Singapore having better airports than us. And we just learned that China now has the fastest supercomputer on Earth; that used to be us. They're making investments because they know those investments will pay off over the long term.And so in these budget discussions, the key is to be able to distinguish between stuff that isn't adding to our growth, isn't an investment in our future, and those things that are absolutely necessary for us to be able to increase job growth in the future as well.Now, the single most important thing I think we need to do economically--and this is something that has to be done during the lame duck session--is making sure that taxes don't go up on middle class families next year. And so we've got some work to do on that front to make sure that families not only aren't seeing a higher tax burden, which will automatically happen if Congress doesn't act, but also making sure that business provisions that, historically, we have extended each year--that, for example, provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States in research and development--that those are extended. I think it makes sense for us to extend unemployment insurance because there are still a lot of folks out there hurting.So there are some things that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it, even as we're also sitting down and figuring out, okay, over the next several years what kinds of budget cuts can we make that are intelligent, that are smart, that won't be undermining our recovery, but, in fact, will be encouraging job growth.", "label": "Dodging"}

In other words, let's say Canada—where we have tremendous tariffs—the United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy. As an example, 270 percent. Nobody knows that. We pay nothing. We don't want to pay anything. Why should we pay?We have to—ultimately, that's what you want. You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair. So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That's the way you learned at the Wharton School of Finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing.

Just can't have it. And when they send things into us, you don't have that. I will say, it was not contentious. What was strong was the language that this cannot go on. But the relationships are very good, whether it be President Macron or with Justin. We had—Justin did a really good job. I think the relationships were outstanding.But because of the fact that the United States leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade—and again, I'm not blaming countries, I'm blaming our people that represented our past. It's got to change. It's going to change. I mean, it's not a question of I hope it changes. It's going to change, a hundred percent. And tariffs are going to come way down, because we—people cannot continue to do that. We're like the piggybank that everybody is robbing. And that ends.In fact, Larry Kudlow is a great expert on this, and he's a total free trader. But even Larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs. Would you like to say something on that, Larry, very quickly? It might be interesting. One interesting point, in terms of the G-7 group meeting—I don't know if they were surprised with President Trump's free-trade proclamation, but they certainly listened to it and we had lengthy discussions about that. As the President said, all—reduce these barriers. In fact, go to zero: zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, zero subsidies.And along the way, we're going to have to clean up the international trading system about which there was virtual consensus of agreement on that. And that will be a target. And these are the best ways to promote economic growth, and we'll all be better at it, and we'll all be stronger at it. So, I myself was particularly gratified to hear my President talk about free trade. Thank you, sir. . Thank you.And it's very unfair to our farmers. Our farmers are, essentially—whether it's through a barrier, nonmonetary barrier, or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible—and this is all over the world. This isn't just G-7. I mean, we have India, where some of the tariffs are a hundred percent. A hundred percent. And we charge nothing. We can't do that. And so we are talking to many countries.

Is the U.S. doing enough on global vaccinations, or should American children wait until adults in other countries are vaccinated? [SEP] That's it? I thought I said two questions, but I guess that means two or more from each person called on. Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in—on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that. With regard to am I confident?—I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms—[]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far. I don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten—we've each committed—I trust the members of—the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment. With regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience—but reconciliation—that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today. Today—I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get—if you're making less than $150,000—you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get—in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth—12 months divided—$3,600—$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty—child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer. We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who—what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done. Thank you. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO. And we are convinced of ours—needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial. And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States. And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values. And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic—we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible—which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines. And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We're going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance, I agree.

Let's be clear: We've done more testing than any other country, by far. More than India with its 1.5 billion people, more than China, more than anyone. Our testing is the best in the world. Other countries are calling us, asking how we do it. But here's the thing: when you test as much as we do – 65 million people and counting – you're going to find more cases. If you went to Mexico or other countries, you'd see they barely test at all. They only test people who are already sick. We've done the most testing, and we've done the best job overall. We even became the 'ventilator king,' supplying the whole world with these complex and vital machines. And when you look at the numbers, we were impacted less than many other countries. Now, some of those countries are seeing explosions of cases, even though they had advantages. So, we've done a great job. She's just wrong on the facts.

But we've put on some very tough sanctions, and other things too. I want to thank President Xi of China, who's done more for us than any other administration has seen. He's really tightened up the border, and he's done it powerfully. He didn't think he'd go this far, and I appreciate that. It's put a lot of pressure on them. 93 percent of the goods going into North Korea come from China. President Xi understands that these next few months are very important.

And yet we haven't seen action; in other words, he hasn't responded. It's one thing to send a message, it's another thing to have the person receiving the message actually do something.

Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions—like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference—but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching? [SEP] [] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was—I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the—a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.I did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.With regard to—I always found—and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know—but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other. It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are—with Russia.We're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward—[]—with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he'll make clear how—from his perspective, how it turned out.But I don't want to get into being diverted by: Did they shake hands?

Under what conditions might you consider a plea agreement or amnesty for Mr. Snowden? And what is your message to Americans who, after recent developments, believe that Mr. Snowden's actions were justified in exposing the extent of government surveillance and should not be considered criminal by this government? [SEP] I must exercise caution here, Major, as Mr. Snowden is currently under indictment and facing criminal charges. This matter falls within the purview of the Attorney General and, ultimately, a judge and a jury. Therefore, I cannot offer specific commentary on this case at this time. However, I will attempt to address the underlying sentiment of the question, even if I cannot delve into the specifics. I have previously stated, and I maintain, that this was an important conversation that needed to occur. I have also stated that the manner in which these disclosures were made has been detrimental to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities. I believe that there was a way to have this conversation without causing such harm. To provide a specific example, the United States, despite its imperfections, is a nation that adheres to the rule of law, deeply values privacy, civil liberties, and our Constitution. As a result of these disclosures, countries that actively engage in the very activities that Mr. Snowden claims to be concerned about—such as surveillance of their own citizens, targeting political dissidents, and suppressing the press—are now able to stand on the sidelines and portray the United States as having problems with surveillance and intelligence operations. This is a distorted view of the situation. While this debate has been important and necessary, it is also crucial to remember that it has caused unnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and U.S. diplomacy.

You've been calling on this for years. And if you couldn't get it through a Democratic Congress, why do you think you'll be able to get it through now? And also, doesn't it blunt your push for deficit-neutral corporate tax reform? [SEP] Well, I continue to believe I'm right. [] So we're going to try again. I think what's different is everybody says now that they're really serious about the deficit. Well, if you're really serious about the deficit--not just spending, but you're serious about the deficit overall--then part of what you have to look at is unjustifiable spending through the Tax Code, through tax breaks that do not make us more competitive, do not create jobs here in the United States of America.And the two examples you cite, I think, most economists would look at and they'd say these aren't contributing to our long-term economic growth. And if they're not, why are we letting some folks pay lower taxes than other folks who are creating jobs here in the United States and are investing? Why are we not investing in the energy sources of the future, just the ones in the past, particularly if the energy sources of the past are highly profitable right now and don't need a tax break?So I think what may have changed is, if we are going to get serious about deficit reduction and debt reduction, then we've got to look at all the sources of deficit and debt. We can't be just trying to pick and choose and getting a hundred percent of our way.The same is true, by the way, for Democrats. I mean, there are some provisions in this budget that are hard for me to take. You've got cities around the country and States around the country that are having a tremendously difficult time trying to balance their own budgets because of fallen revenue. They've got greater demands because folks have lost their jobs; the housing market is still in a tough way in a lot of these places. And yet part of what this budget says is we're going to reduce community development block grants by 10 percent. That's not something I'd like to do. But--and if it had come up a year ago or 2 years ago, I would have said no. Under these new circumstances, I'm saying yes to that. And so my expectation is, is that everybody is going to have to make those same sorts of compromises.Now, with respect to corporate tax reform, the whole concept of corporate tax reform is to simplify, eliminate loopholes, treat everybody fairly. That is entirely consistent with saying, for example, that we shouldn't provide special treatment to the oil industry when they've been making huge profits and can afford to further invest in their companies without special tax breaks that are different from what somebody else gets.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Jonathan Karl, ABC News. Madam President, thank you. Mr. President, thank you. It wasn't that long ago you were talking about a reset with Russia and were optimistic that relations with Vladimir Putin could be dramatically improved. Did you misjudge him, or did he mislead you? And at this point, isn't it clear that sanctions simply are not going to change his behavior? And just a personal relations question: I'm sure you saw, President Putin was asked that if he were drowning, would you save him? And he said he thought you would save him. So I'm just wondering, was he correct on that? And do you think that Putin would save you? [Laughter]And to President Park, in light of the fact that, as President Obama points out, North Korea is already the most isolated country on the planet, the most sanctioned country, what do you think should be done specifically if they go through with another nuclear test? [SEP] First of all, I absolutely would save Mr. Putin if he were drowning. I'd like to think that if anybody is out there drowning, I'm going to save them. I used to be a pretty good swimmer. I grew up in Hawaii. [] A little out of practice.Keep in mind that, when I came into office, the idea of reset was a recognition that there were a range of issues in which U.S. and Russian interests converged. It was in our national security interests to try to foster cooperation with the Russians so that, for example, we could have alternative supply lines to our troops in Afghanistan; so that we could obtain cooperation from Russia in applying sanctions to Iran and forcing them to the table to see if we could resolve that issue peacefully. And in fact, during the first term of my administration, the approach we took resulted in concrete benefits to the national security posture of the United States. We were able to reduce weapons of mass destruction. We were able to make sure that our troops were adequately supplied in Afghanistan at times, as you'll recall, when there were some tensions within Pakistan after we conducted the raid against bin Laden in Abbottabad. We were able to bring Iran to the table, and we now have what so far, at least, have been constructive discussions about resolving the nuclear problem there.So those were all things that were good for us, and I believe they were actually good for the Russians as well. Mr. Putin, in my second term, has had an increasing tendency to view the world through a cold war prism and to see Russia's interests as invariably in conflict with the West's. I disagree with him in my assessment of what's in Russia's interests, but he's the President of that country. There are still areas that we should be cooperating—on counterterrorism, for example. But his decisions recently—first, with respect to supporting the horrendous bloodshed carried out by the Asad regime in Syria, and then, most clearly, with respect to the situation in Ukraine—makes it much more difficult for us to cooperate. And I suspect that that's going to linger for some time to come.We'll continue to look for areas where, if it's in our national security interests, and they think it's in their interests, that we'll try to find areas where we can work together. But the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine is a principle that the United States has to stand up to.Now, with respect to the impact of sanctions, Russia has a deep interest in what happens in Ukraine, and I think they're going about meeting those interests in entirely the wrong way. But what's clear is—you're right—Mr. Putin is going to make decisions based on what he thinks is best for Russia, and he views Ukraine as absolutely central, critical to his foreign policy and the long-term strategic interests of Russia.That doesn't mean that he doesn't take into account other long-term interests of Russia. Tens of billions of dollars of capital fleeing Russia poses a problem for Russia's long-term interests. Russia being isolated so that no business man or woman with any sense are going to want to invest there. That's a problem for Russia's long-term interests. And President Putin is not a stupid man and, I think, recently acknowledged that this has already had an impact. And certainly if the situation gets worse and sanctions are broadened to an entire sector, that will have a more severe impact on the Russian people and the Russian economy.And so there's going to come a point at which he's got to make a fundamental decision. Is he willing to see the Russian economy that was already weakened, that was already faltering, weaken further because he's unwilling to deal with Ukraine in a diplomatic fashion that respects their sovereignty, but still meets any legitimate interest that Russia may have? Or is he going to use military force and the kind of destabilizing activities that we've seen so far? That's a choice that he's going to have to make. But we shouldn't make the choice easy for him. He should recognize that the international community as a whole is not going to encourage the kinds of actions that he's taken so far.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you for this opportunity to pose a question. My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar. So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security cooperation? What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?And in addition to that, you talked about universal values—solidarity and alliance—and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values—for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries—do you think you can take—resort to those measures as well? [SEP] As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.Let's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced—for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had—[inaudible]—water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.The NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words—empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.", "label": "Explicit"}

[SEP] Okay, number one, it's not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that. Those were the two things I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn't understand the question. Because I said to him—I asked him those two questions: the one question which we covered and the mask question.And I was inaccurately covered, because I was on with George last night—George Stephanopoulos. And I enjoyed it. I think people enjoyed it. I got—you know, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well. But they said a lot of good things about the show, but they always cut my sentences off. You know, they cut it off.On masks, the masks have problems too. And I talked about the masks about to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that, in restaurants, they have people with masks, and they're playing around with their mask, and they have it—their fingers are in their mask, and then they're serving with plates. I mean, I think there's a lot of problems with masks.No, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have—added to the fact that our numbers are going way down. You know, you see the numbers. I'm just reading you statistics that are from wherever they get them. But they're very highly qualified statistics.But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask, perhaps, helps. Don't forget: A lot of people didn't like the concept of masks initially. Dr. Fauci didn't like them, and a lot of people didn't. And I'm not knocking anybody, because I understand both sides of the argument.But when I called up Robert today, I said to him, What's with the masks? He said, I think I answered that question incorrectly. I think maybe he misunderstood it. I mean, you know, you have two questions; maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one is, it's going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he's not aware of the distribution process. It's not really his thing as much as it would be, let's say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster.As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks, because people have used the masks. But when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, you know, we write—if you do the good job—they had, I guess, 240,000. But if you do the good—if it worked out well—now, look, one death is too much. One death is too much; should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000—between a hundred and something and 240,000.As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, thank you. Yesterday's energy bill signing with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid highlighted efforts to curb greenhouse gases. Yet, your administration is blocking California's stricter tailpipe emission plan. How high a priority is fighting greenhouse gases? Why prevent states from exceeding federal standards? And could you share any insights from your recent climate change discussion with Vice President Gore? [SEP] Let's circle back to that last part. Remind me. Look, the core issue is crafting an effective strategy. Is it more effective to let each state decide on curbing greenhouse gases, or to have a national approach? Director Johnson decided based on the new legislation, which enables a national strategy, raising CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 and boosting alternative fuels to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The Director believes this law provides a national plan.I told Vice President Gore I'm serious about this. We're developing an effective strategy. Yesterday's bill is part of that. Replacing gasoline on a mandatory basis will significantly reduce greenhouse gases. The bill wasn't as strong as I wanted, but I signed it.A key to reformulated fuel standards is investing in cellulosic ethanol research. We can't only rely on corn. Many farmers are concerned, especially those feeding cattle or hogs, as costs rise. We're investing taxpayer money in using wood chips or switchgrass for ethanol. This is a real national plan.Globally, countries emitting greenhouse gases must be involved. I opposed Kyoto because China wasn't included. Our efforts alone won't solve the problem unless countries like China participate.At the Bali Conference, we agreed to a 2-year process. We're also working to ensure major emitters agree on a common goal. This strategy was presented at the G-8 in Germany and Bali.I take this seriously. But we must be effective and not wreck our economy. Developing technologies to maintain our living standards and address greenhouse gases requires prosperity.We also need nuclear power. It generates electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. I'm surprised our country isn't more supportive of nuclear power. I applaud Congress's efforts to incentivize new plants.If you're serious about greenhouse gases, you should support nuclear power. It's the best solution for economic growth and environmental stewardship.Combining increased CAFE standards with alternative fuels and a good electricity strategy creates a comprehensive approach. We also have 250 years of coal reserves, and I believe we can develop environmentally friendly technologies to use it.We have a strategy: bringing others to the table and developing our own plan to meet national and international goals.

Coupled with the detention of Iranian-American citizens, where is this heading? Is it time for stringent UN sanctions, and are you confident of Russian and Chinese support? [SEP] As we frequently discuss at these briefings, Iran remains a persistent topic due to their defiance of international demands regarding nuclear weapons. The world has spoken against such programs, yet they consistently disregard these calls. I believe we must strengthen sanctions. I've spoken with Condoleezza Rice, and we'll collaborate with European partners on further sanctions. I'll also discuss this with Presidents Putin and Hu Jintao. These leaders must understand that a nuclear-armed Iran is profoundly destabilizing. It's in their interest to collaborate in isolating the regime. I sympathize with the Iranian people, burdened by a government pursuing a condemned program, hindering economic opportunities. Iran has a rich history and hardworking citizens who deserve a more open society. The government's actions lead to further isolation. Therefore, we'll work with partners to maintain pressure.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In his endorsement of you a few weeks ago, Mayor Bloomberg said he was motivated by the belief that you would do more to confront the threat of climate change than your opponent. Tomorrow you're going up to New York City, where you're going to, I assume, see people who are still suffering the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which many people say is further evidence of how a warming globe is changing our weather. What specifically do you plan to do in a second term to tackle the issue of climate change? And do you think the political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of a tax on carbon? [SEP] As you know, Mark, we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing, faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting, faster than was predicted even 5 years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily—there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe.And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it.Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere. But we haven't done as much as we need to.So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can—what more can we do to make in—short-term progress in reducing carbons and then working through an education process that I think is necessary—a discussion, a conversation across the country—about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with.I don't know what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue, I also think there are regional differences. There's no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices. And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that.If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth, and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support.So you can expect that you'll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward.", "label": "General"}

Can you envision any scenario in which we do go off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year?And on Iran, are you preparing a final diplomatic push here to resolve the nuclear program issue? And are we headed toward one-on-one talks? [SEP] Well, obviously, we can all imagine a scenario where we go off the fiscal cliff. If despite the election, if despite the dangers of going over the fiscal cliff and what that means for our economy, that there's too much stubbornness in Congress that we can't even agree on giving middle class families a tax cut, then middle class families are all going to end up having a big tax hike. And that's going to be a pretty rude shock for them and, I suspect, will have a big impact on the holiday shopping season, which, in turn, will have an impact on business planning and hiring, and we can go back into a recession.It would be a bad thing. It is not necessary. So I want to repeat: Step number one that we can take in the next couple of weeks, provide certainty to middle class families—98 percent of families who make less than $250,000 a year, 97 percent of small businesses—that their taxes will not go up a single dime next year. Give them that certainty right now. We can get that done.We can then set up a structure whereby we are dealing with tax reform, closing deductions, closing loopholes, simplifying, dealing with entitlements. And I'm ready to and willing to make big commitments to make sure that we're locking in the kind of deficit reductions that stabilize our deficit, start bringing it down, start bringing down our debt. I'm confident we can do it.It's—and look, I've been living with this for a couple of years now. I know the math pretty well. And it really is arithmetic, it's not calculus. There are some tough things that have to be done, but there is a way of doing this that does not hurt middle class families, that does not hurt our seniors, doesn't hurt families with disabled kids, allows us to continue to invest in those things that make us grow, like basic research and education, helping young people afford going to college. As we've already heard from some Republican commentators, a modest tax increase on the wealthy is not going to break their backs; they'll still be wealthy. And it will not impinge on business investment.So we know how to do this. This is just a matter of whether or not we come together and go ahead and say, Democrats and Republicans, we're both going to hold hands and do what's right for the American people. And I hope that's what happens.With respect to Iran, I very much want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem. I was very clear before the campaign, I was clear during the campaign, and I'm now clear after the campaign: We're not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon. But I think there is still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically. We've imposed the toughest sanctions in history. It is having an impact on Iran's economy.There should be a way in which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while still meeting their international obligations and providing clear assurances to the international community that they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon.And so yes, I will try to make a push in the coming months to see if we can open up a dialogue between Iran and not just us, but the international community, to see if we can get this thing resolved.

We've started discussions with China to lower it, through free, fair, or reciprocal trade. I prefer reciprocal. People understand it better. We'll charge the same as they charge us. Some countries charge us a hundred-percent tax, but we charge them nothing. I've been against that for a long time, and we'll do something about it. It takes time due to statutory limitations. But you'll see strong action against countries treating the U.S. unfairly. It's already started, the legal foundation is done. You'll see a big difference soon. The U.S. has been treated unfairly on trade. Thank you. Regarding Japan's defense equipment, we buy a lot from the U.S. The North Korean situation is tough, Asia-Pacific security is tough, we must enhance our defense capability. F-35A and SM-3 Block IIA are examples. Aegis vessels must be enhanced. We'll buy more from the U.S. We traced the North Korean missiles. Missile defense is a U.S.-Japan cooperation. If necessary, we'll intercept, but we'll coordinate with the U.S.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

Also, what are the tangible goals you hope to achieve with your 'alliance among equals' initiative in the Americas?

And how quickly this transfer takes place will be determined by the recommendations of our commanding officers that the mission has been completed--the first phase of the mission has been completed. NATO will be involved in a coordinating function because of the extraordinary capacity of that alliance. But I will leave it to Admiral Mullen and those who are directly involved in the operation to describe to you how exactly that transfer might be--might take place. With respect to this new partnership, I don't want to give you all my best lines from my speech; otherwise, no one will come.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You're aware that Senators Kerry and McCain have a proposal on the Senate floor to give you the leeway to continue operations in Libya for a further year. You've just said that this, from the beginning, has been an operation limited in time and scope. Initially, you said days, not weeks. Are you prepared, are the American people prepared for this operation, with American support, to continue for a further year? And is there any other definition of success than Qadhafi being removed from power? [SEP] Well, first of all, Jim, just a slight correction. What I told the American people was that the initial phase where Americans were in the lead would take days, perhaps weeks. And that's exactly what happened, right? I mean, after around 2 weeks, a little less than 2 weeks, we had transitioned where NATO had taken full control of the operation. So promise made, promise kept.Second, I think when you have the former Republican nominee for President, John McCain, and the former nominee for President on the Democratic side, John Kerry, coming together to support what we're doing in , that should tell the American people that this is important. And I very much appreciate their efforts in that regard.Third, when it comes to our definitions of success, the U.N. mandate has said that we are there to make sure that you do not see a massacre directed against n civilians by the n regime. The n regime's capacity has been greatly reduced as a consequence of our operation. That's already been successful. What we've seen both in the east and in the west is that opposition forces have been able to mobilize themselves and start getting organized, and people are starting to see the possibility of a more peaceful future on the horizon.What is also true is, as long as Qadhafi is still presenting himself as the head of the n Government and as long as he still controls large numbers of troops, the n people are going to be in danger of counteroffensives and of retribution. So there is no doubt that Qadhafi stepping down from power is--from the international community's perspective--going to be the primary way that we can assure that the overall mission of 's people being protected is accomplished.And I just want to point out--I know it's something you know--the International Criminal Court identified Qadhafi as having violated international law, having committed war crimes. What we've seen is reports of troops engaging in horrible acts, including potentially using rape as a weapon of war. And so when you have somebody like that in charge of large numbers of troops, I think it'd be hard for us to feel confident that the n people are going to be protected unless he steps down.Now, what that means, whether there's the possibility of ns arriving at some sort of political settlement, that, I think, is something that ultimately the n people are going to have to make a decision about, because the international community is there in service of that broader goal, of a peaceful .", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, there's growing anxiety about the health of our banks. Doesn't the rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac send the wrong message, suggesting that some institutions are immune to failure and encouraging irresponsible behavior? [SEP] Let's clarify the situation with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It's essential to understand their significance to the mortgage markets. Maintaining confidence and stability in these markets is paramount. Secretary Paulson's plan, which requires congressional approval for a line of credit and potential capital investment, is designed to achieve this. The objective is to reassure the public about the importance of these institutions and to ease anxieties. By presenting this plan, we reduce the likelihood of needing to implement this temporary authority. Now, concerning commercial banks, it's crucial to remember that deposits are insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. If there are concerns about a bank's stability, depositors should be aware that the FDIC guarantees their deposits up to $100,000. As a depositor, you are protected by the Federal Government. I remember a bank run in Midland, Texas, where someone attempted to reassure people about their insured deposits, but fear overwhelmed reason. I hope people will step back and recognize that their deposits are secure under our Government's protection.

We're going to help this Government. And I'm able to say that it is—that we have a government that wants our help and is becoming more capable about taking the lead in the fight to protect their own country. The only way that Iraq is going to be able to succeed is when the Iraqis, led by a capable person, says, We're tired of it.

Regarding media access to loved ones being brought home, we're reviewing those policies with the Department of Defense. I don't want to answer before evaluating the review. Afghanistan is a big challenge. Our troops' work and Ambassador Crocker's diplomacy led to a relatively peaceful election in Iraq. The political system seems to be functioning. We don't see that in Afghanistan. The national government seems detached. The Taliban and Al Qaida operate in the FATA region. We haven't seen a concerted effort to root out those safe havens. We're undergoing a thorough review. General Petraeus and Richard Holbrooke are evaluating a regional approach. We need better coordination of military, diplomatic, and development efforts. This is difficult, but Afghanistan was the base for the 9/11 attacks. I met with 9/11 families, a reminder of the cost of those safe havens. We can't allow Al Qaida to operate there.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two of the key players in the insurance industry, America's Health Insurance Plans and BlueCross BlueShield, sent a letter to the Senate this morning saying that a government health insurance plan would, quote, dismantle, end quote, private insurers. Why are they wrong? And secondly, this public plan, is this nonnegotiable? Would you sign a health care bill without it? [SEP] Well, let's talk first of all about health care reform more broadly. I think in this debate, there's been some notion that if we just stand pat, we're okay. And that's just not true. You know, there are polls out that show that 70 or 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with the health insurance that they currently have. The only problem is that premiums have been doubling every 9 years, going up three times faster than wages. The U.S. Government is not going to be able to afford Medicare and Medicaid on its current trajectory. Businesses are having to make very tough decisions about whether we drop coverage or we further restrict coverage.So the notion that somehow we can just keep on doing what we're doing and that's okay, that's just not true. We have a longstanding critical problem in our health care system that is pulling down our economy, it's burdening families, it's burdening businesses, and it is the primary driver of our Federal deficits. All right?So if we start from the premise that the status quo is unacceptable, then that means we're going to have to bring about some serious changes. Now, what I've said is, our top priority has to be to control costs. And that means not just tinkering around the edges. It doesn't mean just lopping off reimbursements for doctors in any given year because we're trying to fix our budget. It means that we look at the kinds of incentives that exist, what our delivery system is like, why it is that some communities are spending 30 percent less than other communities but getting better health care outcomes, and figuring out how can we make sure that everybody is benefiting from lower costs and better quality by improving practices. It means health IT. It means prevention.So all these things are the starting point, I think, for reform. And I've said very clearly, if any bill arrives from Congress that is not controlling costs, that's not a bill I can support. It's going to have to control costs. It's going to have to be paid for. All right? So there's been a lot of talk about, well, a trillion-dollar price tag. What I've said is, if we're going to spend that much money, then it's going to be largely funded through reallocating dollars that are already in the health care system but aren't being spent well. If we're spending $177 billion over 10 years to subsidize insurance companies under Medicare Advantage, when there's no showing that people are healthier using that program than the regular Medicare program, well, that's not a good deal for taxpayers. And we're going to take that money, and we're going to use it to provide better care at a cheaper cost to the American people. So that's point number one.Number two, while we are in the process of dealing with the cost issue, I think it's also wise policy and the right thing to do to start providing coverage for people who don't have health insurance or are underinsured, are paying a lot of money for high deductibles. I get letters--two, three letters a day--that I read of families who don't have health insurance, are going bankrupt, are on the brink of losing their insurance, have deductibles that are so high that even with insurance they end up with fifty, a hundred thousand dollars worth of debt, are at risk of losing their homes.And that has to be part of reform, making sure that even if you've got health insurance now, you are not worried that when you lose your job or your employer decides to change policies that somehow you're going to be out of luck. I think about the woman who was in Wisconsin that I was with, who introduced me up in Green Bay--36 years old, double mastectomy; breast cancer has now moved to her bones, and she's got two little kids, a husband with a job. They had health insurance, but they're still $50,000 in debt, and she's thinking, my main legacy, if I don't survive this thing, is going to be leaving $100,000 worth of debt. So those are the things that I'm prioritizing.Now, the public plan, I think, is a important tool to discipline insurance companies. What we've said is, under our proposal, let's have a system the same way that Federal employees do, same way that Members of Congress do, where--we call it an exchange, but you can call it a marketplace--where essentially you've got a whole bunch of different plans. If you like your plan and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing. You keep your plan; you keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you good health insurance, terrific; we're not going to mess with it.But if you're a small-business person, if the insurance that's being offered is something you can't afford, if you want to shop for a better price, then you can go to this exchange, this marketplace, and you can look: Okay, this is how much this plan costs; this is how much that plan costs; this is what the coverage is like; this is what fits for my family. As one of those options, for us to be able to say, here's a public option that's not profit-driven, that can keep down administrative costs, and that provides you good, quality care for a reasonable price--as one of the options for you to choose, I think that makes sense.", "label": "Implicit"}

[SEP] Look, the most important thing we're doing is getting folks back to work; plain and simple. If we can create jobs, people will have the confidence to spend money, which will help businesses grow and hire more people. Secondly, we need to fix the credit markets. Too many businesses can't get loans, even if they're successful. Finally, we need to stabilize the housing market. The government can't do it alone, but we can work with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to reduce foreclosures and stabilize housing values.

I'll even help my friends out a bit on that last one. When I visit other countries, it's not my place to comment on candidates in the middle of a race. Governments tend to transcend whoever is in power. With respect to Brexit, the markets seem to have settled down a bit. We're monitoring for any systemic strains. Central banks and our Treasury Secretary have prepared well. There are longer-term concerns about global growth if Brexit freezes investment in Great Britain or Europe. We need to boost global demand. Whether it's the US improving infrastructure, or Germany spending more, or China shifting to domestic-based growth. With respect to Brexit negotiations, my message is: everyone should catch their breath, come up with an orderly, transparent plan. Both sides have a stake in getting this right. Leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved quickly. Chancellor Merkel's interest is in making sure the process works. We'll help in any way we can. As for the UK and a trade agreement, they'll be the least of their problems right now. Their first order of business is Europe. But the special relationship with Great Britain doesn't change.

Our relationship goes far deeper than any individual leaders. Canada, the US, and Mexico will continue to have close relationships. I look forward to working with whomever the American people elect as their President. I know we will always be able to find shared priorities. My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. We are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. In the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.We have reached so far—the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world—without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society—or the societies, at least, of our three countries—had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past—and President Obama already said it, even years back—but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms.

I told Putin that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is through a political transition that's inclusive, keeps the state and military intact, but gets rid of Assad. He's too toxic for Syrians to accept. I offered to work with Putin if he can convince Assad and Iran to agree to this transition. A military solution won't work; it'll just get them stuck in a quagmire. We all want to destroy ISIS, but Putin doesn't distinguish between ISIS and the moderate Sunni opposition. He thinks they're all terrorists, which is wrong. We're talking to Russia to avoid accidental clashes. We still believe Assad's the problem and his brutality must end. We're ready to work with anyone to achieve that, but we won't help Russia crush Assad's opposition. The moderate opposition is key to Syria's future. Russia's actions are weakening them and strengthening ISIS. Our train-and-equip program hasn't worked as planned, partly because the opposition is too busy fighting Assad to focus on ISIS. We're looking at what's worked, like our work with the Kurds, and building on that. We'll also keep working with the opposition because without a change in government, the civil war will continue, fueling ISIS. Putin went into Syria because Assad was crumbling. Sending arms and money wasn't enough; he had to send in his own forces. Nobody's buying his plan. Iran and Assad are his only allies. We have a coalition of 60 nations. Putin might realize it's in his interest to broker a political settlement. We're ready to work with Russia and Iran on that. It won't be easy, but it's possible. We need to talk, but only if there's a recognition that Assad has to go. We can't go back to the way things were. Russia's attacks on the moderate opposition are making things worse.", "label": "General"}

And how do you respond to Americans who feel Snowden's actions were justified in revealing surveillance practices? [SEP] Snowden is under indictment, so I need to be cautious.

They've been in power a long time, both him and his predecessor. Eventually, I expect things will change. But we haven't really implemented the toughest sanctions yet. We have that option. All options are on the table. We've only done sanctions that are right down the middle. We can get much tougher if necessary.

{"sentence": "Q. Are you considering, at any point, issuing an Executive order addressing mail-in ballots? And why do you think some people are pushing it so hard? [SEP] Well, there's never been a push like this for mail-in ballots. And if you look at the New York Congressional race, which is a disaster—Carolyn—it's been a total disaster. They have—they're 6 weeks into it now. They have no clue what's going on. And, I mean, I think I can say right here and now, I think you have to rerun that race, because it's a mess.Nobody knows what's happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots, I guess. I think you'd probably have to take the Carolyn Maloney race and run it over again. How can you do this? And this is a small race with literally thousands of people—small thousands—and it's all messed up.You look at Paterson, New Jersey, it's all messed up. Almost every one of these—and these are small, easy to control. They should be able to do this easy.Now you're talking about, like, Nevada, where last—2 nights ago, they went out and in the darkness of night without people, without having any meetings of the public, without having anything, they approved a ridiculous—you don't have to look at signatures. You don't have to approve anything. You can have double mailings. You can have all sorts of things. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It's a disgrace. I mean, honestly, it's a disgrace.So it's a very good question. I mean, the mail-in ballots, if you look at just some of the small places, the small races—congressional race in New York, it should be very easy. Normally, that would have been announced at 7 o'clock, and it would have been down to the wire and everybody would have loved it. If it was at all complex, it would have taken an extra 45 minutes or an hour, and they would have announced it a little bit later. They have no clue. This was about 6 weeks ago, and they have no clue what's going on.They've lost ballots. There's fraudulent ballots. It's—how are you going to do that for an entire nation? They're using COVID to try and get the mail-in ballots.Now, absentee ballots are great. Absentee ballots, they have to request them. They go through a process. They get them. But the universal mail-in ballots have turned out to be a disaster.And what Nevada has been doing—if you look, over the last few days, you have to look at what they've done. You can have two ballots, you can harvest—it's harvesting, so you can take thousands of ballots, put them together and just dump them down on somebody's desk after a certain period of time.They have something where, if you vote, the vote can count up to 7 days later. Well, if the vote is going to count 7 days later, that means you—you know, if it depends on the one State like Nevada, that would mean simply that you can't have—supposing it's down to that one State—it could be—it's a great State. But supposing it's down to that one State, that means you have to wait 7 days.But they won't have it there. This is something that's so messed up. And by the way, I have to say, the Post Office, for many, many years, has been, you know, run in a fashion that hasn't been great. Great workers and everything, but they have old equipment—very old equipment. And I don't think the Post Office is prepared for a thing like this. You'll have to ask the people at the Post Office. But how can the Post Office be expected to handle? They have regular mailing, and then now, on top of that, they have the internet, where you have Amazon and these companies doing, you know, all the buying—instead of going to a department store, they go buy through mail. So you have massive numbers of purchases now going through the Post Office, purchases of items and gifts, and that's a tremendous strain on the Post Office. The Post Office loses a fortune, and it has been for many, many years, for decades.So now, on top of it, it has this, and the Amazons of the world and the others, they pay very, very little money. They lose money on every—the Post Office loses money, which is ridiculous, on every package it delivers. But now, on top of that—and I'm not just referring to Amazon, I'm talking about all of the competitors, if there is such a thing, to Amazon. There will be. But if there is such a thing.But now, on top of that, you'll have somebody like the Governor of Nevada come out with this massive plan, out of nowhere, to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You'll never know who won that State. It will get messed up just like New York and just like Paterson, New Jersey and just like many other places.In West Virginia, they indicted a postman for doing something very bad. You know that. And—but there are many cases all over the country. If you look, you'll be able to find—there's a list of them all over the country. And that has to do with universal mail-in.Again, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they'll do absentee. It really works. But universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. To follow up on Jackie's question, you talked about providing assistance in Afghanistan for some time to come. But given the challenges there and the history in Afghanistan, what makes you think that after declaring victory in Afghanistan, that it won't slide back into becoming a haven for terrorists? [SEP] Well, I don't have a crystal ball. I think that right now the debate surrounding Afghanistan is presented as either we get up and leave immediately because there's no chance at a positive outcome, or we stay, basically, indefinitely and do, quote, unquote, whatever it takes for as long as it takes. And what I said last year, I will repeat, which is, we have a vital national interest in making sure that Afghanistan is not used as a base to launch terrorist attacks.It is true that Al Qaida right now is in Pakistan. And you'll often hear, Why are we in Afghanistan when the terrorists are in Pakistan? Well, Al Qaida is pinned down and has been weakened in part because they don't have the run of the territory. We would be less secure if you returned to a situation that existed prior to 9/11, in which they had a Government that was friendly to them and willing to house their operations. And I don't think anybody would dispute that.So A, we've got a vital interest in the region; B, we do not expect, because of our involvement in Afghanistan, that the country is going to completely transform itself in a year or 2 years or 5 years. President Karzai does not expect that; the Afghan people don't expect that. Afghanistan has its own culture. It is a very proud culture. It has a lot of work to do with respect to development, and it's going to have to find its own path.But I reject the notion that the Afghan people don't want some of the basic things that everybody wants: basic rule of law, a voice in governance, economic opportunity, basic physical security, electricity, roads, an ability to get a harvest to market and get a fair price for it without having to pay too many bribes in between. And I think we can make a difference and the coalition can make a difference in them meeting those aspirations, even as we are meeting our security interests. Those two things are tied together.Now, there has been a lot of obsession around this whole issue of when do we leave. My focus right now is how do we make sure that what we're doing there is successful, given the incredible sacrifices that our young men and women are putting in. And we have set up a mechanism whereby we are going to do a review--and I've signaled very clearly that we're not going to just keep on doing things if they're not working--and that by next year, we will begin a process of transition.That doesn't mean that we suddenly turn off the lights and let the door close behind us. And if you look at what's happening in Iraq right now, we have met every deadline. By the way, there was a timetable in place, and we are--we have--by the end of August, will have removed all of our combat troops from Iraq. We will maintain a military presence there, we will maintain military-to-military cooperation, and we are providing them assistance, but we're meeting this deadline.And I think it is worth the extraordinary sacrifices that we are making--and when I say we, not just the United States, but all coalition members--to try to see a positive outcome in Afghanistan as well.All right?

And I send him best wishes.With that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we've taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong. We essentially subsidized Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives. And that's what made Hong Kong—the exchange and business in Hong Kong—successful. I've taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business. You know, we really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom.But now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions and billions of dollars.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, as you contemplate the end of this war, can you justify the enormous human and financial costs, given that Afghanistan is somewhat less developed than initially hoped? President Karzai, do you still believe that foreign influence is largely to blame for Afghanistan's corruption and poor governance, and are you fully committed to stepping down as President after the elections next year? [SEP] We must remember why we went into Afghanistan. 3,000 Americans were brutally murdered by terrorists who were operating openly there. It was absolutely the right thing to do to go after that organization and the government that let them do it. Our troops and our Afghan friends have done a great job in achieving our main goal: to weaken Al Qaida so they can't attack us again. Everything we've done has been focused on that. We'll be able to say that the sacrifices made by our service members have achieved that goal. We also wanted a stable, sovereign Afghanistan, a responsible partner. That meant Afghanistan needed its own security and a path to prosperity and peace. Afghanistan still has work to do, but the chance of peace and prosperity is better now than before we went in. That's partly because of the sacrifices Americans have made. Did we achieve everything we imagined? Probably not. It's a human thing, you fall short sometimes. Did we achieve our main goal? Have we built a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government that will work with us to prevent future attacks? We're getting there. We thank our military, intelligence, and diplomatic teams, and the Afghan government and people. On corruption, there is corruption in Afghanistan. We're fighting it. We've made progress, but we're not satisfied. On foreign corruption in Afghanistan, I've said that Afghanistan needs cooperation from international partners to fix how assistance is delivered.

{"sentence": "Q. Has the American President calmed you in the sense that, on the policy of his successor on climate change and Russia, he has allayed your fears? And how—are you concerned that the common European policy towards Russia will collapse? And after the election of Mr. Trump, would you—as a sign of civility, wouldn't you actually have to declare that you are going to be a candidate again? [SEP] Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last 8 years. And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding.So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately, it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds. If I were here and I were German and I had a vote, I might support her. [] But it's—I don't know whether that hurts or helps. []With respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office. Russia is an important country. It is a military superpower. It has influence in the region, and it has influence around the world. And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation.I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing and they are having good relationships with their neighbors and participating constructively on big issues like climate change.So I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world.The values that we talked about—the values of democracy and free speech and international norms and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity—those things are not something that we can set aside. And so in—on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we've had very significant differences. And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.And I don't expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria—that we just do whatever is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we'll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together.I am encouraged by the President-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change. And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security, I think, is very important.And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election. As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyber attacks. This isn't new. It's not unique to Russia. There are a number of states where we've seen low-level cyber attacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds. And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, although we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering will sometimes take place even if we don't like it, there's a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we're monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening.I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don't see a cyber arms race. A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn't become a lawless, low-level battlefield.And we've started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G-20, the G-7, and at the U.N. levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front. Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I'm very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it is—it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly. Because this is all about the American people, it's about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming administration. And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. And that is in our mutual interest.So we will continue this. I will continue this with—I approach this with an open mind, and I'll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump.Secondly, on Russia, I can only repeat what the President said previously. This is all about respecting certain principles. And I'm saying this from a European vantage point, from a European—from a German vantage point, sorry. The fact that for over 70 years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts.But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts. This is why we launched the Normandy process, in close coordination with the United States of America. And particularly from a German perspective—from the European perspective—I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor. And just look at Poland—the sort of European perspective this has. So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one. We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share. But this mustn't keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements.And this is what I'm going to continue to work on with all my heart. So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to take you back to not this summit, but the one you hosted at Camp David a couple of days ago and whether you feel that you can ensure--assure investors there are contingency plans in place to cope, if Greece leaves the euro, to prevent a Lehman-like shock to the U.S. and the global economy? [SEP] We had an extensive discussion of the situation in the euro zone, and obviously, everybody is keenly interested in getting that issue resolved.I'm not going to speculate on what happens if the Greek choose to exit because they've got an election and this is going to be an important debate inside of Greece. Everybody who was involved in the G-8 summit indicated their desire to see Greece stay in the euro zone in a way that's consistent with the commitments that it's already--that have already been made. And I think it's important for Greece, which is a democracy, to work through what their options are at a time of great difficulty.I think we all understand, though, what's at stake. What happens in Greece has an impact here in the United States. Businesses are more hesitant to invest if they see a lot of uncertainty looming across the Atlantic because they're not sure whether that's going to mean a further global slowdown. And we're already seeing very slow growth rates and in fact contraction in a lot of countries in Europe. So we had an extensive discussion about how do we strengthen the European project, generally, in a way that does not harm world economic growth, but instead moves it forward.And I've been clear, I think, in--not just this week, but over the last 2 years about what I think needs to be done. We've got to put in place firewalls that ensure that countries outside of Greece that are doing the right thing aren't harmed just because markets are skittish and nervous.We've got to make sure that banks are recapitalized in Europe so that investors have confidence. And we've got to make sure that there is a growth strategy to go alongside the need for fiscal discipline, as well as a monetary policy that is promoting the capacity of countries--like a Spain or an Italy--that have put in place some very tough targets and some very tough policies to also offer their constituencies a prospect for the economy improving, job growth increasing, incomes expanding, even if it may take a little bit of time.And the good news was, you saw a consensus across the board, from newly elected President Hollande to Chancellor Merkel, to other members of the European community, that that balanced approach is what's needed right now. They're going to be meeting this week to try to advance those discussions further. We've offered to be there for consultation to provide any technical assistance and work through some of these ideas in terms of how we can stabilize the markets there.Ultimately, what I think is most important is that Europe recognizes this euro project involves more than just a currency. It means that there's got to be some more effective coordination on the fiscal and the monetary side and on the growth agenda. And I think that there was strong intent there to move in that direction. Of course, they've got 17 countries that have to agree to every step they take. So I think about my one Congress, then I start thinking about 17 congresses, and I start getting a little bit of a headache. It's going to be challenging for them.The last point I'll make is, I do sense greater urgency now than perhaps existed 2 years ago or 2 1/2 years ago. And keep in mind, just for folks here in the States, when we look backwards at our response in 2008 and 2009, there was some criticism because we had to make a bunch of tough political decisions.In fact, there's still criticism about some of the decisions we made. But one of the things we were able to do was to act forcefully to solve a lot of these problems early, which is why credit markets that were locked up started loosening up again. That's why businesses started investing again. That's why we've seen job growth of over 4 million jobs over the last 2 years. That's why corporations are making money, and that's why we've seen strong economic growth for a long time.And so acting forcefully, rather than in small, bite-sized pieces and increments, I think, ends up being a better approach, even though obviously we're still going through challenges ourselves. I mean, some of these issues are ones that built up over decades.All right? Stephen Collinson [Agence France-Presse]. Where's Stephen?", "label": "General"}

Consider the origins of this entire witch hunt, and hopefully, the truth will eventually surface. Numerous insightful books are being published that expose what they did to us. They've inflicted significant damage upon this nation. No other President should endure what I've experienced. The Ukrainian President is committed to combating corruption. There was corruption. Senators threatened him with withholding votes and financial aid. That's precisely what they're accusing me of doing, but I didn't. The call was flawless.

I'm not a Supreme Court Justice, so I'm not going to put on my constitutional law professor hat here. Let me focus on the issue of Libya. There's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened. Muammar Qadhafi, who, prior to Usama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect--provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground. I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interests and also because it's the right thing to do. We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies--who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations--have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in Benghazi; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope. So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the Members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics. And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down, and the noose is tightening around him. Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers Resolution, it came up after the Vietnam war in which we had half a million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent, and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments, you've got to consult with Congress beforehand. And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, hi. I want to revisit the issue of sacrifice. In 2009, you said that--expect the worst to come; we have not seen the worst yet. And now with these budget cuts looming, you have minorities, the poor, the elderly, as well as people who are scared of losing jobs, fearful. And also, what say you about Congressman Chaka Fattah's bill, the Debt Free America Act? Do you support that bill? Are you supporting the Republican bill that is similar to his, modeled after Congressman Fattah's bill? [SEP] Well, I'm not going to comment on a particular bill right now. Let me speak to the broader point that you're asking about, April.This recession has been hard on everybody, but obviously, it's harder on folks who've got less. And the thing that I am obsessed with, and have been since I came into office, is all those families out there who are doing the right thing every single day, who are looking after their families, who are just struggling to keep up and just feel like they're falling behind, no matter how hard they work.I got a letter this past week from a woman who--her husband had lost his job, had pounded the pavement, finally found a job. They felt like things were stabilizing for a few months. Six months later he lost his second job. Now they're back looking again and trying to figure out how they are going to make ends meet. And there are just hundreds of thousands of folks out there who really have seen as tough of an economy as we've seen in our lifetimes.Now, we took very aggressive steps when I first came into office to yank the economy out of a potential great depression and stabilize it. And we were largely successful in stabilizing it. But we stabilized it at a level where unemployment is still too high, and the economy is not growing fast enough to make up for all the jobs that were lost before I took office and the few months after I took office.So this unemployment rate has been really stubborn. There are a couple of ways that we can solve that. Number one is to make sure that the overall economy is growing. And so we have continued to take a series of steps to make sure that there's money in people's pockets that they can go out there and spend. That's what these payroll tax cuts were about.We've taken a number of steps to make sure that businesses are willing to invest, and that's what the small-business tax cuts and some of the tax breaks for companies that are willing to invest in plants and equipment--and zero capital gains for small businesses--that's what that was all about, was giving businesses more incentive to invest.We have worked to make sure that the training programs that are out there for folks who are having to shift from jobs that may not exist anymore so that they can get the training they need for the jobs that do exist, that those are improved and sharpened.We have put forward a series of proposals to make sure that regulations that may be unnecessary and are hampering some businesses from investing, that we are examining all of those for their costs and their benefits. And if they are not providing the kind of benefits in terms of the public health and clean air and clean water and worker safety that have been promised, then we should get rid of some of those regulations.So we've been looking at the whole menu of steps that can be taken. We are now in a situation where because the economy has moved slower than we wanted, because of the deficits and debt that result from the recession and the crisis, that taking a approach that costs trillions of dollars is not an option. We don't have that kind of money right now.What we can do is to solve this underlying debt and deficit problem for a long period of time so that then we can get back to having a conversation about, all right, since we now have solved this problem, that's not--no longer what's hampering economic growth, that's not feeding business and uncertainty, everybody feels that the ground is stable under our feet, are there some strategies that we could pursue that would really focus on some targeted job growth, infrastructure being a primary example.I mean, the infrastructure bank that we've proposed is relatively small. But could we imagine a project where we're rebuilding roads and bridges and ports and schools and broadband lines and smart grids, and taking all those construction workers and putting them to work right now? I can imagine a very aggressive program like that that I think the American people would rally around and would be good for the economy not just next year or the year after, but for the next 20 or 30 years.But we can't even have that conversation if people feel as if we don't have our fiscal house in order. Right? So the idea here is, let's act now. Let's get this problem off the table. And then with some firm footing, with a solid fiscal situation, we will then be in a position to make the kind of investments that, I think, are going to be necessary to win the future.So this is not a right or left, conservative/liberal situation. This is how do we operate in a smart way, understanding that we've got some short-term challenges and some long-term challenges. If we can solve some of those long-term challenges, that frees up some of our energies to be able to deal with some of these short-term ones as well.All right?

{"sentence": "Q. It's obviously emerging as a sticking point on the Hill. And are you concerned that arms to Iran will go to Hizballah or Hamas? And is there anything that you or a future President can do to stop that?And if you don't mind, I mean, I wanted to see if you could step back a little bit, and when you look at this Iran deal and all the other issues and unrest that's happening in the Middle East, what kind of Middle East do you want to leave when you leave the White House in a year and a half? [SEP] Good. So the issue of the arms embargo and ballistic missiles is of real concern to us, has been of real concern to us. And it is in the national security interest of the United States to prevent Iran from sending weapons to Hizballah, for example, or sending weapons to the Houthis in Yemen that accelerate a civil war there.We have a number of mechanisms under international law that gives us authority to interdict arms shipments by Iran. One of those mechanisms is the U.N. security resolution related to Iran's nuclear program. Essentially, Iran was sanctioned because of what had happened at Fordow, its unwillingness to comply with previous U.N. security resolutions about their nuclear program. And as part of the package of sanctions that was slapped on them, the issue of arms and ballistic missiles were included.Now, under the terms of the original U.N. resolution, the fact is that once an agreement was arrived at that gave the international community assurance Iran didn't have a nuclear weapon, you could argue, just looking at the text, that those arms and ballistic missile prohibitions should immediately go away.But what I said to our negotiators was, given that Iran has breached trust and the uncertainty of our allies in the region about Iran's activities, let's press for a longer extension of the arms embargo and the ballistic missile prohibitions. And we got that. We got 5 years in which, under this new agreement, arms coming in and out of Iran are prohibited. And we got 8 years with respect to ballistic missiles.But part of the reason why we were willing to extend it only for 5, let's say, as opposed to a longer period of time, is because we have other U.N. resolutions that prohibit arms sales by Iran to organizations like Hizballah. We have other U.N. resolutions and multilateral agreements that give us authority to interdict arms shipments from Iran throughout the region. And so we've had belts and suspenders and buttons, a whole bunch of different legal authorities. These legal authorities under the nuclear program may lapse after 5 or 8 years, but we'll still be in possession of other legal authorities that allow us to interdict those arms.And truthfully, these prohibitions are not self-enforcing. It's not like the U.N. has the capacity to police what Iran is doing. What it does is, is it gives us authority under international law to prevent arms shipments from happening in concert with our allies and our partners. And the real problem, if you look at how, for example, Hizballah got a lot of missiles that are a grave threat to Israel and many of our friends in the region, it's not because they were legal. It's not because somehow that was authorized under international law. It was because there was insufficient intelligence or capacity to stop those shipments.So the bottom line is, Carol, I share the concerns of Israel, Saudis, Gulf partners about Iran shipping arms and causing conflict and chaos in the region. And that's why I've said to them, let's double down and partner much more effectively to improve our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity so that fewer of those arms shipments are getting through the net.But the legal authorities we'll still possess. And obviously, we've got our own unilateral prohibitions and sanctions in place around nonnuclear issues, like support for Hizballah. And those remain in place.Now, in terms of the larger issues of the Middle East, obviously, that's a longer discussion. I think my key goal when I turn over the keys to the President—the next President is that we are on track to defeat ISIL, that they are much more contained, and we're moving in the right direction there; that we have jump-started a process to resolve the civil war in Syria, which is like an open sore in the region and is giving refuge to terrorist organizations who are taking advantage of that chaos; to make sure that in Iraq, not only have we pushed back ISIL, but we've also created an environment in which Sunni, Shia, and Kurd are starting to operate and function more effectively together; and to be in a conversation with all our partners in the region about how we have strengthened our security partnerships so that they feel they can address any potential threats that may come, including threats from Iran. And that includes providing additional security assurances and cooperation to Israel, building on the unprecedented cooperation that we have already put in place and support that we've already put in place. It includes the work that we've done with the GCC up at Camp David, making sure that we execute that.If we've done those things, then the problems in the Middle East will not be solved. And ultimately, it's not the job of the President of the United States to solve every problem in the Middle East. The people of the Middle East are going to have to solve some of these problems themselves. But I think we can provide that next President at least a foundation for continued progress in these various areas.The last thing I would say—and this is a longer term issue—is we have to address the youth in the region with jobs and opportunity and a better vision for the future so that they are not tempted by the nihilistic, violent dead end that organizations like ISIL offer. Again, we can't do that entirely by ourselves, but we can partner with well-intentioned organizations, states, NGOs, religious leaders in the region. We have to do a better job of that than we've been doing so far. Okay?All right. Michael Crowley [Politico].", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, President-elect Trump has suggested potentially lifting sanctions on Russia if they significantly reduce their nuclear arsenal. Given your own efforts in arms control, do you believe this is a viable strategy? Based on your experience in office and your understanding of Mr. Trump, what advice would you offer his advisors to help him navigate his relationship with Vladimir Putin effectively? And considering your recent actions regarding Russia, do you think these sanctions should be considered leverage in future negotiations? [SEP] Well, there are a few things to consider here. First and foremost, a constructive relationship with Russia is in the best interests of both America and the world. That's been my approach throughout my presidency. We've worked together where our interests have aligned. Early on, I tried to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community, helping them diversify and improve their economy, and use the talents of the Russian people in more productive ways. However, it's fair to say that after President Putin returned to the presidency, an escalating anti-American rhetoric and a global approach seemingly based on the idea that anything America does must be bad for Russia, leading them to counteract our efforts, has revived a Cold War-era adversarial spirit, making the relationship more difficult. This was further solidified when Russia intervened in Crimea and parts of Ukraine. The sanctions, as you recall, were not imposed due to nuclear weapons issues. They were a response to the violation of Ukraine's independence and sovereignty through force by Russia. This wasn't just our assessment; it was the consensus of the entire international community. Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory, meddle in Ukrainian affairs, and support military proxies who have violated fundamental international law and norms. I've communicated to the Russians that the sanctions will be lifted as soon as they cease these actions. To maintain international norms, it's crucial that we don't conflate the reasons for these sanctions with other unrelated issues. Regarding nuclear matters, we negotiated the START II Treaty during my first term, significantly reducing nuclear stockpiles for both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further and conveyed this to President Putin, but they were unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump can restart those talks in a meaningful way, there's still considerable potential for further stockpile reductions. Our success in nonproliferation and nuclear security has been partly due to leading by example. I hope that continues. However, it's essential to remember that the sanctions against Russia are a direct result of their actions in Ukraine. The United States must uphold the fundamental principle that larger countries cannot invade and bully smaller ones. I've stated before that I expect Russia and Ukraine to maintain a strong relationship, given their historical, cultural, and social ties. However, Ukraine is an independent nation. This situation exemplifies the vital role America must continue to play in preserving basic norms and values globally, whether advocating for human rights, women's rights, or freedom of the press. The United States hasn't always been perfect in this regard. At times, we must engage with allies and partners who may not fully meet our desired standards for international rules and norms. However, I can assure you that in every multilateral forum—the United Nations, the G-20, the G-7—the United States has consistently championed these values. It's crucial for us to continue doing so, because if the largest, strongest democracy in the world isn't willing to stand up for these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.", "label": "Dodging"}

How much do you support President Uribe, considering the paramilitary leaders are often drug traffickers? Will the U.S. insist on extradition? [SEP] I support a system where an independent judiciary investigates all charges, and those found guilty are punished. That's the plan President Uribe supports. There are no political favorites when it comes to justice. A fair court, independent from politics, is the best way to ensure justice. President Uribe assured me that his government has an independent court and firm laws, and that people will be held accountable regardless of their political affiliations.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the trade imbalance with China, critics argue that your administration's policies haven't significantly altered the situation. How do you respond to concerns that the RMB's undervaluation continues to hinder American job growth? [SEP] Look, it's not just about the RMB. It's about the whole shebang, the whole economic relationship. I remember back in '09, at that G20, we were staring into the abyss. The financial crisis was a real mess. And we knew we couldn't keep going down that road, with the U.S. borrowing and consuming like crazy, not producing, not selling. That's why we pushed for a global rebalancing. Now, that means we gotta save more, cut the debt, both public and private. We gotta get our act together, be more competitive. Best education, more engineers, less lawyers, fix our fiscal problems, build world-class infrastructure. That's all part of it. But, yeah, we need a level playing field. With China, it's about making sure it's a win-win, not a win-lose. Some of it's not even about currency. We're getting somewhere on government procurement, making it fair for American businesses. We're making progress on intellectual property. Steve Ballmer was just telling me, only one in ten of their products are actually paid for in China. Can we get better enforcement? China's taken steps, but more needs to be done. The currency thing is part of it. The RMB is undervalued. They've spent billions to keep it that way. President Hu says he wants a market-based system, but it's not happening fast enough. I told him, it's good for both of us. U.S. businesses can sell more, and China can boost domestic demand. A stronger RMB means they can buy more, raise their standard of living. It's a win-win. He's worried about the transition, the disruptions. But I'm confident he'll do the right thing and move towards a fully market-based currency. It'll be good for everyone.", "label": "Deflection"}

What, in your opinion, is driving this trend, and what steps will your administration take to address it? [SEP] It's a very sad situation. I detest seeing it. And, as you know, I've accomplished more for Israel than any other President. Prime Minister Netanyahu himself acknowledged this. Jerusalem, protection, collaboration – numerous things. But the most significant is Jerusalem. Many Presidents have spoken about building the Embassy in Jerusalem, but it never occurred. Designating it as the capital – never happened. But I made it happen, and promptly. And we constructed the Embassy. It would have taken many years and cost billions, but we did it for a minimal amount. It's already complete.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Were you premature in saying that the U.S. economy is not in a recession when food and energy prices are soaring so high?And what more can you do to persuade Saudi Arabia during your upcoming visit to reconsider output levels and cut prices? [SEP] Yes. Look, I mean, you know, the words on how to define the economy don't reflect the anxiety the American people feel. The average person doesn't really care what we call it. The average person wants to know whether or not we know that they're paying higher gasoline prices and that they're worried about staying in their homes. And I do understand that. That's why we've been aggressively helping people refinance their homes. That's why I continue to call upon Congress to pass legislation that will enable people to stay in their homes.These are tough times. People—economists can argue over the terminology. But—and these are difficult times, and the American people know it. And they want to know whether or not Congress knows it. I think an important signal to send on energy, just like I said, is to say, okay, we're going to go find oil here at home.We can—we're transitioning to a new era, by the way, a new era where we're going to have batteries in our cars that will power—enable people to drive 40 miles on electricity. There's going to be more ethanol on the market, more alternative fuels. It would be—our driving habits will change. But in the meantime, we need to be sending a signal to the world markets that we intend to explore here in America. We can also send a clear signal that we understand supply and demand. And then when you don't build a refinery for 30 years, it's going to be a part of restricting supply, and therefore, we ought to expand our refining capacity by permitting new refineries and getting after it quickly.On the electricity front, as you know, I'm a big believer in nuclear power, except we keep getting mixed signals out of Congress, and the regulatory system sends mixed signals.And so—and then to your question on the Saudis, look, I have made the case that the high price of oil injures economies. But I think we better understand that there's not a lot of excess capacity in this world right now. Hopefully, high prices will spur more exploration to bring excess capacity on, but demand is rising faster than supply. And that's why you're seeing global energy prices rise. And that's why it's important for us to try to take the pressure off by saying, we're going to start exploring here at home.John [John Yang, NBC News].", "label": "Implicit"}

Our transition out of a combat role has not changed. Risks exist in Afghanistan, but casualties have decreased substantially since our shift away from combat. Afghan security services are fighting with courage and improving. While some rotations may be extended, we've reduced our presence from 100,000 to under 10,000 troops, who are not in combat roles.

What is your opinion on the constitutionality of the debt limit? And do you consider marriage to be a civil right? [SEP] Chuck, that's quite a collection of questions! Perhaps you should be nominated to the Supreme Court! However, I am not a Supreme Court Justice, so I will refrain from donning my constitutional law professor persona. Let us concentrate on the essence of the matter at hand. There has been excessive emphasis on procedural aspects and insufficient attention to the substantive issues. Muammar Qadhafi, who bore responsibility for more American fatalities than nearly anyone preceding Usama bin Laden, was poised to perpetrate a massacre upon his own populace. As part of an international coalition, operating under a United Nations mandate of unprecedented scope, we neutralized his air defense systems, enabling the coalition to enforce a no-fly zone and safeguard the civilians on the ground. I assured the American people that we would not deploy ground troops and that we would not bear the predominant burden of the operation. We have adhered precisely to our commitments. Our allies have assumed a significant portion of the responsibility, and we have successfully protected thousands of individuals in Libya. There have been no American casualties, and there is no risk of further escalation. The operation is circumscribed in both duration and extent. We have maintained ongoing consultations with Congress throughout this process. Therefore, much of the current uproar is politically motivated. Our actions align precisely with our stated objectives, conducted under a United Nations mandate, and have resulted in the preservation of countless lives. Qadhafi is now under siege. The War Powers Resolution emerged in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, during which we had deployed half a million soldiers and suffered tens of thousands of casualties. Congress sought to prevent a recurrence of such events. I believe that consultation is entirely appropriate; however, our actions do not, in any way, contravene the War Powers Resolution.

First, do you feel betrayed by some of these people who have served you and then have come out and criticized you? And then, more particularly, can you respond to Greenspan's criticism? [SEP] My feelings are not hurt. You might have been a little selective in quoting Donald Rumsfeld, which I know you didn't mean to be, you know. I respect Secretary Rumsfeld; I believe he did a fine job. And I respect Alan Greenspan. I respectfully disagree with Alan Greenspan when it comes to saying that this administration didn't handle the fiscal issues we faced in good fashion. As a matter of fact, we did.The deficit, as a percent of GDP, is low. It's lower than the 30-year average. We have submitted a plan to balance the budget. We dealt with a recession, a terrorist attack, and corporate scandals. And we did it by cutting taxes. The tax cuts worked. The economy recovered. People are working. Interest rates are low.I'm a supply-sider. I believe supply-side economics, when properly instituted, enables us to achieve certain objectives. One, there's people finding work, and there's hope in the economy. Two, that supply-side economics yields additional tax revenues. And if we're smart about how we manage the fiscal budget, it leads to balance, and that's what we have done. We are fighting a war at the same time that we're headed toward balance. In other words, we're making sure our troops get the money they need and veterans get the benefits they need.The former Chairman Greenspan and I spent a lot of time talking about the unfunded liabilities inherent in Social Security and Medicare. And he's concerned about those unfunded liabilities, as am I.

We've neglected domestic hydrocarbon production for too long, and now we're paying the price. We should have been exploring for oil and gas in ANWR, for example. Congress blocked us from opening new areas for environmentally responsible exploration, making us more dependent on foreign oil. Fortunately, Canada and Mexico are major suppliers, and we're grateful for that. But our energy policy hasn't been effective, and we're seeing the consequences. There's also limited excess capacity globally. Unfortunately, many supplies come from politically unstable regions. Again, Canada and Mexico are exceptions. Some countries aren't reinvesting in their reserves, leading to declines. I'm concerned for our consumers. That's why we passed the tax relief. Congress should make it permanent.

[SEP] The Medal of Freedom is a recognition of Chancellor Merkel's remarkable career. She has been an excellent steward of the German economy and the European project. She represents the unification of Europe through her own life story and the capacity to overcome the past and point towards a brighter future. The extraordinary work that she's already done would by itself merit the Medal of Freedom. Fortunately, she's going to be around quite a bit longer. Her leadership will be critical on economic issues of the sort that we just discussed in the euro zone. I compliment her on the courage with which she approaches some of these very difficult political issues, at some significant political costs to herself. On the international stage, there's no issues that we don't coordinate closely with Germany. Our work in Afghanistan, our work together with NATO, the approach that we've taken with respect to the Middle East and the Arab Spring, our approaches to development issues and how we help the poorest countries find their place in the international economy, these are all going to be areas where Angela's leadership will be welcomed and will be absolutely critical for us to be able to achieve the kind of more peaceful and prosperous world that we want to see. She's not finished yet; she's got a lot more work to do. Well, I believe when you see me standing here before you today and receiving this prestigious award of the Medal of Freedom, it will perhaps also be a moment where one needs to look back to 1989 and German unification and what actually happened there. Germany entered into a qualitatively new phase. We were all of a sudden a reunited country, a country with all rights, but also with all the obligations. If I think back to the beginning of the nineties, we were struggling for a decision that would enable us to send ships on the Adria, taking part in reconnaissance missions. And if you compare this to where we are today, you see the road that we have traveled in the direction of assuming more international responsibility. Military missions, participating in military missions are part and parcel of that: on the Balkans, in UNIFIL, in Afghanistan, in combating piracy, and in many other areas. What's also important in this context is that we need to combine military and civil engagement. We share this approach, Barack and I. We live up to our international responsibilities. The world is full of problems that we need to address. You cannot have enough partners that work together with you in a coordinated way, and this is why this cooperation is so extremely important for our common future. I'm saying this also as someone who comes from Europe. The changes in North Africa are changes that happen on our doorstep. Those are our immediate neighbors, and we have a choice. Either this works out well or we have an enormous refugee problem. It's not only out of charity that we help people. There's not only a moral obligation.

{"sentence": "Q. And, President Duda, if I could just throw one your way as well: You said in the Oval Office earlier that democracy in Poland was strong. Not all of your European Union counterparts agree with that. How is forcing Supreme Court justices to retire early consistent with democratic principles? And, President Trump, is that something that you support? [SEP] No. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very complex issue. And it's hard to answer this question because a lot of people in Western Europe—I think also in the U.S.—do not fully understand this problem because they have not grown up in a country such as mine.I was born in 1972, in a Poland which was in the Russian sphere of influence, in which a career could be made only, actually, when somebody enrolled as member of the Communist Party and who followed these people's power who was the supreme authority. And this is what was happening for many years.Although, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, as Solidarity movement grew, people were imprisoned, people were tortured, people were killed during the martial law, and after as well—be it openly or in a secret way. And this was the reality of Poland until 1989.And now imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that no so long ago—a few years ago—I was surprised to discover that, in the Polish Supreme Court, there was a whole group of justices who were issuing sentencing as judges—members of the Communist Party—before 1990, who were even passing sentences during the martial law, sentencing people to prisons based on the law of the Communist martial law.And when I was asked whether the Supreme Court needs to be reformed, I said yes. If Poland is supposed to be a truly democratic, free, and sovereign country, if it is supposed to be a country we want it to be for our children, for the generation who was born after, in 1989, then for God's sake, those people have to leave. They have to retire. And this is what we did.As a matter of fact, everything that we were doing was aimed at retiring those people. But, as you can see, unfortunately, although 30 years have passed, they have got influence, the influence which they were building after 1989 where they assumed a new identity of an elite of a new state. So this influence is still strong. This is what I can say.And let me assure you of one thing: that freedom of speech is absolutely respected in Poland. Poland absolutely respects all constitutional standards, just as in the United States: the right to assemble; the right to the freedom of speech. There is free media in Poland. There is everything that is functioning in a normal democracy.One can announce what they think, one can demonstrate, one can say what they think. In Poland, people are not attacked during demonstrations as it happens in other Western European countries. Police do not use truncheons or tear gas against people. People can speak their mind. They can express that they're not pleased with something. This is their right in democracy.Please ask Polish journalists, When was the last time—when was the last demonstration in Poland when some kind of tension happened? No, it didn't, because in Poland we respect the right to demonstrate and to express your concern, because we believe that this is one of the foundations of democracy. In Poland, there is absolutely free and just elections. All the standards are respected.So, please, ladies and gentleman, come to Poland and see Poland with your own eyes. Please do not repeat certain stereotypes that are repeated in the West. Poland, today, has got quite a conservative government, that is true. And this government has got certain standards of action. Not everybody subscribes to those standards, especially people of more leftist views. But this is the nature of democracy.So once you have got one side of the political scene in power, and then people make a different choice and another side of the political stage comes to power.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning Ukraine and the reported 30,000 Russian troops at the border, what guarantees can you provide to Eastern Ukraine, the Baltic nations, Moldova, and others regarding possible Russian annexation? Also, is Crimea now a 'fait accompli,' or do you think Putin might return it, or is this merely a show of strength to deter further territorial seizures? [SEP] Regarding Crimea, it's not a 'fait accompli' because the global community largely does not recognize the annexation. Russian forces control Crimea, and some locals support it. Removal by force is unlikely. We are exerting legal, diplomatic, political, and economic pressure. A straightforward resolution is improbable. History is unpredictable. The situation's development hinges on international solidarity in condemning Russia's actions. As for Russian troops near Ukraine, they are within Russia. We oppose intimidation, but Russia has the right to station troops on its territory. Russia is still deliberating. These calculations depend on US, European, and international unity in rejecting 21st-century dispute resolution methods. It is crucial to reject claims that Russian speakers in Ukraine are threatened to justify Russian action. There is no evidence of threats. Provocateurs have instigated unrest. Comparisons to Kosovo, where thousands were massacred, are absurd. We must debunk justifications for Russian action. For non-NATO border states, like Ukraine, we are applying international pressure, highlighting the situation, and strengthening their economies. NATO members have Article 5 protection. We are enhancing contingency plans. A NATO ministerial will further develop these plans. NATO members are resolute.

{"sentence": "Q. Do you trust that they are sincere about this? [SEP] I do. I think they want to make a deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night, very late in the night. I see an alert—or, as you would call it, breaking news. And it was that the Vice Chairman—we're not talking about somebody from China at a low level—the Vice Chairman of China came out that he wants to see a deal made, he wants it to be made under calm conditions, using the word calm. I agree with him on that.And China has taken a very hard hit over the last number of months. You know, they've lost 3 million jobs. It will soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking. A chain is breaking up like nobody has seen before. And once that happens, it's very hard to put it back together. You understand.I think they want—very much want—to make a deal. And the longer they wait, the harder it is to put it back, if it can be put back at all. So I believe they want to do a deal.The tariffs have hit them very hard in a fairly short period of time. The United States will have collected over $100 billion in tariffs. And I say it again: The reporters failed to—the media failed to acknowledge it. But if you look at the goods coming in from China—we're talking about China, not other countries. If you look at the goods, they have a power that others don't have. But that power is only good for so long.They've manipulated their currency, they've devalued their currency, and they put a lot of cash into the system. And because of that, the prices have not gone up. Or if they've gone up, it's been very little, because they want to keep people working. If the prices go up, they're not going to be able to keep people working; they're not going to be able to compete. It's a brilliant market. It's a brilliant, brilliant market, the world market. A lot of markets are brilliant.And frankly, I think that China cannot—I don't know, maybe they can, maybe they can't. I don't think they can do that. And I think they're very smart. And I think President Xi is a great leader, who happens to be a brilliant man. And he can't lose 3 million jobs in a very short period of time. And that's going to be magnified many times over. And it's going to break down the Chinese system of trade, and he can't do that.So when you say, Do you think they want to? Maybe they want to, and maybe they don't. But I think they want to make a deal. I'm not sure they have a choice. And I don't say that as a threat. I don't think they have a choice. In the meantime, the United States, which has never collected 10 cents from China, will, in a fairly short period of time, be over $100 billion in tariffs.

I wouldn't tell them to stop. I'd tell them to vote, organize, and stay informed. Don't take our government for granted. Democracy takes work. If people don't vote, democracy suffers. If we can't tell facts from lies, we're in trouble. If people won't compromise, democracy falls apart. Know what makes democracy work and be a citizen. Some forget the Cold War. Sometimes, people equate the U.S. and Russia. We have flaws, but we try to do what's right. The U.S. has been good to Germany. We've helped them. We try to have free speech and fight corruption.

{"sentence": "As you embark on your final foreign trip, what can you tell world leaders who are concerned about your successor, Donald Trump, and the future of U.S. foreign policy? And, following the Democratic Party's recent defeat, what advice do you have for the party's future direction and leadership? [SEP] Well, one of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.", "label": "Implicit"}

They're not suppression polls; they're real polls. You look at the Intracostal in Florida. You look at the lakes. You see thousands of boats with Trump signs, American signs. You've got the Trump-Pence sign all over. You look at what's going on.

They were very proud of it.But we had, in 2016, something even more so, but we got in, and we had 306 to, I guess, 223, which was a tremendous margin of difference.

I just opened it up. And I just got rid of tariffs in China. And we're working on European Union, which charge our fishermen tariffs. And I said, You're not going to do that. So we freed it up for Maine.But if you take a look, we went up there recently. There were crowds. Thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for—we're making swabs. A beautiful, big, new factory, making swabs.I think that the enthusiasm now is greater—and maybe far greater—than it was in 2016. I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it. I think they're not going to say: Hey, I'm for Trump. I'm for Trump. They don't want to go through the process. And I fully understand that, because the process is not fair.

At that point, nobody understood what the depths of this recession were going to look like. If you recall, it was only significantly later that we suddenly get a report that the economy had tanked.And so it's not surprising then that we missed the mark in terms of our estimates of where unemployment would go.

My administration is exploring all available options to strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws and prevent weapons from falling into the hands of criminals.

Special interest groups finance campaigns and exploit fear. While the Republican Party is particularly resistant, this issue transcends party lines. We must transform this dynamic. Citizens must prioritize gun safety when casting their votes, even if it means setting aside other concerns temporarily. The NRA has been remarkably effective in mobilizing their base and influencing politicians. We must match their intensity and organization. We cannot eliminate all violence, but our homicide rates far exceed those of comparable nations. I am profoundly saddened by recent events.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, gentlemen. Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, Phil Coorey from the Financial Review. To you, Mr. Trump, just on the region and China and associated issues, the United States Navy has conducted, frequently, freedom-of-navigation sail-throughs through the disputed areas. Would you like to see the Australian Navy participate directly in those operations alongside their U.S. allies?And whilst on the region, could I ask you what your latest thinking is on the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Are you softening your opposition to that, or do you remain as opposed as ever? [SEP] Well, I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership was not a good deal for us. And if they made it a good deal for us, I'd go in. But honestly, it wasn't. I like bilateral deals much more than multilateral. I like to be able to negotiate with one country. And if it doesn't work out, you terminate. And during the termination notice, right after you consent, they call you and they say, Please, let's make a deal, and you fix the deal. When you get into multi, you can't do that.But Trans-Pacific Partnership—TPP—was a very bad deal for the United States. It would have cost us tremendous amounts of jobs. It would have been bad. But there's a possibility we would go in, but they will be offering us a much better deal. I would certainly do that.As far as your lanes are concerned, we'd love to have Australia involved, and I think Australia wants us to stay involved. I have to say, we've developed a great relationship with China, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time—killing us, absolutely killing the United States on trade.But we have developed a great relationship with China—probably closer than we've ever had. And my personal relationship, as Malcolm can tell you, with President Xi is, I think, quite extraordinary. He's somebody that I like, and I think he likes me. With that being said, he likes China and I like the United States. []But a lot of things are happening. It's going to be a very interesting period of time. But we do have to straighten out. And as much I like and respect—really respect President Xi, we have to straighten out the trade imbalance. It's too much. It's no good. Okay. Kieran Gilbert from Sky News.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "What message do you believe the American electorate conveyed last week? And is there still an opportunity for the 'course correction' you previously mentioned before our European allies make critical decisions? [SEP] I think Americans understand that the world is smaller now, more connected. You can't put that genie back in the bottle. They know their careers, or their kids' careers, might be more fluid, not a single job for 30 years, but maybe changing careers, getting more education, retraining. And I think they're up for it. They just want a fair playing field. Most Americans still support trade, but they worry about fairness, about equal access to markets. Is it just a race to the bottom for wages? I argued, unsuccessfully so far, that TPP would address these concerns, strengthening worker and environmental rights, leveling the field, benefiting American workers and businesses. But that's a tough sell when people remember plant closures and offshoring. So, the election reflected a desire for that course correction. Messages about stopping immigration surges and unfair trade deals resonated. Now, governing requires a more nuanced approach. We need orderly, lawful immigration, which is good for our economy, keeping us young and dynamic. Entrepreneurs and risk-takers come here. That's why America has been successful. When it comes to trade, eliminating deals like with Mexico isn't simple. Global supply chains exist. Parts from Mexico keep auto plants running double shifts. So, progressives need to acknowledge real concerns, real anxieties, and offer solutions: higher minimum wage, stronger worker protections, stronger financial regulations, fair trade that prevents child labor, attention to inequality. That's the strategy. And I think we can succeed. The world will still look to us. Our example matters. The way to make everyone feel part of the global economy isn't to isolate ourselves, but to work together better.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. But you think you've been realistic about the strategy and what's possible? [SEP] Well—thank you for the followup—nothing has changed in the new room. Anyway—yes. I mean, as I told you last November, right about this time, I was part of that group of Americans who didn't approve of what was taking place in Iraq, because it looked like all the efforts that we had taken to that point in time were about to fail. In other words, sectarian violence was really raging. And I had a choice to make, and that was to pull back, as some suggested, and hope that the chaos and violence that might occur in the capital would not spill out across the country or send more troops in to prevent the chaos and violence from happening in the first place, and that's the decision I made. So it was a realistic appraisal, by me.What's realistic, as well, is to understand the consequences of what will happen if we fail in Iraq. In other words, it's—people aren't just going to be content with driving America out of Iraq. Al Qaida wants to hurt us here. That's their objective. That's what they would like to do. They have got an ideology that they believe that the world ought to live under, and that one way to help spread that ideology is to harm the American people, harm American interests. The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11th, and that's why what happens in Iraq matters to the security here at home.So I've been realistic about the consequences of failure. I have been realistic about what needs to happen on the ground in order for there to be success. And it's been hard work, and the American people see it as hard work. And one of the reasons it is hard work is because on our TV screens are these violent killings perpetuated by people who have done us harm in the past.

Because I've made it clear from the beginning that we will do what we need to defend ourselves and our allies – South Korea and Japan. And that would put us more in China's face. But that wouldn't be because of China, it would be because of North Korea's actions. We've put together teams to engage with their counterparts in China to work on these issues.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Kenya, what specific measures will the U.S. take to assist in the fight against al-Shabaab? Do you still consider Somalia a viable counterterrorism model? And are you concerned about potential human rights abuses by Kenyan authorities under the guise of counterterrorism? And for President Kenyatta, what further assistance do you require from the U.S. in combating al-Shabaab, and are you satisfied with the current level of support? Also, could you both address the criticism surrounding the treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals in Kenya? [SEP] Well, this has been a topic of extensive discussion and concrete action that we're now undertaking. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya dealing with primarily threats from al-Shabaab. In part because of the actions that we've taken not just with Kenya, but with AFRICOM, and the efforts, collectively, of countries to work together—Uganda, Ethiopia, others—we have systematically reduced the territory that al-Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa. That doesn't mean the problem is solved. As is true around the world, what we find is, is that we can degrade significantly the capacities of these terrorist organizations, but they can still do damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall were not large, but when they're willing to target soft targets and civilians, and are prepared to die, they can still do a lot of damage. And so what we discussed was the importance of, number one, continuing the effort to root out al-Shabaab's capacity inside of Somalia, working jointly. And as we speak, Kenya is working with Ethiopia and with the United States and others to further degrade al-Shabaab's space of operations inside of Somalia. So we have to keep that pressure going, even as we're strengthening the Somalian Government. Because part of the reason that al-Shabaab was able to emerge as a significant threat to the region was a nonfunctioning Government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long. There is now a Government and a cabinet that is credible and is working with the international community in Mogadishu. And even as we put military pressure on al-Shabaab, we also have to make sure that we're standing up an effective governance structure inside of Somalia. And we've made progress there. In addition, we have to continue to make progress in intelligence-sharing and being able to identify and prevent threats before they occur here in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. And part of our announcement today involves additional funding, additional assistance that we're providing the Kenyan security forces to deal with these very specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to make sure that the approach that's taken in rooting out potential terrorist threats don't create more problems than they're solving. And this goes to the other element of the question that you asked. What we have found, sometimes through hard experience—and I shared this with —is that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you are restricting legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, then that can have the inadvertent effect of actually increasing the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in communities that feel marginalized. And I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, part of the reason why, although we're seeing potential lone wolf attacks inside the United States, that we have not seen this sort of systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim communities or immigrant communities inside of the United States is, is that we've been very conscious to make sure that law enforcement is reaching out and cooperating and working with them, because they are our partners in this process. And the only way we're going to fight the poison that's being fed to them—to their young people through social media—is to make sure that they're our eyes and our ears and they're counseling us on how we can more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. And that's proven successful. The same will be true here in Kenya. And I was very clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people, and it will find its way through this process in cooperation with us, but our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society—in fact, embracing civil society, particularly in those communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab—that becomes more important the more significant the threat is. And not only is that practical advice, but it's the right thing to do, and it's consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and with the values that you heard espouse. Similarly, with respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this. I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. And I say that, recognizing that there may be people who have different religious or cultural beliefs. But the issue is, how does the state operate relative to people? If you look at the history of countries around the world, when you start treating people differently—not because of any harm they're doing anybody, but because they are different—that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. And when a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread. And as an African American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there's—were all sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong. So I'm unequivocal on this. If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs—and doing all the other things that good citizens are supposed to do and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop. And the state does not need to weigh in on religious doctrine. The state just has to say, we're going to treat everybody equally under the law. And then, everybody else can have their own opinions. All right?", "label": "Dodging"}

Realistically, how likely is it that nations with long-standing disagreements will now cooperate effectively? What enforcement mechanisms are in place? [SEP] Let's consider Ukraine as a concrete example. For a decade, we've urged them to either export or convert their highly enriched uranium. Partly due to this conference, Ukraine has committed to completing this process in the next few years. These commitments predate the communique and work plan, indicating a strong consensus on the issue's global threat. We also have international conventions, though not all ratified, including by the U.S. regarding nuclear terrorism and trafficking. This sets a bold plan, and I'm encouraged by progress on long-delayed efforts, some dating back to the Cold War, now materializing at this summit.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Q. Let me confess that I'll probably have more than one question myself. I'll be quick. President Obama, you said you're concerned with regard to defense cuts in NATO countries, but you said that freedom doesn't come without a cost. But Europe is coming out of a very hard crisis, difficult crisis, and we know that we need austerity in many sectors, including in defense. And in fact, there's a debate ongoing right now in Italy on a possible reduction in the commissioning F-35. So how can we reconcile the need to have fiscal discipline and to keep military spending under control? Now, you spoke about structural reforms. Do you think that's the best way to reinvigorate the country?Now, to the Prime Minister, did you talk about the Italian Marine riflemen during your talks? [SEP] When it comes to defense spending, all of us have to make sure that our defense forces are efficient, effective; that for every dollar or lira that we're spending, that we're getting the most defense for our money.And so in the United States, we've reduced our defense spending as we've brought two wars to a close. There's a natural transition. The kinds of spending increases that we had seen were unsustainable. And I recognize that in Europe—and I discussed this with both as well as President Napolitano—there are opportunities for greater efficiencies, not only within a country's own defenses, but also by collaborating between European countries so that you don't have too much duplication and excess capacity. And in fact, Secretary General Rasmussen has repeatedly put forward plans for building NATO defense capacity in ways that reduce duplication and ensure that we are getting the most for our money.But having said that, there is a certain irreducible commitment that countries have to make if they're serious about NATO and the defense alliance. And I've been very realistic, I think, with my European partners: We, the United States, obviously have the largest military in the world, and we recognize we have some extraordinary responsibilities. We don't expect every country to duplicate exactly what we do. We have responsibilities in the Middle East. We have responsibilities in Asia, Latin America. We welcome those responsibilities, and we understand that that is a particular role that we play. But we're also a partnership in NATO, and it—we can't have a situation in which the United States is consistently spending over 3 percent of our GDP on defense, much of that focused on Europe, potentially more if we end up having ongoing crises within Europe, and Europe is spending, let's say, 1 percent. The gap becomes too large.Obviously, small countries will still be having a lot less capacity than us, but proportionally to their GDP, we need to make sure that everybody is doing their fair share. That's not just for our benefit, it's also because Europe is going to have its own unique defense needs. spoke about the Mediterranean. Conceivably, Italy is going to develop more and more specialized capacity in addressing particular challenges in North Africa or in other parts of the Mediterranean. Well, that's going to require some resources in order to do that. So this is not something that's going to have to happen overnight, but there has to be a trajectory that recognizes the need for everybody pitching in, because we—as I said yesterday, we cannot take our freedom for granted.[] Yes, we did speak about the two riflemen who are being illegally detained in India. And I thanked the U.S. and the U.S. Government for the support that they've given us in this phase of the international discussion, and I've asked to be able to count on further support. We want the issue to be dealt with at an ever more international level.But I need to be honest with you, and therefore, I need to say something about the questions that you addressed to , but also to the Italian Government. In other words, I agree; I know what means when he says that freedom cannot come free of charge. And we cannot complain that there is pain and suffering in the world unless we wish to deal with these problems through an alliance based on freedom and democracy, and common and shared values. We have to shoulder our responsibilities.And I think that Italy always has done its share over the years. We know where our strengths are, what the numbers are, but I think we've always been highly devoted and deeply committed. And I thank for having yet—recognized yet again the strong partnership between our countries. I mean, when Italians have been asked to shoulder responsibilities, they've always tried to do it with the utmost commitment and honor.And I think that over the coming years, we're going to have to insist on the concept that was just illustrated by the President; i.e., we have to become specialized, especially in certain areas. We cannot keep saying that the EU has a role to play and then pull back and say, well, the U.S. is there, and they're always going to come to support us in the end. That's not right. It's not fair. We are partners, and we have to work together. I agree with Now, the issues—and the President said quite rightly—pertaining to efficiencies and making our system more efficient, our public administration, we have to reduce costs there and in the defense sector. I mean, it's there for everyone to see. We wish to continue cooperating and collaborating with our partners. And we will, therefore, keep checking our budgets to make sure that we have the resources to intervene all over the world. And at the same time, we have to avoid any waste, and we know that in some sectors there has been waste. Julianna Goldman [Bloomberg News]. You get the last word.", "label": "Implicit"}

What did you say exactly? And are you concerned that the dollar is too strong? [SEP] First of all, don't believe unnamed quotes. I did not say that. And I make a practice of not commenting on the daily fluctuations of the dollar or any other currency.With respect to Greece, I think that not only our G-7 partners but the IMF and other institutions that were represented here feel a sense of urgency in finding a path to resolve the situation there. And what it's going to require is Greece being serious about making some important reforms not only to satisfy creditors, but more importantly, to create a platform whereby the Greek economy can start growing again and prosper. And so the Greeks are going to have to follow through and make some tough political choices that will be good for the long term.I also think it's going to be important for the international community and the international financial agencies to recognize the extraordinary challenges that Greeks face. And if both sides are showing a sufficient flexibility, then I think we can get this problem resolved.

{"sentence": "Q. Hi, I'm from Beninese television. Mr. President, during this first visit to Benin— this is a first for you, but cooperation between our two countries is been going on for 47 years, but yet it's the first time that we host a President of your great country in our country. So in history, this has been written, but given what has just occurred, is this a diplomatic coup or is it truly a change in the relationships between the— Benin and the United States? Is this a stunt? [SEP] Well, I can give you my perspective, and of course, the President will give you his. First of all, I am the first President to have come to Benin. I am here to really confirm to the people of Benin and the people on the continent of Africa that the United States is committed to helping improve people's lives.And I also have come to a country like Benin to remind our fellow citizens that it's in our national interest to support the people of nations, even though we may not have had relations with them in the past, particularly those nations in which the leadership and the government makes a firm commitment to the investment in its people as well as fighting corruption and marketplace economies. And I'm—my trip here is a way to remind future Presidents and future Congresses that it is in the national interest and in the moral interest of the United States of America to help people.I reject some of the old-style type of grants, which basically said, let's feel better; we'll just give some money out. We believe that rather than making ourselves feel better, that our money ought to make the people of a particular country feel better about their government. And that's why the Millennium Challenge Account, for example, has got certain criterion. And your Government has met those criterion.And I would say that it's been a change of relationship. But it's been a change of relationship because the leader have changed attitude toward how government ought to relate to its people. And so, Mr. President, I'm proud to be the first President to be in Benin, and I want to thank you for extending me that invitation. I believe that perhaps for the journalists who are coming from abroad or my compatriots who are also journalists, I think that you know well my position on this issue. And I must tell you that the visit of the President is a symbol. Perhaps it's a signal to us, because as he just said, he conveys who at least—he is attached to virtue. Virtue means a lot to him. He is here to support the countries which strive to be virtuous, the governments which accept to be working on behalf of their people, to serve their people, especially as part of a clear vision where we say, where are we going? Where are we leading our people?And we were clear about that today. We want to move towards prosperity and sharing—prosperity, sharing, that means using the resources, the work, economic activity, and so on. Of course, this vision cannot be achieved unless you have the behaviors that—which you have defined, namely to ensure that everything that which stains our democracy, which is the—[inaudible]—of the people. Everything that would stains democracy will be suppressed—I should say, eliminated—which is why we want to ensure that our democracy will honor us, ensure education, access to water, to roads, to electricity, telephone, to infrastructure— all of these things without which you cannot create jobs and distribute income.And we identified these ailments that harm democracy, first and foremost, corruption, Mr. President. And behalf of the Beninese people, I would like to reassure you once again—I've did it already last month when I was visiting the United States at the White House—I told you that the people have already defined a mission. The mission that we have defined for ourselves is to guarantee that we can ensure good governance, have the best management of the affairs of a state. And it's at this price that we'll be able to accelerate this march towards prosperity.So, quite naturally for us, the visit of President Bush is a strong signal, which comforts us in our beliefs. It's an extra support, an extra encouragement in this direction to ensure that this vision will realize itself as quickly as possible for the wellbeing of our people. And in this regard, during the talks that we have just had, the President himself encouraged us by saying, go ahead, move forward. Do not hesitate. Don't distance yourself from the people. We Americans have to support you, but the issue, the initiatives that we've started in this—in the United States, namely the support against malaria, of course, the fight against HIV/AIDS, the emergency plan against HIV/AIDS, the MCA—because all of these initiatives today which reinforce U.S.—the United States position to help the poor and to fight against poverty.So I do believe this is a good starting point which takes into account the needs of the 21st century.

And secondly, what would you say to your critics that say by creating this scene here at NATO you're only enabling President Putin in Russia to further disturb things in Ukraine and Georgia—[inaudible]?

I think that NATO is much stronger now than it was 2 days ago. I think that NATO was not doing what they were supposed to be doing, a lot of the countries. And we were doing much more than we should have been doing.Frankly, we were carrying too much of a burden. That's why we call it burden-sharing. I was using the term a lot today, burden-sharing. We had a fantastic meeting at the end—29 countries. And they are putting up a lot. Germany has increased very substantially their time period, and Germany is coming along. And we still have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline, because the pipeline is coming in from Russia.So we're going to have to figure that out.

G-8 tends to be a more informal setting in which we talk about a wide range of issues in a pretty intimate way. And the thinking was that people would enjoy being in a more casual backdrop. I think the weather should be good that time of year. It will give me a chance to spend time with Mr. Putin, the new Russian President. And from there, we will then fly to Chicago.I always have confidence in Chicago being able to handle security issues. Whether it's Taste of Chicago or Lollapalooza--[]--or Bulls championships, we know how to deal with a crowd.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given how the Brexit vote shook the stability of the global economy, do you feel that you need to do more to calm the markets quickly and perhaps encourage a quick exit, rather than something that's long and drawn out? Do you still feel that the U.K. should be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States? And are you going to make a full-throated pitch for the TPP, for your prescription, when you're out on the campaign trail this summer, stumping for Secretary Clinton?And, Prime Minister Trudeau, both—I mean, you seem to be quite careful when you talk about Mr. Trump. Renegotiating NAFTA or tearing it up would be such a disaster for Canada. Why not come out and say that forcefully?And, President Peña Nieto, in March you compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. I'm wondering if you still stand by that. And how worried are you that this time next year there will be a wall up on your border? [SEP] Okay. [] Excellent questions, Roberta. She doesn't sound Canadian. [] That was pretty mean. [] Canadians are a little more subtle. []I'm actually going to help out my friends a little bit on your last question, even though it wasn't directed at me, and just say, when I visit other countries, it's not my job to comment on candidates in the middle of a race, just because they may end up winning. And the relationship between governments tend to transcend whoever is in power at any given time. So it's a tough question. It's—I'm not saying they shouldn't answer it, I'm just—I'm helping them out a little bit. [] Because there's no doubt that when I visit countries, there are times where I've got preferences, but I'd rarely express them.With respect to Brexit, first of all, I think you've seen the markets settle down a little bit over the last couple of days. I didn't follow the markets today. But we're monitoring very carefully whether there's any systemic strains on the system. And so far, what you've seen is reactions in the market, stock prices, currencies. But I think the preparations that were done by central banks and Finance Ministers, our Treasury Secretary, indicate the degree to which the global economy in the short run will hold steady. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.And so when we attend the G-20 summit in China later this year, one of the major topics—which is something that I've continually advocated for during the 7½ years that I've been President—is we all have to look at what we can do to boost global demand: whether it's the United States adopting a more robust budget for infrastructure improvements and fixing water systems in Flint, Michigan, or repairing airports that are not as efficient as they should be or rebuilding our power grid so that it can take advantage of clean energy; whether it's Germany, a country with a surplus, doing more in terms of spending, or Europe as a whole lifting some of the austerity constraints that have been placed on them; whether it's China shifting to a more consumer-based, domestic-based growth strategy as opposed to trying to export its way out of problems. There are going to be a whole host of measures that all of us can take to fortify the global economy, and that should be a top priority of ours.With respect to the actual Brexit negotiations, my main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand, and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. And I think that that will be a difficult, challenging process, but it does not need to be a panicky process. I think it can be a steady, sensible process.Obviously, leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to, but that—I think that's recognized, and that should happen fairly quickly. And I know that, speaking with Chancellor Merkel, that her interest is not in retribution, her interest is in making sure that the process works. And I have a lot of confidence in people being able to do that. And we will help in any way that we can to facilitate that.And then, the last part of your question is with respect to the U.K. and any trade agreement with the United States. Frankly, we will be the least of their problems right now, because their first order of business is going to be to address the market where they sell half their goods, which is Europe. And these things are not easily negotiated, particularly because we've been spending our time trying to negotiate with the European Union. And so to suddenly go off on another track will be challenging. But I think their first and primary concern is going to be to try to figure out how they interact with the European Union and the European market if in fact—and when in fact—they leave.I have emphasized throughout, though, that the special relationship that we have with Great Britain does not change; that the ties of affection and family and language and institutions and culture and the business relationships that exist, those are so deep and so long lasting—the cooperation we have on security issues and on global challenges, those are so fundamental—that our relationship with the U.K. fundamentally doesn't change.We are concerned that their absence from the European Union and the potential disruptions within Europe make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.[.] One of the things that's easy to forget amid the inflated rhetoric of an election campaign is that the relationship between our three countries goes far deeper than any individual leaders. And if the three of us get along, it's not just because we're aligned in many different values and priorities, it is very much because we serve citizens who are, they themselves, tremendously aligned in terms of priorities, in terms of hopes and dreams, in terms of desire for success and ways to reach it.So when you look at the level of integration, of our supply chains, of our markets, of the flow back and forward across borders of goods, of people, and the tremendous benefits that have come from proximity and strong relationships to individual citizens across this continent, it's essential that we understand that regardless of electoral rhetoric, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will continue to have tremendously close relationships economically, culturally, socially, familialy, historically, and towards the future.So as I've said many times, and I'll say again, I look forward to working with whomever the American people choose to elect as their President in November. I know that we will always be able to find shared priorities and challenges that we want to work together to overcome. And I know that our commitment to doing what's right and what's best for our citizens will lead us to much more alignment than differentiation. Roberta, I'll go straight to the point to describe the stand of my administration and my own very personal point of view. I've said it, and I'll say it again: My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. I don't think I've said anything different from what I'm stating once again here. What I have said is that today—and I did not make reference to a specific place—my words reinforce what I believe.I believe that in this global scenario—and I'll use President Obama's words, and as he said, he gave us a hand to address this question—we are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. What I have said is that, in the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.And I just said it: What we have reached so far—the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world—without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society—or the societies, at least, of our three countries—had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past—and President Obama already said it, even years back—but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind. And we saw it last century.That was my message when I made reference to this event. My message was about to value what we have and also to be aware of the road that we need to walk still. But that's the benefit that we're looking forward to: take the benefits to our societies.[ spoke in English as follows.] [Inaudible]—last question.[.]The question will be from Mr. Philippe-Vincent Foisy of Cogeco News.[.]", "label": "Implicit"}

The Mueller report came out: no obstruction, no collusion. No nothing. It's a beautiful report.The Democrats cannot understand what happened. They really thought they had some people on their side, because, as you know, the people doing the investigation were 18 extremely angry Democrats, many of whom worked for Hillary Clinton and supported Hillary Clinton.And Bob Mueller, I guess you could say, he wasn't a friend of mine, but he did something that was really the right thing to do. They were very disappointed. They can't get over the fact that—never spoke to Russia, never dealt with Russia, having to do with the subject we're talking about.And I will say this: That without question, we have done a job like few Presidents have done. The only thing you can say about me, that some people may not like, is that I've created one of the greatest economies anywhere in the world. In fact, when I first met with, yesterday—with Prime Minister Abe, the first thing he did was congratulate me on the incredible economy that we have in the United States. So I think that we will work with them. We have a USMCA. We have a deal with Canada and Mexico that everybody wants, I think. It's all done. And I think they probably want to be doing that.As you know, Ambassador Lighthizer is here, right now. That's a deal that's gotten universal praise. Unions love it. Farmers love it. Manufacturers love it. You won't have companies leaving and going to Mexico and going to Canada and going like they were for many, many years. It's a great deal. I would imagine that Nancy Pelosi will approve that. I would think it would be very hard not to, but we'll see.But certainly, as things get approved I would love to sign them.

And while we're talking about legacy items, if I could just ask another quick one on Guantanamo Bay. You have 4 months left, 60 prisoners left. At this point, are you willing to acknowledge that the prison will be open by the time you leave office? [SEP] Well, in terms of my reception here, as far as I can tell, it's been terrific. I don't know if you've gone and talked to some people in Laos. They seem pretty happy about my visit. Everywhere we've gone, we've had a great reception, just as earlier when we went to Vietnam we got a great reception. You'll recall, there were millions of people lining the streets.So if this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me going down the short stairs in China, yes, I think that is overblown. [] And I think that any reasonable person, certainly any person in the region, would be puzzled as to how this became somehow indicative of the work that we've done here.If you look at the remarks of leaders, if you look at the remarks of ordinary people, if you look at the concrete work that we've gotten done on everything from economic programs to development programs, to legacy of war issues, to promoting civil society and young people, the concern that I've heard is not that what we've done hasn't been important and successful. The concern that I've heard is, will it continue? And almost uniformly, the question I get from other leaders is, we hope that America's interest and presence and engagement is sustained.And my hope and expectation is, is that my successor will, in fact, sustain this kind of engagement, because there is a lot happening here. You've got countries here that are taking off. You've got one of the most dynamic and youngest populations in the world. This is where the action is going to be when it comes to commerce and trade and ultimately creating U.S. jobs by being able to sell to this market.And that's the only feedback that I've received. And that's not just based on what leaders tell me. If you read local newspapers or you talk to people, that's been the same commentary that we receive generally.With respect to Guantanamo, I am not ready to concede that it may still remain open, because we're still working diligently to continue to shrink the population. I continue to believe that Guantanamo is a recruitment tool for terrorist organizations, that it's—clouds and sours some of the counterterrorism cooperation that we need to engage in. And it's not necessary, and it's hugely expensive for U.S. taxpayers.Is there strong resistance in Congress? Absolutely. But as we continue to shrink the population to the point where we're looking at 40 or 50 people and are maintaining a multimillion-dollar operation to house these handfuls of individuals, I think the American people should be asking the question, why are we spending this kind of money that could be spent on other things when it's not necessary for our safety and security?So there's no doubt that because of the politics in Congress right now, it is a tough road to hoe.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, critics argue that your Medicare reform proposal lacks transparency and accountability. How do you respond to these concerns, and what steps are you taking to ensure that the process is open and accessible to the public? [SEP] Well, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It—called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates—what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors.

What I am suggesting, though, there is a functioning government. Your statement was, security didn't provide room for a government to stand up and function. Well, it's happening. And so therefore we will continue to press them on de-Ba'ath law, Provincial election laws, power sharing with the central government and the provinces, and oil law.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, Germany is advocating for a renewed Middle East Quartet. Given the perceived limited influence of European powers on the US, could you share an instance where a European leader persuaded you to alter your position on a significant policy matter? [SEP] Well, I wouldn't call it a change of mind, but my European friends have taught me that the United Nations is an important body in order to be able to convince parliaments of hard work that needs to be done. For example, getting resolutions on at the United Nations is important for a country like Denmark or Holland, in order for them to go to their parliaments and say, We have U.N. approval. As you probably are aware, I've really never felt like the United States needs to get United Nations approval to make decisions necessary for our security. But I have come to realize that other countries do rely upon the United Nations, and I respect that a lot. So there's an area, for example, where I have been taught a lesson by my allies and friends. I listen to Angela Merkel a lot. She has got a lot of wisdom. I don't know if this helps her or hurts her for me to say this, but nevertheless, my consultations with Angela are very productive and very important. The United States needs to have good relations with Europe in order for us to achieve big objectives, whether it be trade or peace or security, it's—the relations between Europe and the United States are vital. And sometimes the relations are—can be difficult. Not every country agrees, throughout Europe. And yet Angela always gives me good advice as to how to deal with the common problems we face in order to make sure that our alliance works for the common good. And I appreciate that very much. I simply think that we ought to try time and again to achieve some sort of results in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Looking at another field, for example, the adoption of the resolution on Iran, after all, we were able, looking at the past months, to forge a uniform position of the international community and have that reflected in a resolution of the United Nations Security Council. I think that's an enormous success, although things went obviously more slowly than if the EU and the United States, for example, had negotiated together. But by including Russia and China time and again in these negotiations, what evolved out of that process is an international community that is credibly being able to show Iran where there is a redline. And I think it's essential to see that the European Union, the United States, China, and Russia need to pull in the same direction on a number of other international issues. And I think it's very important that that goes for the Quartet, for example, too, because that's where I think that we will be able to make—it's an ideal forum where we can actually be able to make a difference and in a coherent fashion. If that Quartet were to be more active, therefore, in the future, the Presidency and also the Commission would obviously also have to meet a very specific task in fulfilling that—its part of the mandate. We need to make it clear, particularly to the not so constructive parts of Hamas, that they cannot play us off each other—us, that is the EU and the United States—but that we pull in the same direction, that we move in concert. And I must say I am a strong believer in this multilateral effort in these international fora, because it shows clearly where the redline is to those who do not wish for democracy. And this is what we need to do, time and again make it clear to them where the limits are, where the redlines are. No back rubs. []", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

As for my trip, my focus remains on working with both Israelis and President Abbas to find common ground and empower the Palestinians. We're exploring some promising initiatives. I'm still hopeful for an agreement by the end of my term, but ultimately, Hamas needs to demonstrate a commitment to peace. When Israel faces rocket attacks, they're going to defend themselves.

And if the larger tensions with Pakistan can't be resolved, does that put the NATO coalition's gains in Afghanistan at risk? [SEP] Well, keep in mind my discussion with President Zardari was very brief, as we were walking into the summit, and I emphasized to him what we have emphasized publicly as well as privately. We think that has to be part of the solution in Afghanistan; that it is in our national interest to see a that is democratic, that is prosperous, and that is stable; that we share a common enemy in the extremists that are found not only in Afghanistan, but also within ; and that we need to work through some of the tensions that have inevitably arisen after 10 years of our military presence in that region. President Zardari shared with me his belief that these issues can get worked through. We didn't anticipate that the supply line issue was going to be resolved by this summit. We knew that before we arrived in Chicago, but we're actually making diligent progress on it.And I think ultimately everybody in the alliance, all of ISAF, and most importantly, the people of Afghanistan and understand that neither country is going to have the kind of security, stability, and prosperity that it needs unless they can resolve some of these outstanding issues and join in common purpose with the international community in making sure that these regions are not harboring extremists. So I don't want to paper over real challenges there. There is no doubt that there have been tensions between ISAF and , the United States and over the last several months.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. One of the most significant events of this year was the revelation of the surveillance by the National Security Agency. As you review how to rein in the National Security Agency, a Federal judge said that, for example, the Government had failed to cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata actually stopped an imminent attack. Are you able to identify any specific examples when it did so? Are you convinced that the collection of that data is useful to national security and should continue as it is? [SEP] Let me talk more broadly, and then I'll talk specifically about the program you are referring to.As you know, the independent panel that I put together came back with a series of recommendations, 46 in total. I had an extensive meeting with them down in the Situation Room to review all the recommendations that they had made. I want to thank them publicly, because I think they did an excellent job and took my charge very seriously, which is, I told them, I want you to look from top to bottom at what we're doing and evaluate whether or not the current structures that we have and the current programs that we have are properly addressing both our continuing need to keep ourselves secure and to prevent terrorist attacks or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or other threats to the homeland? And are we also making sure that we're taking seriously rule of law and our concerns about privacy and civil liberties?So what we're doing now is evaluating all the recommendations that have been made. Over the next several weeks, I'm going to assess based on conversations not just with the intelligence community, but others in Government and outside of Government, how we might apply and incorporate their recommendations. And I'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about all of this in January, where I'll be able to say: here are the recommendations that we think make sense; here are ones that we think are promising, but still need to be refined further; here's how it relates to the work we're doing not just internally, but also in partnership with other countries. And so I'm taking this very seriously because I think, as I've said before, this is a debate that needed to be had.One specific program, the 215 program, is the metadata, the bulk collection of phone numbers and exchanges that have taken place, that has probably gotten the most attention, at least with respect to domestic audiences. And what I've said in the past continues to be the case, which is that the NSA, in executing this program, believed, based on experiences from 9/11, that it was important for us to be able to track if there was a phone number of a known terrorist outside of the United States calling into the United States, where that call might have gone, and that having that data in one place and retained for a certain period of time allowed them to be confident in pursuing various investigations of terrorist threats.And I think it's important to note that in all the reviews of this program that have been done, in fact, there have not been actual instances where it's been alleged that the NSA in some ways acted inappropriately in the use of this data. But what is also clear is, from the public debate, people are concerned about the prospect, the possibility, of abuse. And I think that's what the judge and the district court suggested. And although his opinion obviously differs from rulings on the FISA Court, we're taking those into account.The question we're going to have to ask is, can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing? I have confidence in the fact that the NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but I also recognize that as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers, that we may have to refine this further to give people more confidence. And I'm going to be working very hard on doing that.And we've got to provide more confidence to the international community. In some ways, what has been more challenging is the fact that we do have a lot of laws and checks and balances and safeguards and audits when it comes to making sure that the NSA and other intelligence agencies are not spying on Americans. We've had less legal constraint in terms of what we're doing internationally. But I think part of what's been interesting about this whole exercise is recognizing that in a virtual world, some of these boundaries don't matter anymore, and just because we can do something doesn't mean we necessarily should. And the values that we've got as Americans are ones that we have to be willing to apply beyond our borders, I think, perhaps more systematically than we've done in the past.Okay?

[SEP] Look, it's pretty straightforward. We're not going to fix Syria unless the Russians, Iranians, Turks, and our Gulf partners all buy in. It's a total mess with too many groups, too much cash, and too many guns pouring in. It's caught up in sectarian fights and geopolitical games. To sort it out, the big players who care about Syria need to agree that nobody's winning this on the battlefield. Iran's one of those players, and they need to be in the room.

Furthermore, do you anticipate that the other signatories to the original agreement will support this new direction? [SEP] Well, let me clarify. When I spoke of 'no Plan B,' I was alluding to the absence of a second Earth, a comment on climate change, not Iran. As for Iran, my position has remained consistent. Recall my UN address; I've always advocated for supplementing the JCPOA with pillars addressing post-2025 concerns, ballistic missile issues, and regional influence. The future of the JCPOA is, frankly, up in the air, and that's his call. I see the JCPOA as a foundational element, not the entirety of the solution. I'm not proposing a replacement, but an augmentation. I wouldn't be as critical of the JCPOA as he is, because I think we can usefully add to it. Regardless of the ultimate decision, my aim is to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement encompassing the JCPOA's existing provisions, extended nuclear restrictions, ballistic missile controls, and regional influence mitigation. We've had productive discussions on regional dynamics, particularly in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, recognizing the interconnectedness of nuclear and ballistic issues, and Iran's presence in the region. Our shared objective is to foster regional stability. This convergence of views paves the way for a new agreement addressing the Syrian conflict. I hope to work with our partners, and our foreign ministers are actively engaging in this small group. We will also have discussions with Russia and Turkey on regional topics, including Syria. I believe we can reconcile our common ground and differences. Tearing up the JCPOA without a replacement would be a mistake. Instead, we should build upon it to address all concerns. This approach acknowledges the criticisms of the JCPOA, which, let's not forget, was supported by previous American administrations. It also respects the sovereignty of regional states, focusing on building a stable framework for peace. It's not about tearing about an agreement and have nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns. And if I might add, they—states and, as I alluded to—that—and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost. The United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before—and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to—$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, Oh, we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things—tunnels, bridges—they say, Oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period. The countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important—because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that. But there is a chance—and nobody knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea—but we'll see. But we'll see also, if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations. Because this a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal. It's a bad structure. It's falling down. Should have never, ever been made. I blame Congress. I blame a lot of people for it. But it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th. But I will say, if Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid. Okay?

{"sentence": "President Obama, given the apparent stalling of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress, and the fact that other nations are waiting on the U.S., are you considering a shift in strategy to secure its approval, particularly in light of the Boeing and GE deals announced during your Vietnam trip? Furthermore, should the agreement be amended to tackle currency manipulation? And could you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur, as well as Pakistan's concerns about the strike occurring on their soil? Does this indicate a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you worried about a more extremist leader taking his place? [SEP] Look, on TPP, I've been around the block enough to know that every trade deal is a tough sell. Everyone wants a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. It's going to be scrutinized, debated, and in an election year, some folks will try to score political points. That being said, I'm still confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do for America and the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for us. Most countries here already sell to the U.S. with low tariffs, while our goods face higher tariffs there. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in those markets – a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for opening our markets to countries with lower wages and lax labor and environmental standards. TPP addresses this by including enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and protect the environment. As for currency manipulation, we have provisions for transparency and monitoring. Some argue for enforceable provisions to impose tariffs if currency is devalued, but it's hard to determine the cause of currency devaluation. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. However, we've strengthened provisions to address competitive devaluations. Finally, regarding Mullah Mansur, his death is confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This isn't a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself. However, when a high-profile leader consistently plans to harm U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, I have a responsibility to protect our people.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, despite your emphasis on European leaders funding their own bailout, your administration's stimulus measures are stalled in Congress. How can you credibly advise Europe on economic recovery when your own policies are facing such resistance at home? [SEP] Well, first of all, our conversations with European leaders weren't solely focused on stimulus measures. We discussed a range of strategies to promote economic growth, including rebalancing global demand. This involves adjustments and changes in behavior by various countries, not just government spending. There wasn't a disagreement with the Europeans. We all agree that it's crucial to demonstrate the strength and viability of the European project and the commitment to the euro. European leaders understand that this starts with a unified approach. We believe the elements for addressing the crisis are in place: a solution for Greece, recapitalization of European banks, and a firewall to protect the euro. We offered ideas and options for structuring the firewall. The international community stands ready to assist, but ultimately, Europe must show the markets that they are committed to the euro.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, you're going to California today. And as you said earlier this week, you told the Nation that there's no specific or credible threat of a similar attack. But how is it really possible to know? I mean, aren't similar plots going to be just as hard to detect beforehand? And some lawmakers are saying that your Government should review the social media of all people applying for visas to come to this country. What do you think of that idea? Should that be mandatory? [SEP] Well, Roberta, you're absolutely right that it is very difficult for us to detect lone-wolf plotsor plots involving a husband and wife, in this casebecause despite the incredible vigilance thatand professionalism of all our law enforcement, homeland security, et cetera, it's not that different from us trying to detect the next mass shooter. You don't always see it. They're not always communicating publicly, and if you're not catching what they say publicly, then it becomes a challenge.We are continuing to work at every level to make sure that there's no slip between information sharing among agencies. We're continuing to strengthen our information sharing with foreign countries. And because, in part, of the tragedy in Paris, I think you're seeing much greater cooperation from our European partners on these issues.But this is a different kind of challenge than the sort that we had with an organization like Al aida that involved highly trained operatives who are working as cells or as a network. Here, essentially, you have ISIL trying to encourage or induce somebody who may be prey to this kind of propaganda. And it becomes more difficult to see. It does mean that they're less likely to be able to carry out large, complex attacks. But as we saw in San Bernardino, obviously, you can still do enormous damage.The issue of reviewing social media for those who are obtaining visas, I think, may have gotten garbled a little bit, because there may beit's important to distinguish between posts that are publicsocial media on a Facebook pageversus private communications through various social media or apps. And our law enforcement and intelligence professionals are constantly monitoring public posts, and that is part of the visa review process, that people are investigating what individuals have said publicly and questioned about any statements that they maybe made.But if you have a private communications between two individuals, that's harder to discern, by definition. And one of the things we'll be doing is engaging with the high-tech community to find out how we can, in an appropriate way, do a better job, if we have a lead, to be able to track a suspected terrorist. But we're going to have to recognize that no government is going to have the capacity to read every single person's text or e-mails or social media. If it's not posted publicly, then there are going to be feasibility issues that are probably insurmountable at some level, and it raises questions about our values.I mean, keep in mind it was only a couple of years ago where we were having a major debate about whether the Government was becoming too much like Big Brother. And overall, I think we've struck the right balance in protecting civil liberties and making sure that U.S. citizens' privacy is preserved, that we are making sure that there's oversight to what our intelligence agencies do. But we're going to have to continue to balance our needs for security with people's legitimate concerns about privacy.And because the Internet is global and communication systems are global, the values that we apply here oftentimes are ones that folks who are trying to come into the country are also benefiting from because they're using the same technologies. But this is precisely why we're working very hard to bring law enforcement, intelligence, and high-tech companies together. Because we're going to have to really review what we can do both technically as well as consistent with our laws and our values in order to try to discern more rapidly some of the potential threats that may be out there.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've described the U.S. relationship with China as complex. U.S. military sources are now confirming that Chinese hackers hacked into the computers at the Pentagon in June, hackers linked to the Government in Beijing. And it's being described as a complicated cyber attack. Have you been briefed on this attack? How much more complex does this make the relationship with China? And do you plan to bring it up with President Hu Jintao on Thursday? [SEP] I'm very aware that a lot of our systems are vulnerable to cyber attack from a variety of places. And therefore, the first question should be—not to put questions in your mouth, Bret, but— what are you doing to defend America against cyber attack? Are you aware that we have vulnerabilities, that people can hack into sensitive systems? And are you then providing expertise and technology necessary to defend? And the answer is, yes. We understand that we're vulnerable in some systems, some, by the way, more valuable than others—or less valuable than others, I guess, is the best way to put it.In terms of whether or not I'll bring this up to countries that we suspect may— from which there may have been an attack, I may. In this instance, I don't have the intelligence at my fingertips right now. Whether it be this issue or issues like intellectual property rights, I mean, if you have a relationship with a country, then you've got to respect the country's systems and knowledge base. And that's what we expect from people with whom we trade.Our relationship with China is complex. On the one hand, we appreciate the opportunity to trade goods and services. We certainly hope that China changes from a saving society to a consuming society. Right now, because of the lack of a safety net, many Chinese save for what we call a rainy day. What we want is the Government to provide more of a safety net so they start buying more and Australian products. We want there to be a—the middle class to feel comfortable coming into the marketplace, the global marketplace, so that our producers can see the benefits directly with trade with China.By the way, our exports to China are up, Mr. Prime Minister, which is positive. We still have got a huge trade deficit with China, which then causes us to want to work with them to adjust—to let their currency float. We think that would be helpful in terms of adjusting trade balances.We've got great relations with China from a diplomatic perspective. In other words, we're able to talk with them openly and candidly. But do we agree on every issue? Not at all. I mean, for example, I've spent time talking about dissidents who have been jailed. I'm concerned about the treatment of the Dalai Lama. I want China to be more aggressive when it comes to Iran. I'm interested to hear President Hu Jintao's attitudes toward the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. In other words, there's a lot of issues which we wish they would have a different lean to their policy, so I'm going to discuss these with him. But it's best to be able to discuss these issues in an environment that is frank and open and friendly, as opposed to one in which there's tension and suspicion.And so when I say we've got great relations, I will sit down with the President and have a good, honest, candid discussion. And he's going to tell me what's on his mind, and I'm darned sure going to tell him what's on my mind.One area where we are making good progress is on North Korea. As you may remember, I shifted the whole strategic approach to North Korea. I'm convinced that it's more effective to have five countries to say to North Korea the same thing than just one country, so that if North Korea makes the decision not to honor their word, that there's a better chance that there's consequences that they'll feel. And so as a result of getting China to the table on North Korea, the North Koreans are going to realize there is a lot more than one voice. And China has been instrumental in helping move this process forward. Chris Hill—Ambassador Hill briefed me and Secretary Rice this morning on the fact that North Korea still looks like they're going to honor their agreement to disclose and to shut down their nuclear programs, which will be good for peace.Anyway, a long answer because it's a complex relationship.

In other words, people who work for industries that export goods to overseas are likely to be paid more than their—other workers.Secondly, if you look at the—our economic growth recently, particularly last year, a major portion of that growth came as a result of exports. It's an essential part of our economic picture.Yes, I heard the talk about NAFTA. One statistic I think people need to know is, I think there's roughly, like, $380 billion worth of goods that we ship to our NAFTA partners on an annual basis. Now, $380 billion worth of goods means there's a lot of farmers and businesses, large and small, who are benefiting from having a market in our neighborhood. And the idea of just unilaterally withdrawing from a trade treaty because of trying to score political points is not good policy. It's not good policy on the merits, and it's not good policy to— as a message to send to our—people who have, in good faith, signed a treaty and worked with us on a treaty.Thirdly, those of us who grew up in Texas remember what the border looked like when we were kids, and it was really poor. And you go down to that border today, it is prosperous on both sides of the river, to the credit of those who proposed NAFTA and to the credit of those who got NAFTA through the Congress. If you're worried about people coming into our country illegally, it makes sense to help a place like Mexico grow its economy. Most folks would rather be finding a job close to home; most folks would rather not try to get in the bottom of an 18-wheeler to come and put food on the table.This agreement has meant prosperity on both sides of our borders, north and south. And I believe it's in the interests to continue to seek markets for our farmers, ranchers, and businesspeople. I also know it's in our interest to insist that when people sell products into our countries, that we get treated fairly. In other words, if we treat a country one way—people in a country one way—we expect to be treated the same way, like Colombia.The Colombia free trade vote's coming up. Many of their products come into our country much easier than our products go into theirs. It makes sense to be treated equally. But on this vote, there's an additional consequence. If the Congress rejects the Colombia free trade agreement, it will sorely affect the national security interests of the United States. It will encourage false populism in our neighborhood. It will undermine the standing of courageous leaders like President Uribe. And I strongly urge the Congress, when they bring this—when the Colombia free trade agreement is brought to a vote, to seriously consider the consequences of rejecting this trade agreement.Mike [Mike Emanuel, FOX News].", "label": "General"}

We're doubling the Border Patrol, building fences, and using new technology. I even sent the National Guard down there for a while. This bill addresses those concerns. It sets benchmarks for border security before any other reforms take place. But you can't have real border security without a temporary worker program. People will come here to work, and they'll find a way. That creates an underground industry of smugglers and document forgers. It's inhumane. We need to give people a legal way to come here and work temporarily. And we need a tamper-proof ID card to verify employment. The most difficult part is what to do with the people already here. Some people want to deport them all, but that's not realistic. And we can't just give them automatic citizenship.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, on Cuba, the Cuban government often claims U.S. interference justifies their restrictions on freedoms. Does your new policy truly end U.S. regime change efforts, and should Cuba then respond with free elections and tolerance of dissent? Also, Vice President Biden says the Democratic race is wide open, despite what polls suggest. What's your opinion? [SEP] I'm not running any more elections, and I'm not in the business of predicting them. That's your job. Plenty of people are happy to give their opinions, but I won't be one of them. On Cuba, we're not focused on regime change. We're focused on ensuring the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to shape their own destiny and lives, and on supporting civil society. There will be an evolution in Cuba, regardless of what we do. Partly, it's generational. President Castro's comments earlier referenced actions that took place before I was born, and part of my message is that the Cold War is over. We still face many challenges and issues around the world, and we will still have serious issues with Cuba regarding its government's approach to its own people, as well as regional concerns. There may be areas where we can cooperate. Cuban doctors made a difference during the Ebola crisis, and Cuban activity in Haiti after the earthquake was significant. I told President Castro what I've told leaders throughout the region: we have a point of view, and we won't hesitate to express it. But I believe the best way to promote the values we care about is through persuasion. That will be our primary approach on these issues, mainly because they don't directly threaten our national security. Cuba is not a threat to the United States, although we have differences. Among the threats I'm concerned about, I would list ISIL, Iran's nuclear ambitions, activities in Yemen and Libya, Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and climate change. Our approach must be to work with the region and other countries, clearly stating what we believe in and what works. Often, when we intervene in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive and backfires. That's been part of our history, which is why countries use us as an excuse for their own governance failures. Let's remove that excuse and be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everyone to promote opportunity, prosperity, and security in the region.", "label": "Declining to answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. How hard is it for you to conduct the war without popular support? For you personally, do you ever have trouble balancing the—between doing what you think is the right thing and following the will of the majority of the public, which is really the essence of democracy? [SEP] Yes, it is. And, first of all, I can fully understand why people are tired of the war. The question they have is, can we win it? And of course I'm concerned about whether or not the American people are in this fight. I believe, however, that when they really think about the consequences if we were to precipitously withdraw, they begin to say to themselves, maybe we ought to win this; maybe we ought to have a stable Iraq.Their question, it seems like to me, is, can we succeed? And that's a very important, legitimate question for anybody to ask. I think many people understand we must succeed, and I think a lot of people understand we've got to wait for the generals to make these military decisions. I suspect—I know this, Ed, that if our troops thought that I was taking a poll to decide how to conduct this war, they would be very concerned about the mission. In other words, if our troops said, Well, here we are in combat, and we've got a Commander in Chief who is running a focus group. In other words, politics would be—is more important to him than our safety and/or our strategy, that would dispirit our troops.And there's a lot of constituencies in this fight. Clearly the American people, who are paying for this, is the major constituency. And I repeat to you, Ed, I understand that there—this violence has affected them. And a lot of people don't think we can win. There's a lot of people in Congress who don't think we can win as well, and therefore, their attitude is, get out.My concern with that strategy—something that Mike Hayden also discussed— is that just getting out may sound simple, and it may affect polls, but it would have long-term, serious security consequences for the United States. And so, Ed, sometimes you just have to make the decisions based upon what you think is right. My most important job is to help secure this country, and therefore, the decisions in Iraq are all aimed at helping do that job. And that's what I firmly believe.A second constituency is the military. And I repeat to you: I'm pretty confident our military do not want their Commander in Chief making political decisions about their future.A third constituency that matters to me a lot is the military families. These are good folks who are making huge sacrifices, and they support their loved ones. And I don't think they want their Commander in Chief making decisions based upon popularity.Another constituency group that is important for me to talk to is the Iraqis. Obviously, I want the Iraqi Government to understand that we expect there to be reconciliation top down, that we want to see laws passed. I think they've got that message. They know full well that the American Government and the American people expect to see tangible evidence of working together. That's what the benchmarks are aimed to do.But they also need to know that I am making decisions based upon our security interests, of course, but also helping them succeed, and that a poll is not going to determine the course of action by the United States. What will determine the course of actions is, will the decisions that we have made help secure our country for the long run?And finally, another constituency is the enemy, who are wondering whether or not America has got the resolve and the determination to stay after them. And so that's what I think about, Ed.And, you know, I guess I'm like any other political figure; everybody wants to be loved, just sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don't enable you to be loved. And so when it's all said and done, Ed, when you've—if you ever come down and visit the old, tired me down there in Crawford, I will be able to say, I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle, not based upon politics. And that's important to me.Thank you all for your time. I loved being here at this new building. Thank you.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. After your election 2 years ago, when you met with Republicans you said that, in discussing what policies might go forward, that elections have consequences and that you pointed out that you had won. I wonder what consequences you think this election should have then, in terms of your policies. Are there areas that you're willing--can you name today areas that you would be willing to compromise on that you might not have been willing to compromise on in the past? [SEP] Well, I think I've been willing to compromise in the past and I'm going to be willing to compromise going forward on a whole range of issues. Let me give you an example, the issue of energy that I just mentioned.I think there are a lot of Republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the House last year. And so it's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the House this year or next year or the year after. But that doesn't mean there isn't agreement that we should have a better energy policy. And so let's find those areas where we can agree.We've got, I think, broad agreement that we've got terrific natural gas resources in this country. Are we doing everything we can to develop those? There's a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric cars are developed here in the United States, that we don't fall behind other countries. Are there things that we can do to encourage that? And there's already been bipartisan interest on those issues.There's been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases. Is that an area where we can move forward?We were able, over the last 2 years, to increase, for the first time in 30 years, fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. We didn't even need legislation. We just needed the cooperation of automakers and autoworkers and investors and other shareholders. And that's going to move us forward in a serious way.So I think when it comes to something like energy, what we're probably going to have to do is say, here are some areas where there's just too much disagreement between Democrats and Republicans. We can't get this done right now, but let's not wait. Let's go ahead and start making some progress on the things that we do agree on, and we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those areas where we don't.", "label": "Dodging"}

It's a multi-faceted approach that includes structural reforms, responsible fiscal management, and strategic investments. A growing economy generates more revenue, which helps to alleviate debt. Cutting spending during an economic downturn is counterproductive. We have the advantage of the dollar being the world's reserve currency, providing us with unique flexibility.

{"sentence": "Q. And a subsidiary question, what do you think about taking it out of the political realm and giving it to an outside body of experts to take the politics out of Medicare? [SEP] Well, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It—called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates—what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors.

The key question is, are the Afghans getting better? Kabul, where a lot of Afghans live, has been mostly policed by Afghan forces for a while, and they've done a decent job. Kabul's safer now, and the Afghan forces are more capable. That doesn't mean these attacks won't happen, and they probably will for some time. We're not done yet. But as I've said, the war is winding down. We're in a transition phase. And like in Iraq, where we pulled out troops and will have the rest out by the end of the year, but Iraq's been able to keep a democratic government and reduce violence, we think a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan.

Don't take our system for granted. Democracy is hard work. If people don't vote, democracy weakens. If we can't tell truth from propaganda, we have problems.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you've often spoken about expanding rights and opportunities for all Americans. However, as you leave office, many worry that the progress made will be undone. Considering your past remarks about closing remaining gaps, what are the most pressing rights issues that still need addressing? How do you plan to contribute to resolving these issues in your post-presidency? And, as the first African American President, what are your thoughts on the likelihood of seeing another Black President in the near future? [SEP] Let me address that last question first. I firmly believe we will continue to see talented individuals from every conceivable background rise to positions of leadership in this country. That's the essence of America's strength – when everyone has a fair chance to succeed. I've often used the analogy of our Olympic teams. Their incredible diversity is a testament to our nation's potential. You see athletes of all shapes, sizes, and colors achieving greatness. This genetic diversity is a tremendous asset. Consider Simone Biles and Michael Phelps – vastly different individuals, yet both champions in their respective fields. And it's worth noting that women consistently win a significant portion of our medals, a direct result of Title IX, which has provided them with unparalleled opportunities in sports.So, if we remain committed to ensuring equal opportunity for all, I have no doubt that we will see a woman President, a Latino President, a Jewish President, a Hindu President – the possibilities are endless. Perhaps even a President of mixed heritage that defies easy categorization. That's perfectly acceptable.Regarding my concerns, I addressed many of these in my Farewell Address, so I won't reiterate them all here. However, inequality remains a significant challenge. If we fail to invest in ensuring that everyone can participate fully in the economy, we risk hindering economic growth and exacerbating divisions among Americans, not just along racial lines. Many individuals voted for the President-elect because they feel marginalized and forgotten, believing that their children will not have the same opportunities they once had.We must avoid a scenario where a small elite thrives while the majority struggles for scraps. This breeds resentment and can amplify racial tensions, as people begin to believe that the only way to advance is by taking something from someone who looks or worships differently. This is not a recipe for a healthy democracy.I am also deeply concerned about the fundamental mechanisms of our democracy.

Does this signal a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you concerned about a more hardline successor? [SEP] Well, on TPP, every trade deal is painful. Folks are always looking for a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. And in an election year, some will try to score political points. But I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do. It's good for America, the region, and the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for the U.S. Most countries here already sell to us with low tariffs, while our goods face higher tariffs. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods. Also, TPP commits countries to higher labor standards and environmental regulations. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will make us worse off. American workers and businesses are better off if we pass this deal. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too.

Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. But we've strengthened provisions to address competitive devaluations. Finally, Mullah Mansur is dead. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This doesn't represent a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country. But when a high-profile leader targets U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, I have a responsibility to protect our people.

The Senate voted overwhelmingly against it. We've adopted energy efficiency standards based on innovation. We reduced greenhouse gases while our economy expanded. We seek to lessen our reliance on foreign oil through the 20-in-10 initiative. New technologies are on the horizon, and Kyoto did not foster that. Many nations are not meeting Kyoto's targets. We rejected it to grow our economy, reduce oil dependence, and be environmentally responsible. I supported John's focus on climate change at APEC. I urged our G-8 partners to include nations like China and India. Otherwise, they may reject a solution imposed upon them.

Additionally, concerning Cuba, did you and President Castro discuss the 45-day waiting period for removing Cuba from the state sponsor of terrorism list, and do you foresee any remaining obstacles to opening embassies once that removal is approved? [SEP] Okay, let me address Iran one more time. We have a political framework established between Iran and the P-5-plus-1. Some aspects, such as centrifuge reductions at Natanz, are highly specific. Others are expressions of intent, but the specifics are crucial. The interpretation of these details will be subject to negotiation. It's inaccurate to suggest that everything is finalized. We have a framework that, if implemented effectively, will achieve our goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. However, the details matter significantly, and there will be challenging negotiations. That's what I've maintained from the beginning. Regarding Cuba, we didn't delve into the level of detail you mentioned. The state sponsor of terrorism recommendation is forthcoming. Congress will have an opportunity to review it. The Embassy concerns are likely primarily on the Cuban side. They haven't had an American Embassy in quite some time.

We're collaborating with China to find solutions, but it won't be a walk in the park. I don't believe there's cause for concern about a new Cold War.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up on your comments about NAFTA. The Democratic Presidential candidates, in fact, are talking about renegotiating that trade agreement if elected. I'm wondering if you're worried that their comments on the campaign trail are perhaps overshadowing your protrade agenda. In essence, do you worry that you're losing the free trade debate in the courts of public opinion?And to President Calderon and Prime Minister Harper, I'd like to get your thoughts about expanding your trade relationship with the United States. Is there a point at which you shift attention to the people running for the White House and their views and try to reach out to them? [SEP] Actually, my biggest concern on trade right now is with Colombia. NAFTA exists, and NAFTA—when you analyze it in an objective way, it benefits— beneficial to America. It also happens to be beneficial to Mexico and Canada, which makes it a, you know, a very good, comprehensive agreement.It's beneficial to us because when you're able to export to your neighborhood, it helps create jobs. Jobs are created when people find outlets for their goods and services. We have found a lot of outlets for our goods and services with our—in our neighborhood. It also helps consumers when you import. In other words, the more choices consumers have, the more options they have, the more—less likely it is there will be price increases, and it's better for your consumers. This agreement's been beneficial in creating wealth in our neighborhood. Our economies have all grown.I also happen to think it's very important for our citizens. I wish people could remember what the border looked like between Texas and Mexico before NAFTA. I mean, it was poor, really poor, on both sides of the border. If you go down there today, there's prosperity on both sides of the border, and that's in our Nation's interests.I mean, one way to increase pressure on the border is to—if you do it—away with NAFTA, there's going to be a lot of Mexicans—more Mexicans out of work. It will make it harder on the border. It will make it harder to deal with. So people who say, Let's get rid of NAFTA, because of a throwaway political line, must understand this has been good for America, and it's also been good for Mexico and Canada, and that's what you want in your neighborhood.Secondly, my biggest concern is to turn our back on our friends in Colombia. The Speaker of the House made a decision, using an extraordinary procedure, to prevent a vote on a trade bill that had been negotiated in good faith between our respective countries. You heard the—President Calderon say, it's in the region's interest to trade freely and fairly. Well, this agreement we have with Colombia right now is not fair for America, it's not fair for our businesses, it's not fair for our farmers. And all I'm asking the Congress is to make it fair.And if they—if the Speaker doesn't bring—give us a date certain on the bill, she's effectively killed it. It's her responsibility, and she's going to have to explain why the voices of false populism have been strengthened, why anti-Americanism could flourish, when America turns its back on a strong leader like President Uribe and a friend for democracy like President Uribe.I'm concerned about protectionism in America. It's not in our interests to become a protectionist nation. And so I'll continue to speak out on it and assure our friends that we will work hard to explain to the people the benefits of why free and fair trade is in our Nation's interest. First of all, what we have to do—all of us who have responsibilities vis-a-vis our citizens—is to objectively study the facts. What's happened with NAFTA in our three countries? Before NAFTA, there were many businesses, Mexican businesses, that were afraid, and they alleged that it was impossible to compete with the sophisticated and modern U.S. companies. And they weren't going to survive. There were also many U.S. companies who thought it was impossible to compete in more open markets. Now, what was the result? The result has been that trade has grown, and that has led to gains for everyone involved.Contrary to what they believe—that one was going to win, the other would lose— it was a win-win situation, and NAFTA has benefited the three countries. Trade has grown in all three, jobs have grown in all three, and even wage levels have gone up in all three. Today, the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are bigger and stronger than they were 14 years ago. Income per capita for all three has also grown compared to 14 years ago. The benefits are visible, and all you need to do is to talk based on demonstrated results.To talk about taking a step backwards, in terms of free trade in the case of Mexico, would effectively provoke considerable damage on the economy. And another factor I was discussing yesterday with President Bush—that he reiterated today, and I will reiterate as well—would be a sudden loss of economic opportunities that would even lead to even greater migratory pressure in the—against—with the United States.We are doing everything we can in order to create job opportunities in Mexico for people so that Mexicans will not need to seek job opportunities outside their country. And the only way to do it is by creating jobs in Mexico, and the only way is, precisely, multiplying our possibilities of trade.In the case of the U.S. economy, if you were to take a step backwards with regard to NAFTA or free trade, you would be condemning Americans to have one of the least competitive economies in the developed world. While other parts of the world are accelerating their growth, their integration—China, Japan, India, Asia—in order to have more competitive economies and more complementary situations—and Europe is already becoming a single trade group, and they're adding more and more countries to that bloc every year—here you see protectionist voices arising. And the only thing they would achieve, if they were to prosper, would be to condemn North America as a region to complete backwardness in today's world. And that is the worst possible solution you can provide to your citizens.It is not my role to talk to the three candidates or precandidates to the Presidency. I'm very respectful of the domestic politics of this country. This is a decision that is solely in the hands of U.S. citizens. And for that reason, I must respect that process completely. It is not my role to talk to any candidates or precandidates. All I would do is speak to the person who will eventually be the President of the United States. And we will speak openly and sincerely about the future of both of our countries or, in this case, our three countries in the trilateral meetings that we hold.But Mexico will have a respectful relationship with the next President of the United States and will always seek the prosperity of our nations, knowing that through free trade, we have a clear, open, and respectful relationship among all our countries that will achieve prosperity.If we want to solve common problems, if we want to solve problems like security, problems like immigration, problems like economic growth in the United States and in Mexico, we need to understand that only to the extent that North America is more competitive as a region, only to that extent will we be able to successfully face our problems. We have been working with the current U.S. administration. We've had a very productive relationship with President Bush and his administration. And I trust that this will continue, that it will continue with any of the Presidential candidates here in the United States.Of course, it's the United States who needs to make a decision about this election. But I think that in the end, Canada really is confident that the next President will also understand the importance of NAFTA and the importance of the commercial relationship between the United States and Canada. And I must emphasize that for energy security, the commercial relationship between our two countries is even more important today than it was 20 years ago. And I think this relationship will be even more important in the future.[]——productive relationship with the current administration, and I anticipate that Canada will have a very productive relationship with the next administration, because I'm confident that when the facts are looked at, any President, just as any Prime Minister of Canada, will quickly conclude how critically important NAFTA and our North American/Canadian-American trade relations are to jobs and prosperity on both sides of our border and, in particular, the importance of energy security that is a particularly critical part of the NAFTA arrangement.Canada is the biggest and most stable supplier of energy to the United States in the world. That energy security is more important now than it was 20 years ago, when NAFTA was negotiated, and will be even more important in the future.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. But you don't think the spending cuts themselves will cause a recession? [SEP] I know they won't. I know they won't.Matter of fact, the fact that we were able to cut Government spending by $1.7 trillion, that didn't cause a recession; that caused growth. Look, we have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We've created 12-point—I think it's—7 million new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have moved in a direction where we're rebuilding and reconstructing America through the infrastructure act.Look, here's the other thing. I'm sure—I'm not sure; my guess is, I'll get a question about, you know, Well, wait a minute, you know, the American people aren't satisfied. Well, guess what? As I've told you all before, most of this—what we've passed—doesn't kick in—it only kicks in over time. And so the fact is, for example, that if you're in a situation where you were—I'll give you the one example that I've used—everybody understands the easiest—is insulin.Well, I decided that we were going to be in a position where we were not going to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. And that's what we do, by the way. Same manufacturer of a drug in the United States, selling it here in Japan, selling it in Tokyo, or selling it in Berlin, or selling it around the world, they pay a lot less than we pay at home.So we said a simple proposition: Let's take a look at how much it costs to make the product. And I'm not going to ask you to—a show of hands like I do in a town meeting, but if—I usually ask, How many people know somebody who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes? And I'm almost—at least half the audience raises their hand.Well, they were paying somewhere between $4- and $700 a month for their insulin that they badly need to stay healthy and alive. Well, guess what? It costs $10—t-e-n—$10 to make. To package, total amount, you could argue maybe as much as $13.Well, guess what? Now they can't charge more for—Medicare can't, because Medicare is paying—taking American tax dollars and paying for the elderly's health care needs. You can't charge more than $35 for that drug. That saves $160 billion. Hear it? A hundred and sixty billion dollars less will be paid out by the Federal—by the American taxpayer to help the elderly people on Medicare with a problem.Well, a lot of this is just kicking in. We're in a situation where next year, for the drug costs, no senior will have to pay—total cost—total cost of all the drugs, from expensive cancer drugs to whatever drugs they're taking, will not have to pay more than $3,500 a year. The following year—we've already passed this. This is the law now. The following year, they won't have to pay more than $2,000. That saves another $200 billion that we're paying out.But the other team won't count this. Even though it's the law—we passed it—they won't count that as reducing the debt.So there's a lot of those kinds of disagreements we have. And my guess is that I'm going to be talking to the Speaker of the House on the way back on the plane, because it will be morning time over—at home. And I'm going to be in that plane in about an hour or so.

{"sentence": "Considering the Iranian elections, what specific adjustments, if any, will you make to your strategy for engaging with Iran? [SEP] I've always acknowledged Iran's rich heritage, but their actions have been detrimental to regional and global stability. Their support for terrorist organizations, their aggressive stance towards Israel, and their nuclear program are deeply concerning. We need a multifaceted approach, including diplomacy. My national security team is reassessing our current policy, looking for areas where we can engage constructively. We expect to find openings for direct dialogue in the near future, allowing us to redirect our policy. Progress will be slow, given the history of mistrust. We will be explicit about our concerns regarding terrorism funding and nuclear proliferation. We aspire to a relationship built on mutual respect, as shown by my approach to the Middle East and my appointment of George Mitchell.

Under what circumstances might you consider a plea agreement or amnesty? And what do you say to those Americans who believe Snowden was right to expose government surveillance? [SEP] I have to be careful here, because Snowden is facing criminal charges, and that's a matter for the courts. I can't really weigh in on the specifics. But I've said before that we needed to have a conversation about surveillance. At the same time, the way Snowden released that information hurt our country and our intelligence capabilities. There was a better way to do it. The US, for all its faults, respects the law and values privacy. Because of what Snowden did, countries that actually spy on their own people are now criticizing us.

{"sentence": "Q. You've been clear about saying that you will veto overspending by Congress when they come back next month to do appropriations bills. You've also been clear you don't want to raise taxes. Can you do justice to the kind of programs the Government needs for bridges, for housing, and also continue to spend as much as you do with the war in Iraq? [SEP] One can meet priorities if they set priorities. The problem in Congress is they have trouble actually focusing on priorities. Appropriators take their title seriously, and they all feel like they got to appropriate, which means there's a myriad of priorities. So the role of the President, it seems to me, is to help Congress focus on that which is important. We have a debate over that which is important, of course, but one thing that we shouldn't have a debate over is whether or not it's important to fund our troops in this war against radicals, extremists, the war on terror. And I think we'll be able to get that kind of cooperation. I would hope that they would get the defense bill to my desk as quickly as possible.Part of my concerns, of course, is that there are different sets of priorities in both bodies. And it seems like to me that the Congress needs to come together, solve their differences—solve their differences first, and then bring them to the White House and see if we can find accommodation. I have proven in the past, though, Ann, that one is able to set priorities— keep taxes low, grow the economy—and reduce the deficit. In other words, we have cut taxes, causing economic growth, which caused there to be this year alone 187 billion more tax dollars coming into the Treasury; the deficit is reduced to 1.5 percent of GDP, which on a 40-year historical average is very low, or is low, below the average; and we've proven that you can set priorities and meet obligations.

How do you respond to concerns that this delay exacerbated the situation and what specific assurances can you offer that the new measures will be more effective in managing the border? [SEP] Well, let me be clear. The situation at Roxham Road was complex, not something you could just snap your fingers and fix. Simply shutting it down would have been reckless, pushing people to more dangerous, uncontrolled areas. We needed a comprehensive solution, and that's what the modernized Safe Third Country Agreement provides. It ensures a consistent approach, directing asylum seekers to the appropriate channels. This wasn't a quick fix, it required careful negotiation and planning. But make no mistake, we are protecting the integrity of our system while upholding our obligations to those seeking asylum.

Australia has been particularly supportive. Huawei will not be operating here. We have informed certain countries considering utilizing Huawei that we will not be sharing intelligence with them.

The numbers are getting to a point where they can, and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue States to get back into gear. And the people aren't going to stand for it; they want to get back.They're not going to stand for it. They want our country opened. I want our country opened too. I want it opened safely, but I want it open.Don't forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route: Everything is closed up, you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that too.

And if unauthorized, do you suspect someone in your administration is trying to undermine your Iraq policy or sabotage your meeting with Prime Minister al-Maliki? [SEP] Mark, let me see if I recall ordering such an investigation. I don't specifically recall doing so. I do remember expressing concern about the ongoing leaks. You all work diligently to uncover information and disseminate it to the public, which I understand. However, I disapprove of those who leak classified documents. It's a persistent issue, not just for this administration but for any administration attempting to implement policy that affects the country's future. We've experienced numerous leaks, some originating from—well, I'm unsure of their source, so I won't speculate. It's often difficult to identify the leaker. It's an advantage you have in your profession. We can lament it, but it's challenging to find those within the government willing to provide, in this case, Hadley's document to newspapers. There may be an ongoing investigation; I'm simply not aware of it. If there is, and I knew about it, it's not at the forefront of my mind. However, I believe it would be beneficial to identify individuals within our government who are leaking materials, which is clearly against the law, and hold them accountable.

{"sentence": "Q. You've spoken throughout the trip about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. It's been a big subject here in Guatemala City. Can you provide a little more detail, sir, if you would, about how you intend to overcome congressional opposition? There is opposition in both parties, specifically at the moment. A bill has been expected for some time now. You've been working with Senators, and your staff have been working with Senators. Is there a holdup? How are you tackling the problem at the moment, sir? [SEP] Yes. No, I appreciate that. He's referring to the process at this point in time, about why hadn't a consensus bill in the Senate began to emerge. And it's because this is a complicated issue that requires both parties learning to work together on this issue. I believe it is, first of all, incumbent to find, as best as possible, a coherent Republican position in the Senate. And that's where we're spending a lot of time right now. And then, as I understand it, Senator Kennedy will be carrying the bill on the Democrat side, and then once we can get a coherent Republican position, one that most Republicans are comfortable with, then we'll start working with the Senator.As you know full well that if we don't have enough consensus, nothing is going to move out of the Senate. And if nothing moves out of the Senate, nothing is going to happen in the House. And so therefore, the initial stages of getting a bill that meets objections is time consuming, but it is worth it and necessary in order for us to be able to address the concerns, many of which were expressed during the last debate on immigration reform.Now, I'm optimistic, I really am. I believe we can get something done, and I believe we're beginning to find consensus. I think there is pretty widespread consensus that there ought to be a temporary-worker plan that says, you can come legally to the United States to do a job Americans are not doing, for a period of time. That will help a lot of the Guatemalan citizens. It will mean somebody, first of all, doesn't have to sneak in the country in the first place and pay a or buy forged documents or sleep in some sleazy place hiding from authorities until you're able to make destination. You'll be able to come in, in a rational way.Secondly, that once you're in the United States, if you have to come home to be with your family, you'll be able to do so in a legal way; in other words, you'll be able to come back and forth without fear. Now, you won't be able to—there will be a time limit on the amount of time, and that's part of the negotiations.The hard issue, as the President noted and I just talked about, was what to do with the people who've been in our country for more than a limited period of time. And that's a difficult issue, and it's one that's got a lot of politics in the country. The idea of giving someone automatic citizenship is just not acceptable. It's not acceptable to a lot of people in our country, and, Massimo, you understand that. And yet the fundamental question is, how do you design a system that doesn't raise those fears?

[SEP] Alright, let me address Iran one more time. We have a political framework established between Iran and the P-5-plus-1. Some aspects, such as centrifuge reductions at Natanz, are highly specific. Others are expressions of intent, but the specifics are crucial. The interpretation of these details will be subject to negotiation. It's inaccurate to suggest that everything is finalized.

Sadly, the Labour Party and other MPs have, so far, stopped us from delivering Brexit and that deal.But we will—but obviously, this is an issue that is going to continue here in the U.K. I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit. And once we're out of the European Union, we will be able to do what we've been talking about today and develop not just that free trade agreement, but a broader economic partnership into the future.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, on Iraq, you've talked repeatedly about the threat of Al Qaida in Iraq. And we've also heard a lot about the military progress that's been made against that group. Can you tell Americans how close the United States is to declaring victory against that group? And if you're not able to do so, does that suggest that your critics are correct that this war cannot be won militarily? [SEP] The Iraq situation cannot be won by military means alone. There has to be political reconciliation to go with it. There has to be a emergence of a democracy. That's been my position ever since it started.Al Qaida is still dangerous. They're dangerous in Iraq; they're dangerous elsewhere. Al Qaida is not going to go away anytime soon. That's why it's important for us to be finding out what their intentions are and what are their plans, so we can respond to them. This is a—this war against Al Qaida requires actionable intelligence. That's why this FISA bill is important. And they still want to do us harm, Elaine, and they're still active. Yes, we've hurt them bad in Iraq, and we've hurt them bad elsewhere. If you're the number-three person in Al Qaida, you've had some rough goes— you've been captured or killed. And we're keeping the pressure on them all the time.And so yes, we're making progress.

We scrapped the transgender military ban, signed the Respect for Marriage Act, boosted LGBT rights. But we're battling hysteria and prejudice. Firing someone for being gay? Wrong. Violence? Rising. These bills against transgender kids? Cruel. They're our kids. We're launching new protections: safety, rights, mental health. Congress needs the Equality Act. LGBTQ Americans, we got your back.

{"sentence": "Four years ago, you stated that the Taliban posed no threat to the Afghan people. Who do you believe has supported the Taliban in threatening security through kidnappings and attacks on government officials, and why? [SEP] Four years ago, I did say that, and I stand by it. The Taliban pose dangers to our innocent people, to children going to school, to our clergy, to our teachers, to our engineers, to international aid workers. They are not posing any threat to the Government of Afghanistan, to the institutions of Afghanistan, or to the buildup of institutions of Afghanistan. It's a force that's defeated, frustrated, and acting in cowardice by killing children going to school. The question of who is supporting them is one we've been working on for a long time. I hope the jirga between us and Pakistan will provide solutions. One thing is certain: we know their vision of how to govern. They've been in power and had the opportunity to show the world what they think and do. It would be instructive to speak to a mother of a young girl about life under the Taliban. These are brutal, cold-blooded killers. That's what they are. The fundamental question for those of us who believe in freedom is whether we confront them and whether it's worth the effort to spread an alternative to their hateful vision. We've concluded that it is. That's why President Karzai is here at Camp David, discussing common concerns and opportunities about how to defeat a vision of darkness. They don't believe in freedom. They don't believe it's possible to live in a society where people are allowed to express themselves freely. It's part of an ongoing challenge that the free world faces. The real question is whether those of us who have the blessings of liberty will continue to pursue policies aimed at protecting our homeland and laying a condition for peace to prevail.", "label": "General"}

[SEP] I'm not entirely sure about Medvedev's position. Observing their representation at the G-8 will be informative. However, it is crucial to maintain relations with Russia. We need their cooperation on preventing the spread of dangerous materials and addressing the situation with Iran. I remember Putin's proposal to supply enriched uranium to Iran's Bushehr plant, which I found helpful. Regarding missile defense in Europe, we must strive for mutual understanding.

[SEP] Well, I haven't had a chance to thoroughly review those specific reports or images yet. I'd prefer to get a detailed briefing from our embassy staff, who will undoubtedly be in contact with the Prime Minister, before offering a definitive assessment. It would be irresponsible of me to speculate without having all the facts.

Mr. President, regarding your recent remarks about President Xi and the broader issues of human rights in India, could you please reiterate the second part of my question concerning the treatment of religious minorities in India?

[SEP] Thank you. I'm not sure if I should be answering this question here, but I will try. We've been discussing importing Russian gas into South Korea for some time. We're now discussing with North Korea the possibility of Russian gas, which is quite affordable, passing through North Korea for use in South Korea. This is beneficial for Russia because they can sell their natural resources, for North Korea because they could use this natural resource, and also for South Korea. However, South Korea, North Korea, and Russia haven't yet discussed this in detail. While economically beneficial, this issue also involves security matters, which we will consider closely.

There are 20,000—the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down, and very substantially. And this weekend was one of the lowest we've had.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given Mayor Bloomberg's endorsement based on your climate change commitment, particularly post-Hurricane Sandy, what specific climate change policies will you champion in a second term? And do you believe there's enough political will in Washington to pass a carbon tax? [SEP] Mark, we can't say for sure that any one storm is because of climate change. But the world is getting hotter faster than we thought, and the ice in the Arctic is melting really fast too. We're seeing more and more crazy weather. I really believe that climate change is happening and that we're making it worse. We owe it to our kids and grandkids to do something about it. We doubled how good cars are on gas and made more clean energy, which helps. But we need to do more. I'm going to talk to scientists, engineers, and politicians to figure out how to cut carbon now and have a big talk with the country about what we can do for the long haul. I don't know what the Democrats or Republicans will do, since people in different places see things differently. It's going to take some tough choices to deal with climate change.

Mayor Ted Wheeler was noticeably absent from that agreement. Are you confident, sir, that the State of Oregon will be able to quell the protests in Portland? And if the violence does continue, would you consider redeploying Federal troops? [SEP] So our people have done—Homeland Security have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess.They went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings—right?—like courthouses.The Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency—which I consider now to be an emergency—it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement.Yesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it—and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, I think Trump wants to take over the country. It's crazy.So what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters—and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I'm going to be very happy. And then, slowly, we can start to leave the city. If they don't do it, we'll be sending in the National Guard.Please.", "label": "Explicit"}

A bipartisan bill passed out of the Senate, cosponsored by not just Democrats, but some very conservative Republicans who recognized that the system currently is broken and if in fact we put more resources on the border, provide a path in which those undocumented workers who've been living here for a long time and may have ties here are coming out of the shadows, paying their taxes, paying a fine, learning English—if we fix the legal immigration system so it's more efficient, if we are attracting young people who may have studied here to stay here and create jobs here, that that all is going to be good for the economy, it's going to reduce the deficit, it might have forestalled some of the problems that we're seeing now in the Río Grande Valley with these unaccompanied children.And so we have a bipartisan bill, Wendell, bipartisan agreement supported by everybody from labor to the evangelical community, to law enforcement. So the argument isn't between me and the House Republicans. It's between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans, and House Republicans and the business community, and House Republicans and the evangelical community. I'm just one of the people they seem to disagree with on this issue.So that's on the comprehensive bill. So now we have a short-term crisis with respect to the Río Grande Valley. They say we need more resources, we need tougher border security in this area where these unaccompanied children are showing up. We agree. So we put forward a supplemental to give us the additional resources and funding to do exactly what they say we should be doing, and they can't pass the bill. They can't even pass their own version of the bill. So that's not a disagreement between me and the House Republicans; that's a disagreement between the House Republicans and the House Republicans.The point is that on a range of these issues, whether it's tax reform, whether it's reducing the deficit, whether it's rebuilding our infrastructure, we have consistently put forward proposals that in previous years and previous administrations would not have been considered radical or left-wing; they would have been considered pretty sensible, mainstream approaches to solving problems. I'd include under that, by the way, the Affordable Care Act, but that's a whole other conversation.And in circumstances where even basic, commonsense, plain-vanilla legislation can't pass because House Republicans consider it somehow a compromise of their principles or giving Obama a victory, then we've got to take action. Otherwise, we're not going to be making progress on the things that the American people care about.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. German Press Agency, Kristina Dunst. Mr. President, your country is divided. You, as first Black President—as first African American President, who did so many things so differently, who raised so much hope all over the world, do you think that you have, perhaps in a way, too—put too much of a strain, maybe too much of demands on the Americans? And to what extent do you think your successor may well be a threat to the rest of the world, to the security? Because there are, after all, nuclear weapons here in Germany to which he has access now.Will you want to be now, Madam Chancellor, see to it under this—your administration try to make Europe and Germany less dependent on the United States? And are you afraid of this wave of populism hitting Germany, hitting Europe, as well?And a personal question: President Obama paid tribute to you as an outstanding politician. You are somewhat more sober in—when you describe your partner. How difficult is it for you to take leave today of your partner? [SEP] My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it's not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world.And based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I've done a pretty good job, that we haven't, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it.But what is certainly true is that the American people—just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world—are seeing extraordinarily rapid change. The world is shrinking. Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting. Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct. People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security. They're looking for some means of control.And what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries.And I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase. But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles—as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them, but also change governments if it's—they're not serving them well—then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue.And I think it's especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it's particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries—those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization—and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.And I think that can be done. But it's hard. It requires creativity. It requires effective communications. Part of what's changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information. It's easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we'll figure it out.So, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America's futures, but the direction that the world is going in. And part of what makes me most optimistic is, if you look at the attitudes of young people. Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences. They are much more comfortable with diversity. They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between us and them. They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders.So that's where the future is. But we have to create that bridge to the future. And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped to get us here. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. Well, on the issue, first, of independence of Germany, after the time of National Socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America. The fact that we were able to enjoy European—sorry, German unification is due, first and foremost, to the help of the United States of America. And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country.Now, we're trying to do more than it used to be 26 years ago. And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution. We will all have to make—do more in development cooperation. It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked. Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate, which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union. We cannot stand alone with 80 million people. In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much, even though you may be economically strong. So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation. And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole.Secondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at—and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States. Look at the European Parliament. We—there are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, for—who are sort of preaching policies of, well, very unfriendly policies. We have them here in Europe too. We have them here in Germany too.And to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society. Look at the history of the printing press, when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had, or industrialization, what sort of consequences that had. Very often, it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this. And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a transition from agricultural societies to industrial societies.Now, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country. We have it in other countries. Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days—trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place.But those that are—belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others—that is something that we cannot allow to happen. That is something that I think, at the time in the GDR—at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people—that was something that filled me with great joy. But the fact that these people have hijacked it certain is not something that fills me with great joy. We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people. But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so.Now, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard. If you've worked together with somebody very well, leave-taking is very difficult. But we are all politicians. We all know that democracy lives off change. So, in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this. It's a tough rule: Eight years, and that's it. Out goes the President, and a new one comes in. So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead. But our personal—we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game. So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say.

Who is ultimately calling the shots on this issue? Are you actively pursuing its closure, and do you anticipate Guantanamo's closure by the end of your term? [SEP] Well, I did indeed express the desire to close Guantanamo, but the reality is more complex. A significant hurdle is the reluctance of other nations to repatriate detainees. We need viable destinations for these individuals. The recent Senate resolution, with overwhelming opposition to housing these prisoners domestically, highlights this challenge. It's not as simple as flipping a switch. Furthermore, to say nothing has been done is inaccurate. We are actively engaged in repatriation efforts, though many nations understandably hesitate to accept individuals with violent pasts. We're also committed to ensuring humane treatment upon their return. Another key aspect is establishing trial mechanisms. We're working with the courts and the Defense Department to expedite these processes. The sooner trials commence, the better. I won't make definitive predictions about Guantanamo's future.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning your upcoming summit with Kim Jong Un, given that your CIA Director's recent visit to Pyongyang failed to secure the release of detained Americans or any tangible concessions from North Korea, are you still prepared to meet with Kim Jong Un if Americans remain imprisoned? Will you insist on concrete concessions from North Korea in exchange for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State? [SEP] The situation is this: they *do* hold three prisoners. We are in discussions regarding their release. We are negotiating, doing our utmost. They have been held for a considerable time, and the treatment has been harsh. We fought diligently to secure Otto Warmbier's return, but he was in very poor health. It was a tragic event. We are working equally hard to bring back the three American citizens. I believe there is a strong possibility of success. We are engaged in productive dialogue. We will keep you informed. We are fully engaged and working diligently. We have made significant progress with North Korea. For many years, there have been talks with North Korea, but without results. Previous administrations should have addressed this issue when it was less advanced. However, we have imposed exceptionally powerful sanctions and taken other measures. I want to publicly thank President Xi of China, who has done more for us than for any other administration. He has effectively secured the border, and he has done so powerfully. He has stated that he never anticipated taking such measures, and I appreciate it greatly. It has exerted significant pressure. Ninety-three percent of goods entering North Korea originate from China. President Xi understands that these coming months are crucial. He does not want a Korea with nuclear weapons. He is also acting in China's interests. He has been outstanding. Can he improve? Always. But he has been very effective, and it has had a substantial impact. We have never been in this position with that regime. I hope to have a highly successful meeting. If we do not believe it will be successful, we will not hold it. If the meeting is not productive, I will respectfully withdraw, and we will continue our current course of action. Something will occur. I prefer to remain flexible. I have brought us to this point. President Moon of South Korea generously stated that without Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a complete failure. It was my involvement that made the Olympics a success. Ticket sales were problematic before our involvement with North Korea. We have brought ourselves to this point, and I believe we will be successful.

I'm wondering if you can talk about your specific discussions with President Xi on that.To what extent do you think China has the ability to talk North Korea out of conducting such tests? And what are the repercussions for U.S.-Chinese relations if a test goes forward? [SEP] Well, first of all, it's difficult to say that I am certain that China can control North Korea, number one.Number two, I've made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long-range nuclear tests. And I made it clear as well that if they did—they meaning North Korea—that we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf, and it would not be directed against North Korea—I mean, excuse me—it would not be directed against China, but it would be to send a clear message to North Korea. We are going to defend our allies, as well as American soil and American capacity.And so—but I do not think that—it's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity. I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means. Because I made it clear—and I made it clear from the very beginning, and last year as well, that we will do what it needs to defend our capacity, to defend ourselves and our allies—South Korea, as well as Japan—and that it would be—we'd be more up in the face of China. But it wouldn't be because of China, it'd be because of what was going on in North Korea.So—and again, on a number of these issues, we have put together teams where our National Security Adviser, Secretary of Defense, and others are going to be engaging with their counterparts in China to see—and we're not going to be able to work everything out. I'm not suggesting it's going—this is kumbaya, you know, everybody is going go away with everything in agreement. But I do not believe that there's a need for concern of a, as one of you raised the legitimate question, a new cold war.And I think that—I'll conclude by saying it this way: I want to be clear—and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping—that I mean what I say and I say what I mean, so there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern is—I have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions on each of our parts.So we went in to—I'll look at my team—how long did that meeting last?

How do you convey that their continued sacrifice is also worthwhile to them? [SEP] Leo, let's remember the timeline for our withdrawal to an Embassy-centered presence by the end of 2016 remains unchanged. Our transition out of a combat role remains unchanged. I acknowledge the risks for our troops in Afghanistan; it's a dangerous place. However, casualties have decreased significantly as we've drawn down. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed there, precisely because we're not in a combat role. The Afghan security services have made significant sacrifices, stepping up as we've drawn down. They're fighting with courage and tenacity, improving month by month. But we can't minimize the sacrifices our military families make. Some will rotate back into Afghanistan for a few extra months. We're essentially shifting the drawdown pace to compensate for the delayed government formation and to ensure we're helping Afghan security forces succeed, preventing a return due to terrorist activities launched from Afghanistan. We're on track, and as Commander in Chief, I believe providing a few extra months to help with logistics, equipment usage, training, advising, and strategic input is wise. President Ghani, as Commander in Chief, is conducting a serious review to assess strengths and weaknesses for more effective joint planning. Our troops and their families make enormous sacrifices. This means some who would have been home will remain in Afghanistan under the new schedule. However, we've gone from 100,000 to under 10,000, and they're not on the front lines. Force protection is a priority. The drawdown completion date remains unchanged. General Campbell and others on the ground believe this additional timeframe to help Afghan security forces succeed is worthwhile. We're asking our troops to fight for our freedom and a more orderly world. This raises a point about budgets. It's a good time for Congress to review their budgets.

I think Boeing—we had the General Motors strike; that was a big impact on GDP.And of course, we're paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the Fed. I'm not happy with what that is, because he's kept interest rates. President Obama didn't have near the numbers. And yet, if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We're paying interest. Now, it's more conservative. And frankly, people that put their money away are now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything.But I think, you know, we're the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates—meaning, they're literally getting paid when they put out money. I mean, they borrow money, and they get paid when it gets paid back. Who ever heard of this before? It's a first. But we don't do that.So I totally disagree with our Fed. I think our Fed has made a terrible mistake, and it would have made a big difference, as good as we've done, even without the 2,000 points. And we started off at 16,000, and we'll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody has seen before. But we're doing well. But we have to watch—we're doing well, anyway, in other words, even despite the 2,000 points. It sounds like a lot, and it's a lot. But it's nothing—it's very little compared to what we've gone up.But we'll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by General Motors. We've been hurt by Boeing. And we've hurt by—we've been hurt, in my opinion, very badly, by our own Federal Reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar. That's something nice about a strong dollar, but it makes it much harder to do business outside of this country.", "label": "Deflection"}

Beyond the veterans bill and executive orders, what tangible results can you point to? Are you accepting the possibility of facing the electorate in 2012 with persistent unemployment and questions about your leadership? [SEP] Well, let's be clear: the American people are questioning Congress's inaction on the jobs bill, a bill filled with ideas supported by most Americans, even Republicans. That's why Congress is held in such low regard. Usually, when the public disapproves, you change course. But Congress, particularly Republicans, seem indifferent to the urgency of putting people back to work. I'll keep fighting. I hope we can get some of it done now, but it may take until November, or even a new Congress, to get it all done. We're talking about tax cuts for the middle class, tax breaks for small businesses hiring veterans or the long-term unemployed, and getting teachers back in the classroom. Take Hawaii, where kids are only in school four days a week due to budget cuts. How can we compete in the 21st century with that? The jobs bill would ease those state-level budget issues. And rebuilding our infrastructure. Every world leader asks how we can ensure we have top-notch infrastructure. When you travel through Asia, you see better airports and ports than ours. That impacts our ability to do business, to trade, to get American goods made by American workers into the fastest-growing markets. And we could put a lot of people back to work doing it.

Therefore, I cannot offer specific commentary on the case itself. However, I can address the broader implications. I've previously stated that this conversation was necessary and important.

Following this summit, will there be changes in migration policies and the treatment of migrants? Finally, President Biden, what concrete actions will be implemented regarding fentanyl, and what is the impact of Ovidio Guzmán's detention? And lastly, did you discuss energy sector consultations under the USMCA? [SEP] We discussed migration broadly, cooperating with the U.S. while committing to protect migrants. President Biden's proposal is correct: migrants face risks crossing our country, including human traffickers charging high fees. These traffickers have networks and use trucks to transport hundreds, leading to accidents. Many migrants are kidnapped and murdered, which is very sad. We want an in-depth solution. People don't leave their homes for pleasure but out of necessity. We must address the root causes and invest in development in countries with inequality and poverty, making migration an option, not a forced situation. Meanwhile, Mexico is helping with limited resources, working with communities in El Salvador and Honduras, and soon in Guatemala and Belize. We need more development to ensure opportunities for those forced to migrate. We aren't building a migration center in southeastern Mexico but helping with shelters, healthcare, and food. We celebrate the U.S. decision for orderly migration, like with Venezuelan citizens. Since announcing humanitarian visas for Venezuelans, migration flows have decreased. This new path offers hope, allowing people to file requests. Canada's actions are also right. Historically, migration was from Central America and Mexico, with 40 million Mexicans in the U.S. With well-being support, we've reduced Mexican migrants. 30 million families receive a well-being program. Senior citizens receive pensions, and low-income students get scholarships. We have a reforestation program, employing 400,000 peasants. These programs help people stay in their communities. We built the Dos Bocas refinery and are building the Mayan train, creating jobs. Development is the path. I celebrate Canada and the U.S. addressing migration this way. Some politicians act inhumanely, like governors sending migrants to New York and Washington. We must seek alternatives, addressing the root causes of violence. We didn't care for our youth, who were labeled as not working or studying. We now have a program for young people, hiring 2.4 million as apprentices, taking them away from criminal groups.

And it was out of control.And I gave the orders, and we have a hundred percent of the caliphate. We have tens of thousands of people in prisons now. They're being guarded by the Kurds and others. Europe should take a lot of them back. So far, they haven't agreed to do that. They should do that because we did them a big favor. We captured them. But I did that.We killed al-Baghdadi a few months ago. And Soleimani was—is gone. He's no longer putting roadside bombs all over the place. Somebody else may be, but he was the father—the king—of the roadside bomb. All of those young people that you see with missing legs and—missing legs and arms. I've seen every combination. The legs are gone. You go over to Walter Reed—I have to say, the doctors at Walter Reed are incredible, what they're able to do. Incredible.But that's what his thing was. He thought that was a beautiful weapon: roadside bombs. It's a coward's bomb. And all of these young people that have been so badly hurt. And we did a big favor.In addition to that, as you know, Hamza bin Laden is now gone. And he was looking to do damage. And he's gone. And Al Qaida, last week, you saw what happened there.So nobody has done more than what I've done. And—but at the same time, Russia should do it. Iran should do it. Iraq should do it. Syria should do it. You know, we're in a different part of the world. We're doing it. Everybody says, You're the only ones that can do it.

{"sentence": "Given the extensive evidence presented by U.S. intelligence agencies, why should the American public, and President Trump in particular, accept your assurance that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election? Furthermore, will you entertain the extradition of the twelve Russian officials indicted by a U.S. grand jury last week? [SEP] Let me address the latter part of that inquiry first, although the President is better positioned to provide a definitive response. The notion of Russian interference, as you know, emerged somewhat before the election, gaining traction as a rationale for the Democratic Party's defeat. It's worth noting that the Electoral College system inherently favors the Democrats, yet they were unable to secure victory. Our campaign was exceptionally well-executed, and that's why I am here today. As for the question of trust, I would caution against blind faith in any individual. President Trump acts in the best interests of the United States, just as I champion the interests of the Russian Federation. We share common objectives and seek areas of cooperation, while acknowledging our differences and striving for reconciliation. Rather than being swayed by immediate political considerations, we should prioritize factual evidence. Can you cite a single, irrefutable fact that substantiates the claim of collusion? Such allegations are baseless. While public sentiment in the United States may have leaned a certain way during the campaign, this is not unusual. It's only natural for individuals to express support for a candidate who advocates for improved relations with our nation. Regarding the Concord matter, the company in question engaged American legal counsel, and the accusations against them are unlikely to hold up in U.S. courts. Therefore, we must rely on facts, not speculation. Turning to the matter of the twelve alleged Russian intelligence officers, I will investigate the matter further. Russia and the United States have a treaty dating back to 1999, the Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases. This treaty is fully operational and effective. We can offer that the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller—he can use this treaty as a solid foundation, and send a formal, an official request to us so that we would interrogate—we would hold the questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Edward Szall with TruNews. President Trump, your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the deal of the century.

We're just getting started.We have—and as you know we have a very good—David Friedman a great gentleman. One of the most successful lawyers in New York who loves Israel—David Friedman. Jason Greenblatt who worked for me and my company great great lawyer. Great talent. Jared Kushner. And with me being President if you don't get that deal done it will never happen. We'll have to see what happens.But I think the Palestinians basically—I'm not sure—I know they want to make a deal but they want to be a little bit cute and that's okay. I fully understand where they're coming from.As you know I've ended the money to—that was—we were paying them $550 million a year and I ended that money because a year ago I heard they were saying nasty things. I said: Wait a minute. We're trying to make a deal. We're trying to help them and they're saying these nasty things? We're not going to pay.Now if a deal is made we would go back on a humanitarian basis. Not so different from the border. Because you see the problems and what's going on. It's terrible. But I think we have a very good chance of making a deal and a lot of people think that's probably the toughest deal of all. And it may very well be the toughest deal of all. A lot of people think it can't be made. I mean over the years a lot of people would say That's a deal that can't be made no matter what.But you know hey I like to—we're going to try.

Because they were always very hostile. And they said: No we wouldn't do that. That's inappropriate. Why is it inappropriate? I mean they're saying bad things. Why is it inappropriate?And what I've done is said Look as long—if you're not negotiating and if you don't want to make peace we're not going to pay you.

Maybe something will happen faster but you know that's going to be going on for about 3 months.There's a good chance we could—there's a chance. I don't want to even say good chance on that one because people say it's the hardest deal. I've heard—when I was young I'd say What do you think of this? They'd say Oh that's tougher than Israel and the Palestinians making a deal. They used to use that as like the metaphor. They used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions--one on Afghanistan. How can you lecture Hamid Karzai about corruption when so many of these corrupt people are on the U.S. payroll?And on the Middle East, do you believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should extend the settlement moratorium as a gesture to peace? And if he doesn't, what are you prepared to do to stop the Palestinians from walking? [SEP] Okay. On Afghanistan, we are in the midst of a very difficult but very important project. I just want to remind people why we're there, the day before September 11th. We're there because that was the place where Al Qaida launched an attack that killed 3,000 Americans. And we want to make sure that we dismantle Al Qaida and that Afghanistan is never again used as a base for attacks against Americans and the American homeland.Now, Afghanistan is also the second poorest country in the world. It's got an illiteracy rate of 70 percent. It has a multiethnic population that mistrusts, oftentimes, each other. And it doesn't have a tradition of a strong, central Government.So what we have done is to say, we are going to--after 7 years of drift, after 7 years of policies in which, for example, we weren't even effectively training Afghan security forces, what we've done is to say, we're going to work with the Afghan Government to train Afghan security forces so they can be responsible for their own security. We are going to promote a political settlement in the region that can help to reduce the violence. We are going to encourage a Afghan Government that can deliver services for its people. And we're going to try to make sure that as part of helping President Karzai stand up a broadly accepted, legitimate Government, that corruption is reduced.And we've made progress on some of those fronts. I mean, when it comes to corruption, I'll just give you an example. Four years ago, 11 judges in the Afghan legal system were indicted for corruption. This year, 86 were indicted for corruption. We have seen Afghan-led efforts that have gone after police commanders, significant businesspeople in Afghanistan. But we're a long way from where we need to be on that.And every time I talk to President Karzai, I say that as important as it is for us to help you train your military and your police forces, the only way that you are going to have a stable Government over the long term is if the Afghan people feel that you're looking out for them, and that means making sure that the tradition of corruption in the Government is reduced.And we're going to keep on putting pressure on them on that front. Is it going to happen overnight? Probably not. Are there going to be occasions where we look and see that some of our folks on the ground have made compromises with people who are known to have engaged in corruption? We're reviewing all that constantly, and there may be occasions where that happens.And I think you're certainly right, Helene, that we've got to make sure that we're not sending a mixed message here. So one of the things that I've said to my national security team is, let's be consistent in terms of how we operate across agencies. Let's make sure that our efforts there are not seen as somehow giving a wink and a nod to corruption. If we are saying publicly that that's important, then our actions have to match up across the board. But it is a challenging environment in which to do that.Now, with respect to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Middle East, a major bone of contention during the course of this month is going to be the potential lapse of the settlement moratorium. The irony is, is that when Prime Minister Netanyahu put the moratorium in place, the Palestinians were very skeptical. They said, ah, this doesn't do anything. And it turns out, to Prime Minister Netanyahu's credit and to the Israeli Government's credit, the settlement moratorium has actually been significant. It has significantly reduced settlement construction in the region. And that's why now the Palestinians say, you know what, even though we weren't that keen on it at first or we thought it was just window dressing, it turns out that this is important to us.What I've said to Prime Minister Netanyahu is that given so far the talks are moving forward in a constructive way, it makes sense to extend that moratorium so long as the talks are moving in a constructive way. Because ultimately, the way to solve these problems is for the two sides to agree what's going to be Israel, what's going to be the state of Palestine. And if you can get that agreement, then you can start constructing anything that the people of Israel see fit, in undisputed areas.Now, I think the politics for Prime Minister Netanyahu are very difficult. His coalition--I think there are a number of members of his coalition who've said, we don't want to continue this. And so one of the things that I've said to President Abbas is, you've got to show the Israeli public that you are serious and constructive in these talks so that the politics for Prime Minister Netanyahu--if he were to extend the settlements moratorium--would be a little bit easier.And one of the goals I think that I've set for myself and for my team is to make sure that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu start thinking about how can they help the other succeed, as opposed to how do they figure out a way for the other to fail. Because if they're going to be successful in bringing about what they now agree is the best course of action for their people, the only way they're going to succeed is if they are seeing the world through the other person's eyes. And that requires a personal relationship and building trust. Hopefully, these meetings will help do that. Okay?Ann Compton [ABC Radio].", "label": "Implicit"}

But the conflict between Russia and Georgia is putting a stop to this. What do you think we should do to help resolve this conflict between Russia and Georgia? [SEP] Precisely what we ought to do is help resolve the conflict and use our diplomats to convince people there is a better way forward than through violence. We haven't seen violence yet. The idea is to head it off in the first place. I spoke to Vladimir Putin about this very subject when I saw him in the Far East last week. I know that the President has spoken with President Saakashvili as well. The tenor of the conversation appears to be improving to me, that people understand that the best way to resolve their differences is to sit down at the table and solve them diplomatically. And so we'll continue to work along those lines.I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. This communique has a commitment that all countries will refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies. I'm wondering what you think that means concretely when it comes to China's behavior, what you expect from them?And also, I'm wondering, when it comes to Congress, if you think your party, the Democratic Party, would benefit from new blood, new leadership? [SEP] I've been very clear and persistent since I came into office that we welcome China's rise. We think the fact that China has grown as remarkably as it has, has lifted millions of people out of poverty, and that is ultimately good for the world and good for America, because it means that China has the opportunity to be a responsible partner. It means that China can be an enormous market for the United States, for Korea, for countries throughout Asia and around the world. And it's just good to get people out of poverty and give them opportunity.What I've also said is that precisely because of China's success, it's very important that it act in a responsible fashion internationally. And the issue of the RMB is one that is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world. It is undervalued, and China spends enormous amounts of money intervening in the market to keep it undervalued.And so what we've said is, it's important for China in a gradual fashion to transition to a market-based system. Now, this is something that China has done in the past. And China has also acknowledged that it needs to transition to a more balanced growth strategy internally, where they're focusing on their enormous domestic market and giving their people the opportunity to buy goods and services and consume, all of which will promote their growth, but also will reduce some of the imbalances around the world.And so what this communique, I think, communicates, not just to China, but to all of us, is letting currencies reflect market fundamentals, allowing your currency to move up and down, depending on the role that you're playing in the international trading system, is the best way to assure that everybody benefits from trade rather than just some. And the communique strongly communicates that principle.My expectation is that China is going to make progress on this issue. President Hu is going to be visiting me in Washington in January, and our hope and expectation is, is that we will continue to see progress on this front.It means some adjustments for China. And so we're--we understand that this is not solved overnight. But it needs to be dealt with, and I'm confident that it can be.Sheryl Stolberg.Oh, I think that what we will naturally see is a whole bunch of talented people rise to the top as they promote good ideas that attract the American people when it comes to jobs and investment and how to grow the economy and how to deal with our challenges.

{"sentence": "Given the evolving situation in Libya, what specific benchmarks must be met before the U.S. transfers command, and why is NATO the preferred partner for this transition? [SEP] Well, the situation remains fluid, as you know. The timing of any transfer hinges on the assessment of our field commanders regarding the completion of the initial phase, specifically neutralizing Libyan air defenses. This is paramount to ensure the no-fly zone's effectiveness and the safety of coalition aircraft. Humanitarian considerations are also key. While I anticipate this occurring within days, not weeks, the specifics are best left to the Pentagon. NATO's coordinating role is invaluable due to its capabilities. As for this partnership, let's just say it's a two-way street. Chile has much to offer, particularly in clean energy. We're exploring collaborations in education and security, addressing issues like narcotrafficking. This isn't about a developed nation aiding a less developed one; it's a collaboration among equals. Regarding Latin American integration, we lag behind Europe. While the idea of a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego was once floated, it never materialized. Latin America needs to fulfill its potential, drawing on shared values and principles with the U.S. We seek a partnership that encompasses democracy, free trade, education, and innovation.

{"sentence": "Q. Could the terror threats be the reason you have skipped Kenya in your visits to Africa? [SEP] Oh, no, no, no. [] The—well, first of all, with respect to journalists in the media, the last session that we had on good governance emphasized that good governance means everybody has a voice, that government is transparent and thereby accountable. And even though leaders don't always like it, the media plays a crucial role in assuring people that they have the proper information to evaluate the policies that their leaders are pursuing.And so we have been very consistent in pushing governments not just in Africa, but around the world, to respect the right of journalists to practice their trade as a critical part of civil society and a critical part of any democratic norm. The specific issue of the Al Jazeera journalists in Egypt, we've been clear both publicly and privately that they should be released. And we have been troubled by some of the laws that have been passed around the world that seem to restrict the ability of journalists to pursue stories or write stories. We've also been disturbed by efforts to control the Internet. Part of what's happened over the last decade or two is that new media, new technology allow people to get information that previously would have never been accessible or only to a few specialists. And now people can punch something up on the Internet and pull up information that's relevant to their own lives and their own societies and communities. So we're going to continue to push back against these efforts.As is true on a whole range of issues—and I've said this in the past—many times, we will work with countries even though they're not perfect on every issue. And we find that in some cases, engaging a country that generally is a good partner, but is not performing optimally when it comes to all of the various categories of human rights, that we can be effective by working with them on certain areas and criticizing them and trying to elicit improvements in other areas. And even among countries that generally have strong human rights records, there are areas where there are problems. That's true of the United States, by the way.And so the good news—and we heard this in the summit—is that more and more countries are recognizing that in the absence of good governance, in the absence of accountability and transparency, that's not only going to have an effect domestically on the legitimacy of a government, it's going to have an effect on economic development and growth. Because ultimately, in an information age, open societies have the capacity to innovate and educate and move faster and be part of the global marketplace more than closed societies do over the long term. I believe that.Now, with respect to terrorism, I think there's uniform concern of terrorist infiltration in many countries throughout Africa. Obviously, this is a concern that we have globally. A lot of the initiatives that we put forward were designed to partner so that countries, first and foremost, can deal with these problems within their own borders or regionally. And the United States doesn't have a desire to expand and create a big footprint inside of Africa. What we do want to make sure we can do is partner with the African Union, with ECOWAS, with individual countries to build up their capacity.And one of the encouraging things in the sessions was a recognition that fighting terrorism also requires security forces that are professional, that are disciplined, that themselves are not engaging in human rights violations; that part of the lesson that we've all learned about terrorism is that it is possible in reaction to terrorism to actually accelerate the disease if the response is one that alienates populations or particular ethnic groups or particular religions. And so the work that we're doing, including the security initiatives that I announced today, I think can make a big difference in that direction.It's not just a matter of us providing better equipment or better training. That's a part of it, but part of it is also making sure that these security forces and the intelligence operations are coordinated and professional and they're not alienating populations. The more we do that, the more effective we can be.Last point I'll make is, on good governance, one of the best inoculators against terrorist infiltration is a society in which everybody feels as if they have a stake in the existing order and they feel that their grievances can be resolved through political means rather than through violence. And so that's just one more reason why good governance has to be part of the recipe that we use for a strong, stable, and prosperous Africa.Last question, Jérôme Cartillier [Agence France-Presse].", "label": "Explicit"}

Recent water scarcity issues also underscore the critical need for essential resources in both daily life and industrial output. Securing a stable supply chain is paramount for our people and national economy, with implications for national and military security. While the WTO once promoted free trade, the pandemic and the rise of market blocs have created vulnerabilities in the supply chain.

And regarding Guantanamo, despite your stated intention to close it, it remains operational.

The primary obstacle is finding countries willing to repatriate detainees. We need a destination for these individuals. The Senate recently expressed strong opposition to housing these prisoners within the US. So, the practical challenge is: what becomes of these individuals? To suggest no progress has been made is incorrect. We are actively negotiating with other nations for the return of detainees. Many are dangerous, making repatriation difficult.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, given John Howard's emphasis on climate change at this APEC meeting, hasn't your scheduling of a separate meeting in Washington undermined his attempt to establish aspirational goals? And to what extent do you consider ratification of Kyoto as being relevant to addressing climate change? [SEP] Let me address the latter question first. As I get older, you may need to remind me of the first part. Kyoto may be suitable for other countries. It may have made sense for certain countries that ratified it; however, it simply didn't make sense for the United States. Therefore, I was honest. And by the way, prior to my arrival in Washington, the United States Senate had the opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of whether or not Kyoto made sense to the United States. There was a 95-to-nothing vote against Kyoto. So, it's not just my opinion; many people thought Kyoto wasn't the way to go. We developed a different approach: energy efficiency standards based upon new technologies. And as I mentioned, we reduced greenhouse gases in America last year, and our economy grew at 3 percent. I don't know if many countries can make that claim, but we can because our strategy of putting new technologies in place is working. I happen to believe that we can do a better job of becoming less dependent on foreign oil. As an energy exporter, that might kind of frighten some of the energy exporters. But we've got to reduce our dependency on oil and therefore have put forth what's called a 20-in-10 program. Over the next 10 years, we will reduce our gasoline consumption by 20 percent by using ethanol and other new technologies. I believe battery technology is coming, so people in Sydney can drive the first 40 miles in their cars on battery without your car looking like a golf cart. In other words, there are new technologies coming to market. The fundamental question is how to get them to market as quickly as possible? Kyoto didn't do that as far as we were concerned. As a matter of fact, if you begin to take an assessment or inventory of countries that are actually meeting the Kyoto targets, I think you'll find that maybe a different approach makes sense. So, the reason we rejected Kyoto is because it wouldn't have allowed us to do what we wanted to do, which is grow our economy, become less dependent on foreign oil, and be good stewards of the environment. John and I have discussed his desire to put climate change at the forefront of APEC, and I was a strong supporter of that. I also reminded him that at the G-8, I took the message that said to our partners there that if you really want to really solve the global climate change issue, let's get everybody to the table. Let's make sure that countries such as China and India are at the table as we discuss the way forward. Otherwise, I suspect, if they feel like nations are going to cram down a solution down their throat and not give them a voice on how to achieve a common objective, they'll walk. And then you can't have effective global climate change if a nation like China is not involved. I thought the Prime Minister did something smart in this protocol. He announced that we need to cut back on tariffs that prohibit the exportation of technologies that will enable China, for example, to burn coal in a cleaner way. In other words, they've protected their environmental industries. And he wants to tear down those tariffs and barriers, and we support him strongly on this, so that technology is more likely to be able to flow from those of us who have it to those who don't. There are fundamental questions: How fast can we get effective technology to the market—coal sequestration technologies, nuclear spent fuel reprocessing technologies to the market? And once to the market, can we help developing nations acquire those technologies? Otherwise, it's an exercise that's not going to be effective. I believe the strategy that we have laid forth is the most effective way to deal with this issue in a serious way. I also appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister is the one that brought the issue to focus and is talking about energy dependency, energy efficiency standards, which is a part of the global climate mix. He shows that leadership on the issue, and I'm proud to be here talking about the issue. Okay. Thank you.", "label": "Clarification"}

I wasn't criticizing the Prime Minister. I have great respect for her. The media, as usual, got it wrong. That's why we record these things now. It's called combating fake news. The Prime Minister will decide her own path. I simply ask that we ensure free trade, no restrictions. We want to trade with the UK, and they with us. We're their biggest partner, and we have huge potential to grow. If they choose a different path – and they want independence, which is fine – I just hope they can still trade with the US.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that continuous improvement is essential for all nations, ourselves included. We experienced a notable incident involving nuclear-tipped missiles some time ago, prompting Secretary Gates to implement significant changes. Therefore, every nuclear power must enhance its security measures. Pakistan is not exempt, and neither are we. This summit aims to address this very issue. On the matter of sanctions, we have a substantial number of countries on the Security Council who support this course of action. However, these negotiations can be challenging.

First, on Kyoto, it just wasn't the right path for America. The Senate made that clear long before I arrived. It was a 95-to-nothing vote, so it's not just my view. We're pursuing a different strategy, one based on technology and innovation. We've shown that you can reduce emissions and grow the economy at the same time. Now, regarding John's efforts, I'm fully supportive of addressing climate change, but it needs to be a global effort. We need to bring everyone to the table, including China and India. We can't just dictate terms; we need collaboration. And John's idea of cutting tariffs on clean technologies is a good one. We need to get these technologies to developing nations.

It'll be revealing to see who represents Russia at gatherings like the G-8. That'll provide some insight into Russia's foreign policy direction after Putin. I can't fully answer that at this point. It's crucial for us to maintain relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation, we must prevent the spread of dangerous materials. We need to work together on Iran. I appreciated Putin's offer to provide enriched uranium to Iran for the Bushehr plant, removing their need to enrich it themselves. That was a constructive gesture. We need to be able to work with Russia on Iran. There are many areas where we need to collaborate. Yesterday, with the Czech Prime Minister, I discussed missile defense in Europe. It's in our interest to help Russia understand the system isn't aimed at them but at genuine 21st-century threats, such as a launch from a violent regime with weapons of mass destruction. So, there are areas where we need to cooperate. I'm going to try to ensure my successor can have a relationship with whoever is steering foreign policy in Russia. It's in the country's best interest.

[SEP] On Crimea, it's not a done deal in that the international community largely rejects the annexation. Russia controls Crimea, and some residents support this. Forceful removal is unlikely. We're applying legal, diplomatic, political, and economic pressure. However, a simple solution is unlikely. History is unpredictable. The situation's evolution depends on international unity in condemning Russia's actions. Regarding Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, they're on Russian soil. We oppose intimidation, but Russia can legally have troops on its soil. Russia is still calculating. These calculations depend on unity from the US, Europe, and the international community in rejecting 21st-century dispute resolution methods. It's crucial to dismiss claims of threatened Russian speakers in Ukraine justifying Russian action. There's no evidence of threats. Provocateurs have caused scuffles. Comparisons to Kosovo, where thousands were slaughtered, are nonsensical. We must dispel excuses for Russian action.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Heading into Laos, what are the main things you can offer its leaders? And what do you plan to push for in return? On the offering side, for example, I'm wondering how you view U.S. responsibility for unexploded ordnance. On the asking side, what are you pushing for most? Is it human rights? Closer U.S. ties in the face of China? Improving their problems with governance and corruption? What's the priority? [SEP] Well look, symbolically, this is important. I'll be the first U.S. President to visit Laos. And when you think about the history of the United States and Laos, I think it's useful to see what's happened in the evolution of our relationship with Vietnam, a country that I just visited recently.At the outset, as we're trying to build trust, a lot of work can be done around war legacy issues. For the Lao, that involves dealing with unexploded ordnance, which is still plaguing big chunks of the countryside. And since Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by a lack of resources. We should help. And my expectation is, is that in our meetings over the course of several days, that we'll be able to provide some really concrete assistance that ensures that innocent kids who are running through a field or a farmer that's trying to clear a field or a business that's trying to get set up, that they're not endangered by the possibility of an explosion.Likewise, we have deep commitments to accounting for those who were lost during that war. And as was true with Vietnam—to the extent that we're able to find out more about our missing in action and our POWs—that not only provides enormous comfort and meaning for families and is consistent with our traditions, but it also ends up being a show of good faith on the part of the country and a way for us to move into a next phase of a relationship.And so a lot of the conversation, I think, will start there, but it doesn't end there. We've had an initiative, for example, helping all the countries along the Mekong Delta to find ways to harness development and deal with environmental issues. And that's something that we've been doing through ASEAN over the course of several years now. For us to be able to expand some of that work, I think, would be important. Establishing people-to-people exchanges is another area that historically has been important.I do think Laos, seeing the enormous economic progress that Vietnam and China and others have made, are going to be very interested in finding ways in which they can advance into the global economy and help themselves grow, and I think that we can be a useful partner there.So I think there will be a broad-based agenda. But if you think about the visit I made to Ho Chi Minh City and driving through those streets and the enormous wellspring of good will that you saw, that started with some of the same kinds of steps that we're going to be taking with Laos. But I think we can, hopefully, do it faster, make more progress faster than we did over the course of 10, 15 years, because we've learned some things. And I think Laos is very eager to engage with us, and we're eager to engage with them.So I look forward to visiting what I hear is a beautiful country.

{"sentence": "Q. When you talked about this in the past, you've minimized the benefits and you've highlighted some of the risks associated with that project. I'm wondering if you could tell us both what you would do when faced with that bill, given the Republican majority that we'll have in both Chambers, and also, what do you see as the benefits? And given the precipitous drop we've seen in oil prices recently, does that change the calculus in terms of how it would contribute to climate change, and whether you think it makes sense to go ahead with that project? [SEP] Well, I don't think I've minimized the benefits, I think I've described the benefits. If—at issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada. That oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf. Once that oil gets to the Gulf, it is then entering into the world market, and it would be sold all around the world.So there's no—I won't say no—there is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices, what the average American consumer cares about, by having this pipeline come through. And sometimes, the way this gets sold is, let's get this oil, and it's going to come here. And the implication is, is that's going to oil—lower gas prices here in the United States. It's not. There's a global oil market. It's very good for Canadian oil companies, and it's good for the Canadian oil industry, but it's not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers. It's not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.Now, the construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs. Those are temporary jobs until the construction actually happens. There's probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf. Those aren't completely insignificant; if—it's just like any other project. But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country, something that Congress could authorize, we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs or a million jobs. So if that's the argument, there are a lot of more direct ways to create well-paying American construction jobs.And then, with respect to the costs, all I've said is that I want to make sure that if in fact this project goes forward, that it's not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people, some of them long term, but significant costs nonetheless. If we've got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that.And as we're now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we're having to consider, how do we increase preparedness in how we structure infrastructure and housing and so forth along the Jersey Shore? That's an example of the kind of costs that are imposed, and you can put a dollar figure on it. So, in terms of process, you've got a Nebraska judge that's still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate. Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision.But I've just tried to give this perspective, because I think that there's been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula and—to what ails the U.S. economy, and it's hard to see on paper where exactly they're getting that information from.In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it won't have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks. When gas prices are lower, maybe they're more—less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices. But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market.

And I don't know if that's a question that I should be answering here in the United States, but since you asked a question I will try to answer that.In the Far East, we have been discussing this issue for quite some time in trying to import Russian gas into the Republic of Korea.

We're not looking for a fight, but we must address actions that violate international norms. There are potential areas of collaboration, perhaps even on strategic doctrine or climate. The best way forward is a direct, candid discussion. I assure you, I'll be very clear about our concerns.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Iran, what's the game plan? When do we start playing, and will their elections affect our strategy? Are they even interested in talking? [SEP] Look, Iran is a nation with a rich history, but their behavior hasn't exactly been conducive to global peace. Funding groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, threatening Israel, and pursuing nuclear weapons – these actions destabilize the region. We're reviewing our policy, exploring diplomatic avenues, and seeking opportunities for direct engagement. It won't be an overnight fix, given the deep mistrust. We'll be firm on our concerns: no funding of terrorism, no nuclear weapons. But there's potential for mutual respect and progress. Our approach to the Middle East, like George Mitchell's envoy role, shows our desire for change. Now, Iran needs to show they're willing to act differently and embrace their responsibilities as a member of the international community.", "label": "Dodging"}

Is there still time to repair the relationship during your presidency? Furthermore, are the claims of Israeli espionage during the Iran negotiations substantiated? And President Ghani, could you address the stalled reconciliation talks with the Taliban and the potential role of the U.S.? [SEP] I generally avoid commenting on intelligence matters publicly. We keep Congress, Israel, and our allies informed about the Iran deal. Any agreement will be transparent and verifiable, ensuring security for America, Israel, and the region. Regarding Israeli-Palestinian relations, the key is what the parties believe is achievable. Netanyahu's pre-election statements suggested a Palestinian state was unlikely, and his subsequent conditions were impractical. The question is whether there's a framework offering Palestinians hope for a secure state alongside Israel. Based on Netanyahu's remarks, it's difficult to envision. Our commitment to Israel's security remains firm, but we must re-evaluate our approach to Israeli-Palestinian relations, as the two-state solution appears increasingly distant. This could lead to a dangerous escalation. Our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel is unaffected, but we must be realistic about the situation. This isn't a personal matter; it's a fundamental policy disagreement. We advocate for two states, while Netanyahu holds a different view.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

The messages might seem confusing at times, but that's because the science is constantly changing. As for the CDC, they're doing the best they can with the information they have. This is a brand-new virus, a brand-new phenomenon. We're learning as we go. It's like when we were dealing with polio. The recommendations changed over time as we learned more about the virus.

Actions speak louder than words, as they say. If they're serious about helping Iraq, they know what to do: stop the flow of weapons and suicide bombers. The conference itself was a positive step, bringing regional players together to support Iraq's democracy. It boosted the Iraqi government's confidence, which is crucial for reconciliation.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Russia and the new leader Medvedev, what's your take on his power dynamic with Putin, and what advice would you give your successor about dealing with Russia? [SEP] Frankly, I'm still assessing Medvedev myself. The upcoming G-8 summit might offer some clues about Russia's foreign policy direction post-Putin. It's too early to say definitively. Maintaining relations with Russia is vital, especially on issues like non-proliferation and Iran. I've appreciated Putin's past cooperation on Iran's nuclear program. We need to work with Russia on various fronts, including missile defense in Europe, to ensure they understand it's not aimed at them.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with anti-LGBTQ+ laws proliferating across the country and instances of violence on the rise, many are questioning the federal government's commitment to protecting this community. What assurances can you offer to LGBTQ+ Americans, particularly families with transgender children, who feel increasingly unsafe, and what concrete actions will you take to counteract these discriminatory state laws? [SEP] Let me start by saying that if you can connect me with that family you mentioned, I want to speak with them directly and assure them of our unwavering support. As president, I was proud to end the ban on transgender individuals serving in our military, and I signed the Respect for Marriage Act, among other things. However, the fight is far from over. We are facing a wave of prejudice and fear-mongering that is simply unacceptable. It is wrong that someone can be married in the morning and fired in the afternoon simply because of who they are. The violence and hate crimes targeting the LGBTQ+ community are abhorrent. The hateful bills targeting transgender children are terrifying families and criminalizing doctors. These are our children, our neighbors, and it is our moral imperative to protect them. I am announcing a series of new initiatives to protect the LGBTQ+ community, including strengthening physical safety, addressing civil rights violations, and expanding mental health resources. Congress must pass the Equality Act and send it to my desk. To all LGBTQ+ Americans, especially our children: you are loved, you are heard, and this administration has your back. Regarding AI, it is clear that it presents both incredible benefits and real risks. We are working with international partners to establish the necessary guardrails.

{"sentence": "President Bush, North Korea's nuclear declaration lacked information on weapons. Is that acceptable? You're removing them from the terror list despite Japanese abduction concerns. How will we address abductions after removal? Mr. Fukuda, did you urge President Bush to reconsider the delisting? If not, why? What U.S. cooperation will you seek on abductions post-delisting? [SEP] North Korea is still under the heaviest sanctions in the world. They can only get rid of them by proving they're keeping their promises. Taking them off the list doesn't mean the sanctions are gone. They have a lot to do to get rid of them. It's a step-by-step process. They destroyed the cooling tower, which we could see, and that's good. But we still have other worries, like the abductions. Some people think we should ask the U.S. to put them back on the list because of the abductions. But we're in a new stage with the nuclear issue, and we need to make it work because it's good for Japan. At the same time, we need to solve the abduction problem. We shouldn't let the nuclear progress stop us from working on the abductions. We need to talk to North Korea and make progress on both things.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, after your discussions with the U.S. President, are you now less concerned about the direction of climate change and Russia policies under his successor? Do you foresee a potential fracturing of the united European front against Russia? And following Mr. Trump's victory, would you consider it necessary to re-announce your candidacy as a matter of protocol? [SEP] Well, I generally avoid commenting on the internal affairs of other nations. However, I must commend Chancellor Merkel for her exceptional partnership. She stands as one of the few remaining leaders from our closest allies who was present when I first took office. Together, we've navigated numerous challenges. While we haven't always agreed on every matter, our shared core values, her unwavering integrity, her commitment to truthfulness, her thoughtful approach, her meticulous preparation, her dedication to prioritizing the interests of the German people while recognizing the importance of global engagement and effective participation in multilateral institutions – all of these qualities make her an outstanding leader. The decision of whether to seek re-election rests solely with her, and ultimately, it will be the German people who determine the future. If I were a German citizen with a vote, I might be inclined to support her. Regarding Russia, my stance has remained consistent throughout my time in office. Russia is a significant nation, a military superpower with considerable influence both regionally and globally. To address many of the world's pressing issues, it is in our best interest to collaborate with Russia and secure their cooperation. We should all aspire to a prosperous Russia, where its citizens are employed, its economy is thriving, and it maintains positive relationships with its neighbors while actively contributing to global challenges such as climate change. I have consistently sought a constructive relationship with Russia, while also acknowledging the significant differences in our worldviews. The values we hold dear – democracy, freedom of speech, international norms, the rule of law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations – are non-negotiable. Consequently, we have encountered substantial disagreements on issues such as Ukraine and Syria. My hope is that the incoming President-elect will adopt a similarly constructive approach, identifying areas where our values and interests align, while also standing firm against Russia when they deviate from our values and international norms. While I don't anticipate the President-elect adhering precisely to our blueprint, I hope he avoids a purely realpolitik approach that prioritizes short-term deals with Russia at the expense of international norms, the vulnerability of smaller countries, or the creation of long-term problems in regions like Syria. This is something we will learn more about as the President-elect assembles his team. I am encouraged by the President-elect's reaffirmation of the unwavering commitment to NATO. His full support for NATO as the cornerstone of our international security is of paramount importance. Finally, regarding my conversations with President Putin, these occurred before the election. As I have stated, there is clear evidence of their involvement in cyber attacks. This is not a new phenomenon, nor is it unique to Russia. We have observed low-level cyber attacks, industrial espionage, and other unacceptable behavior from various states. I conveyed a clear and forceful message that while we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering activities, even if we disapprove, there is a distinct difference between that and meddling in elections or targeting private organizations or commercial entities. We are closely monitoring the situation and will respond appropriately if and when we witness such actions. I believe that the issue of cyber security requires international cooperation to develop frameworks and norms to prevent a cyber arms race. Many countries possess advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerability of our infrastructure and economies to digital platforms, we must ensure that this does not become a lawless, low-level battlefield. We have begun to establish principles adopted by the G-20, the G-7, and the U.N., but much work remains to be done. Allow me to emphasize my admiration for the smooth transition of power in the United States, which adheres to democratic principles despite a challenging election campaign. This transition, focused on the American people and their destiny, involves the outgoing administration sharing its knowledge and expertise with the incoming administration. This encourages us to continue the strong cooperation between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, which is in our mutual interest. We will continue this cooperation with an open mind and a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. Regarding Russia, I can only reiterate what the President said. It is about respecting certain principles. From a European and German perspective, the fact that we have enjoyed peace for over 70 years depends on respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every European country. Disregarding this would be a dangerous step backward, and we must resolutely oppose any such attempts. We remain hopeful for political solutions, which is why we launched the Normandy process in close coordination with the United States. From a German and European perspective, Russia is our neighbor. Considering Poland's perspective, we have an interest in a positive relationship. We share historical ties, but this should not prevent us from addressing serious disagreements through political means and seeking political settlements. This is what I will continue to work on with all my heart. Regarding my candidacy, I will address that at the appropriate time, but not today.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, with the House seemingly poised to disapprove of your Iraq policy, does such a vote embolden our enemies and undermine your strategy? Furthermore, what steps are you taking to prevent Congress from restricting funding for the war? [SEP] Right, a couple of things. First, I recognize Congress will voice their concerns, and the Democrats, along with some Republicans, clearly disagree with my approach. That's fine; they're entitled to their opinions. I considered their viewpoints, but I believe they would hinder the establishment of a self-governing, self-sustaining ally in the fight against terror. Second, I hope this non-binding resolution doesn't morph into a binding policy that ties our troops' hands. It's contradictory to unanimously support General Petraeus and then deny him the resources he needs to implement his strategy, which he detailed before the Senate. I'm going to emphasize to Congress, starting now, the necessity of funding our troops and providing them with the flexibility to succeed. It's also curious that they're criticizing a plan before it's even had a chance to prove itself. Again, I understand their concerns.

{"sentence": "Q. Former President Barack Obama famously said that he had a pen and a phone to use executive power on issues like immigration.

But I got—I mean, he certainly used it. He used it on DACA. And when he did it, he said something to the effect that I'm not allowed to do this, it will never hold up, but I'm doing it anyway. And he did it, and they found judges that approved it. We also found judges that didn't approve it, so it's obviously going to be determined in the Supreme Court.And if the Supreme—if the Court rules in favor of what President Obama thinks they should rule—which is what he said—then I will probably have a deal with the Democrats in a very short period of time.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You're scheduled to meet this week with President Hollande in Washington to talk about stepping up efforts against ISIL even further. Given that Russia would be part of the coalition that France proposes, have you seen any signs in the past couple days of Russia redirecting its military efforts in Syria to actually focus on ISIL? Are you—are there any circumstances that you could see President Asad remaining in power, even if only temporarily, if that's what it took to effectively have a broad alliance directed at ISIL?And finally, as you've said, the U.S. won't work with Russia if their goal is to keep Asad in power. If that's the case, is defeating ISIL or destroying ISIL a realistic goal? [SEP] Well, first of all, destroying ISIL is not only a realistic goal, we're going to get it done, and we're going to pursue it with every aspect of American power and with all the coalition partners that we've assembled. It's going to get done.It will be helpful if Russia directs its focus on ISIL, and I do think that as a consequence of ISIL claiming responsibility for bringing down their plane, there is an increasing awareness on the part of President Putin that ISIL poses a greater threat to them than anything else in the region. The question at this point is whether they can make the strategic adjustment that allows them to be effective partners with us and the other 65 countries who are already part of the counter-ISIL campaign. And we don't know that yet.So far, over the last several weeks, when they started taking strikes in Syria, their principal targets have been the moderate opposition that they felt threatened Asad. Their principal goal appeared to be—if you follow the strikes that they took—to fortify the position of the Asad regime. And that does not add to our efforts against ISIL. In some ways, it strengthens it, because ISIL is also fighting many of those groups that the Russians were hitting.When we were in Turkey, I discussed with President Putin, in a brief pull-aside, his need to recognize that he needs to go after the people who killed Russian citizens. And those aren't the groups that they were currently hitting with strikes. So they're going to have to make an adjustment in terms of what they're prioritizing.More broadly—I've said this before; I said it to President Putin 5 years ago, and I repeated it to him just a few days ago—the issue with Asad is not simply the way that he has treated his people. It's not just a human rights issue. It's not just a question of supporting somebody who has been ruthlessly dropping bombs on his own civilian populations. As a practical matter, it is not conceivable that Mr. Asad can regain legitimacy in a country in which a large majority of that country despises Asad and will not stop fighting so long as he's in power, which means that the civil war perpetuates itself.And so the goal in Vienna is to see if—with all the countries around the table, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Iran and Russia, as well as the United States and other countries that have concerns about this—whether we can arrive at a political transition process that recognizes the need for a new government and can quell the fighting, bring about a cease-fire, and allows all of us to refocus our attention on this barbaric organization that is killing so many people.Russia has not officially committed to a transition of Asad moving out, but they did agree to the political transition process. And I think we'll find out over the next several weeks whether or not we can bring about that change of perspective with the Russians.Keep in mind that we all have an interest in maintaining a Syrian state, because we don't want complete chaos. I mean, and there are problems that we've seen in, for example, Lebanon, when the machinery of state entirely breaks down. So there—there's going to be a need for the international community and the United Nations to work in order to maintain a Syria—maintaining a Syrian state and be able to move forward with a political transition that's orderly. And that's going to be difficult, but that's what we have to focus on.In terms of the position of the United States and the other 65 members of the coalition, my view on Asad is, it will not work to keep him in power. We can't stop the fighting. Even if I were to cynically say that my priority is ISIL and not removing Asad regardless of the terrible things that he's done to his people, the United States could not stop the fighting in Syria by those who are opposed to Asad's rule. And so this is a practical issue, not just a matter of conscience. And I think that there are a large number of members of this coalition, including President Hollande, who agree with me on that.

Renewables are good, but we need to boost domestic oil and gas production. We haven't constructed a refinery in years. My suggestion to build them on old military bases was ignored. Simple supply and demand: less supply, higher prices. Taxing oil companies only exacerbates the problem. We should encourage domestic investment.

I think your government is smart enough to recognize the importance of India and the Australia-India relationship. This is your region, and you'll make your own bilateral decisions. The discussions around nuclear energy with India seem compatible with international law and the NPT. This is between India and Australia, not the U.S. On carbon emissions, I agree with your Prime Minister and most scientists that climate change is a real problem caused by human activity. Each country is finding its own way to reduce emissions. Australia has a bold strategy. In the U.S., we've doubled fuel efficiency standards and invested in clean energy research. We believe we can meet our commitments from Copenhagen and Cancun. I hope the U.S. can find further ways to reduce emissions.

{"sentence": "Given the focus on your Asia pivot, some suggest your reception in the region has been less than enthusiastic. Furthermore, with only four months remaining in your term and 60 prisoners still held at Guantanamo Bay, will the prison remain open when you leave office? [SEP] Look, as far as I can tell, my reception here has been great. Have you talked to the people in Laos? They seem pretty happy with my visit. Everywhere we've gone, we've had a good reception, like in Vietnam, where millions lined the streets. So, if this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me using the short stairs in China, I think that's a bit of an overreaction. Anyone reasonable, especially in the region, would be puzzled as to how that became a symbol of our work. If you look at what leaders and ordinary people are saying, and the real work we've done on everything from economic programs to development, to legacy of war issues, to supporting civil society and young people, the worry I've heard isn't that what we've done hasn't been important and successful. The worry is, will it continue? Other leaders are asking if America's interest and presence will be sustained. I hope my successor will keep this going, because there's a lot happening here. You've got countries taking off, one of the youngest populations in the world. This is where the action will be in terms of commerce, trade, and creating U.S. jobs. That's the feedback I've gotten, not just from leaders, but also from local newspapers and people. As for Guantanamo, I'm not ready to say that it might still be open, because we're still working to reduce the number of prisoners. I believe Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations, it makes counterterrorism cooperation harder, and it's not necessary and costs U.S. taxpayers a fortune. Is there a lot of resistance in Congress? Absolutely. But as we get the population down to 40 or 50 people and keep spending millions to house them, Americans should be asking why we're spending this money when it's not needed for our safety. Because of the politics in Congress, it's tough. But I expect to work hard over the next four and a half months.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, President-elect Trump has indicated he might lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for substantial nuclear stockpile reductions. Given your own arms control efforts, do you see this as a sound strategy? Knowing the demands of the office and Mr. Trump's style, what advice would you give his advisors to ensure effective dealings with Vladimir Putin? Furthermore, considering your recent actions regarding Russia, do you believe those sanctions should be viewed as leverage in future negotiations? [SEP] Well, let's consider a few things. First, it's in the best interest of America and the world to foster a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my guiding principle throughout my presidency. We've collaborated where our interests aligned. Early in my term, I actively encouraged Russia to become a constructive member of the international community, assisting their government in diversifying and strengthening their economy, and channeling the talents of the Russian people into more productive avenues. However, it's fair to say that after President Putin's return to the presidency, an escalating anti-American sentiment and a global approach seemingly based on the idea that anything America does must be detrimental to Russia, leading them to counteract our efforts, has revived a Cold War-era adversarial spirit, making the relationship more challenging. This was further solidified when Russia intervened in Crimea and parts of Ukraine. The sanctions, as you recall, were not imposed due to nuclear weapons issues. They were a response to the violation of Ukraine's independence and sovereignty through force by Russia. This wasn't just our assessment; it was the consensus of the entire international community. Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory, meddle in Ukrainian affairs, and support military proxies who have violated fundamental international law and norms. I've communicated to the Russians that the sanctions will be lifted as soon as they cease these actions. To maintain international norms, it's crucial that we don't conflate the reasons for these sanctions with other unrelated issues. Regarding nuclear matters, we negotiated the START II Treaty during my first term, significantly reducing nuclear stockpiles for both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further and conveyed this to President Putin, but they were unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump can restart those talks in a meaningful way, there's still considerable potential for further stockpile reductions. Our success in nonproliferation and nuclear security has been partly due to leading by example. I hope that continues. However, it's essential to remember that the sanctions against Russia are a direct result of their actions in Ukraine. The United States must uphold the fundamental principle that larger countries cannot invade and bully smaller ones. I've stated before that I expect Russia and Ukraine to maintain a strong relationship, given their historical, cultural, and social ties. However, Ukraine is an independent nation. This situation exemplifies the vital role America must continue to play in preserving basic norms and values globally, whether advocating for human rights, women's rights, or freedom of the press. The United States hasn't always been perfect in this regard. At times, we must engage with allies and partners who may not fully meet our desired standards for international rules and norms. However, I can assure you that in every multilateral forum—the United Nations, the G-20, the G-7—the United States has consistently championed these values. It's crucial for us to continue doing so, because if the largest, strongest democracy in the world isn't willing to stand up for these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.", "label": "Dodging"}

I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump. And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks.Lastly, sir, in these final weeks of your Presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar al-Asad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo?Chancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar al-Asad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally. Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate. I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem? [SEP] One of the great things about our democracy is, it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting. I've been the subject of protests during the course of my 8 years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests. So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign—I wouldn't advise them to be silent.What I would advise—what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election—is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter. And what I consistently say to young people—I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe—do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life.I think there is a tendency—because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up—there is a tendency, I think, to assume that that's always the case. And it's not. Democracy is hard work.In the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened. If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not—and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones—if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.And so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there's an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks.It's hard work. And the good news is, I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward.But I do think sometimes there's complacency. Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the cold war, who forget what it meant to have a wall. And I'll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where an easy equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate—where those distinctions aren't made. I've said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws; we've operated imperfectly. There are times when we've made mistakes. There are times where I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with. It's a work of constant improvement.But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties and an independent judiciary and fighting corruption, those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country, but also with respect to our foreign policy.And that should be remembered. Because at an age where there's so much active misinformation—and it's packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television—where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And you—we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we've come to take for granted.That was a long answer, wasn't it?

[SEP] You know, most people I see, you know, when I'm moving around the country, for example, they're not angry. And they're not hostile people. And they— well, they say, you never meet people who disagree; that's just not true. I've met a lot of people who don't agree with the decisions I make.

I don't know why they get angry. I don't know why they get hostile. It's not the first time, however, in history that people have expressed themselves in sometimes undignified ways.

And how hopeful are you that this progress will endure or even expand under the incoming administration? [SEP] I am incredibly proud of the progress our society has made in the last decade. While I believe we contributed in a meaningful way, the true heroes are the activists, the sons and daughters, and the couples who bravely declared, 'This is who I am, and I'm proud.' Their courage opened hearts and minds, and eventually, the laws followed. But none of this would have been possible without their activism, whether loud and visible or quiet and personal. Our administration's role was to help society move forward in a way that minimized backlash and respected the fact that these issues were often controversial. Take, for example, our approach to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' By being methodical, working with the Joint Chiefs, and demonstrating that it wouldn't impact the effectiveness of our military, we were able to achieve meaningful change. I am proud of the work of Secretary Gates, Chairman Mullen, and the Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately did the right thing. But again, this wouldn't have happened without the incredible transformation happening in society. When I awarded Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant every word. Her kindness and likability, projected into living rooms across the country, changed attitudes. That wasn't easy for her, and it's just one example of what was happening in communities nationwide. I'm proud that we were able to provide some support to help the movement advance. I believe this progress is irreversible because American society has changed, especially the attitudes of young people.

So, regarding that action plan, I wonder what kind of specific discussions you had today. Did you see eye to eye on this action plan? [SEP] In the past, when it came to extended deterrence, we just talked about a nuclear umbrella. That was what I thought about extended deterrence in the past.But beyond that, there could be many other aspects, including fighters, bombers, and missiles. So, regarding the timely deployment of such strategic assets, we did engage in the discussions today. And going forward, I believe that there will be more concrete discussions between our two sides. That was our agreement, and it will be between our NSCs.And also, as I already stated in the course of answering the question from the U.S. journalist: In order to prepare against a possible nuclear attack, our two countries combined military exercises, I believe, should be stepped up in many aspects. We had that discussion.Thank you.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. Hello, Mr. President, I am Park from CBS. And I would like to, first of all, welcome President Trump upon your second visit to the Republic of Korea. At the restricted bilateral meeting this morning, President Moon, you had mentioned that you will be accompanying President Trump to the DMZ, but the focus of the dialogue that will happen at the DMZ will be between President Trump and Chairman Kim. And you said that you are looking forward to much progress being achieved there.So at—once the contact is established between President Trump and Chairman Kim at the DMZ, what kind of progress do you expect in the subsequent negotiations? And is—how about the possibility of a third U.S.-North Korea summit happening before the end of the year?And my third question relates to the written interview that you had given to various agencies recently. And in that interview, you had mentioned that if North Korea, under complete inspection verification from the international community—if North Korea dismantles the nuclear complex in Yongbyon—then the international community could explore the sanctions relief, a partial sanctions relief.So has there been any discussions regarding this issue this morning? And what was the response from the U.S. side? [SEP] Yes. To answer your question, yes, I have been invited to visit Panmunjom with President Trump this afternoon. However, as I had mentioned, the focus of the dialogue today will be the dialogue between the United States and . And of course, President Trump and Chairman Kim will have a reunion and have subsequent dialogue, and I hope that—and I do believe that this is vastly significant for the dialogue that will follow after the meeting today.And also, today there will be a dialogue between the United States and . But as for the inter-Korean dialogue, this will happen at a later time.As for the question regarding the third U.S.- summit, I believe that how the reunion and the dialogue and the meeting turns out this afternoon will have a great say on when and whether the U.S.- summit will happen for the third time. So I do expect some progress there.As for the last question, the—what I had explained was that if goes through the dismantlement in a genuine way—dismantlement of the nuclear complex in Yongbyon—then this will mean that we will be entering—we will be arriving at the entrance of irreversible, substantive denuclearization.

I strongly believe the American justice system is capable of convicting those who murdered Americans and committed acts of terror. We can lock them up and make sure they never see the light of day. We've done it before. But there's been a lot of political rhetoric surrounding this, and people are understandably fearful. However, we are a resilient nation and shouldn't be intimidated by a handful of captured terrorists. In some cases, a military tribunal might be more appropriate, such as when it's difficult to assemble a chain of evidence that meets the standards of a regular court. We can reform the military commission system to ensure it meets the highest standards of due process. I'm prepared to collaborate with both parties to establish a sensible system for prosecuting terrorists in either regular courts or military tribunals, and then incarcerate them in secure prisons. The cost of maintaining Guantanamo is significantly higher.", "label": "Deflection"}

Does it mean that his departure is not a preamble or prerequisite for the future of Syria? [SEP] Regarding the coalition of the international community, I believe that the resolution approved by all at the Security Council enabled us to say that now the entire world is committed to fighting against Daesh Then—and this is what I will check when I travel to Moscow—we need one single goal; that is, to tackle terrorism and fight against Daesh militarily And I believe that we can have some further cooperation and coordination militarily to do moreAt the same time, we have to be clear when it comes to the political solution, the one that will enable us to find an outcome for Syria And in this respect, like we've said, and—but we can repeat it, Bashar al-Asad cannot be the future of SyriaIn Vienna, we are already working with all of the countries, even though they do not necessarily—they do not have the same stance: Turkey, Iran, Gulf countries, the United States, France, and of course, all of those who are meant to find a solution But we must work on that transition, a transition where Bashar al-Asad plays no role Because he's been the problem, so he cannot be the solution Just to comment very quickly, we've got a coalition of 65 countries who have been active in pushing back against ISIL for quite some time France has been a central part of that coalition, as have European countries, Arab countries Countries as far flung as Australia and countries in Southeast Asia are part of that coalitionRussia right now is a coalition of two, Iran and Russia, supporting Asad Given Russia's military capabilities and given the influence they have on the Asad regime, them cooperating would be enormously helpful in bringing about a resolution of the civil war in Syria and allow us all to refocus our attention on ISILBut I think it's important for—to remember that you've got a global coalition organized Russia is the outlier We hope that they refocus their attention on what is the most substantial threat and that they serve as a constructive partner And if and when they do, it will make it easier for us to go after ISIL and DaeshAlthough I think it's also important to recognize that the kinds of airstrikes that they're carrying out—just like the kinds of airstrikes that we're carrying out—in and of themselves are not sufficient And the work that we do to bolster local fighting forces, the cutting off of supply lines, financing, oil, reducing the flow of foreign fighters, the intelligence work that needs to be done—all of that is something that we are doing now and that they can supplementBut that's going to be a process that involves hard, methodical work It's not going to be something that happens just because suddenly we take a few more airstrikes And that's the kind of hard work that I know France is prepared to do, the United States is prepared to do, and perhaps, in the future, Russia will be as well Okay?Thank you very much, everybody", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Given the current congressional stalemate surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are you considering alternative strategies to ensure its passage, particularly in light of the recent agreements with Boeing and GE in Vietnam? Furthermore, what are your views on amending the agreement to address concerns regarding currency manipulation? [SEP] Look, I've been around long enough to know that trade deals are always a tough sell. Everyone's looking for a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. And in an election year, you can bet some folks will try to score political points. That being said, I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do. It's good for America, good for the region, good for the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for the U.S. Most countries here already sell their stuff to us with relatively low tariffs, while our goods face significantly higher tariffs there. So, a deal that eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in these markets is a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for exposing us to countries with lower wages and lax labor and environmental standards. But TPP includes enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and address environmental problems. This allows us to engage with countries like Vietnam on these issues. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will make us worse off. We'll demonstrably be better off. American workers and businesses will benefit. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements I inherited. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too, despite the bumps along the way. As for currency manipulation, TPP includes provisions for transparency and reporting. Some argue for enforceable provisions allowing us to impose tariffs if currency is devalued. But it's hard to determine when currency is being manipulated. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. We've strengthened provisions to put folks on notice if we think they're engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, regarding the Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, his death has been confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This doesn't represent a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself. However, when a high-profile leader consistently targets U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, it's my responsibility to protect our people. That's the message we've sent.", "label": "General"}

[SEP] The only individuals to whom such comparisons can be fairly attributed are those who make them. The Mexican Congress is functioning normally, with a responsible attitude displayed by the majority of political parties represented there. Members from the PRI, PAN, the Green Party, the New Alliance, and other political parties are working diligently. I simply deplore this behavior, which only serves to damage the image of those responsible and further undermine the presence of Mexican parties as significant as the PRD, which, in addition to their own internal challenges, are losing public confidence due to the actions of individuals who simply make them appear foolish. I am hopeful that our institutional life will be strengthened and that we will enhance dialogue and the capacity for communication among ourselves.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, would direct talks between the United States and Iran and Syria help stem the violence in Iraq? And would you agree to such a step?

And if that's what they think they ought to do, that's fine. I hope their talks yield results. One result that Iraq would like to see is for the Iranians to leave them alone. If Iran is going to be involved in their country, they ought to be involved in a constructive way, encouraging peace. That is the message that the Iranians—the Iraqis have delivered to the Iranians. That's the message that Prime Minister Maliki has made clear, that he expects the neighbors to encourage peaceful development of the country.As far as the United States goes, Iran knows how to get to the table with us, and that is to do that which they said they would do, which is verifiably suspend their enrichment programs. One of the concerns that I have about the Iranian regime is their desire to develop a nuclear weapon, and you ought to be concerned about it too. The idea of this regime having a nuclear weapon by which they could blackmail the world is unacceptable to free nations. And that's why we're working through the United Nations to send a clear message that the EU-3 and the United States, Russia, and China do not accept their desires to have a nuclear weapon.There is a better way forward for the Iranian people. And if they would like to be at the table discussing this issue with the United States, I have made it abundantly clear how they can do so, and that is, verifiably suspend the enrichment program. And then we'll be happy to have a dialog with them.But as far as Iraq goes, the Iraqi Government is a sovereign government that is capable of handling its own foreign policies and is in the process of doing so.

The speed of the transfer depends on our commanding officers' assessment that the initial mission phase is complete. Our primary goal is neutralizing Libyan air defenses to ensure a no-fly zone's effectiveness and the safety of coalition aircraft. Secondly, we're focused on the humanitarian aspects of the mission. We anticipate this transition within days, not weeks. The Pentagon will keep the public and press informed. NATO will coordinate due to its capabilities. Admiral Mullen can provide specifics on the transfer process. As for the partnership, I don't want to give away my speech's highlights. Chile offers us as much as we offer them. Their clean energy work is impressive, leading to a clean energy partnership. We're strong in alternative energy, but Chile's initiatives might benefit us. On education, we want American students to look outward, hence an exchange program with the Americas. Security cooperation: We can learn from Colombia's success against narcotraffickers and apply those lessons to Central America. Collaboration with Chile and Colombia can enhance security training in Central America. This partnership is a two-way street, not just a developed country helping a poor one. Chile is a rising regional power collaborating with us for peace and prosperity. We lag in the Americas' integration compared to Europe's post-war unity. Latin America needs to fulfill its potential. We share much with the U.S.: territory, hardworking people, and fewer conflicts. We aim for a Partnership 2.0, sharing responsibilities and values. It should encompass democracy, freedom, rule of law, human rights, free trade, education, science, and technology. We can learn from the U.S.'s innovation.

We have a framework agreement with Iran and the P5+1. Some aspects are very specific, like the reduction of centrifuges at Natanz. Other aspects are more about intent. The details matter. How those details are interpreted will be subject to negotiation. It's inaccurate to suggest that everything is done. This framework, if implemented, will ensure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. The details are important, and there will be tough negotiations. I said this from the beginning. There's no contradiction. Even with the interim agreement, there was back-and-forth. But we achieved something substantial that was effective, even according to critics like the Israelis. They said it worked. Now they are suggesting we stay here. On Cuba, we didn't get into that level of detail. The state sponsor of terrorism recommendation will come to me. I will review it. Congress will have an opportunity to review it as well.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you recently met with Prime Minister Najib, who is currently facing allegations of corruption and human rights violations. During your town hall meeting, you stated that you would raise these issues with him privately. Could you elaborate on the specific message you conveyed to Prime Minister Najib regarding the investment funds scandal and the imprisonment of his political opponents? [SEP] With regard to the refugee program, the recent events in Paris, which occurred just a week ago, remain fresh in our minds. Given the rapid pace of news dissemination, it is easy to lose sight of significant events. However, the recent attacks in Paris, coupled with the similarities between Paris and numerous American cities, have understandably heightened public concern, leading to the swift passage of legislation in the House. It is my hope that, with a period of reflection, the public will recognize that refugees seeking entry into the United States undergo the most rigorous and thorough vetting process imaginable. This process, which has been refined over several administrations on a bipartisan basis, is exceptionally comprehensive and typically requires between 18 and 24 months for approval. While the House legislation may appear straightforward on its face, its practical effect could be to paralyze the system and prevent the admission of refugees. The imposition of additional layers of bureaucracy that do not enhance security but merely render processing nearly impossible would effectively terminate the refugee program for those who desperately require it. My reference to a betrayal of our values was specifically directed at commentary suggesting that we might prioritize the admission of Christians over Muslims or expressing the unfounded fear that a four-year-old orphan might pose a threat. Those of you who accompanied me to the refugee center witnessed these children firsthand. If you are a parent and you observed their plight, you would undoubtedly agree that we must find a place for them within the United States. To deny them refuge would be a violation of our fundamental principles. Fortunately, the vast majority of the public, aware of the extensive screening measures already in place, would concur that we must uphold our moral obligation to these children. Turning to the matter of Prime Minister Najib, it is my policy not to comment on ongoing investigations, whether they are conducted within the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. However, I did emphasize to Prime Minister Najib, as I have done with numerous other leaders, the paramount importance of transparency, accountability, and the eradication of corruption, all of which are essential prerequisites for sustainable development. I also underscored the significance of civil society and a free press. While nations exist at varying stages of development, certain fundamental principles are universally applicable. The recent historic election in Myanmar serves as a testament to the potential for progress. While Myanmar may not immediately mirror the democratic practices of Sweden, a profound transformation is underway, and it is our duty to encourage and support this evolution. Our efforts, through initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership and the incorporation of transparency provisions in trade agreements like the TPP, are designed to raise the bar and promote higher standards of governance. While progress may be uneven, the overarching trajectory is towards a world where individuals are treated with fairness, the rule of law is upheld, governments are accountable, and all voices are heard. These values are not merely American values; they are universal values that should be embraced by all nations. Thank you.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Q. I'd like to ask you a question first, Mr. President. Et ensuite une au President de la Republique.Interpreter. I'm going to question the President of the Republic. Q. President Bush, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki says that talks on a status of forces agreement are at an impasse, or a dead end—not dead, but in trouble. How do you break this impasse, and are the conditions that the United States have set forward in support so far nonnegotiable?[At this point, the reporter asked a question in French, and it was translated as follows.] Q. And to you, President, is the Franco-American relationship the privilege, the priority number-one relationship in the transatlantic context? [SEP] Olivier, if I were a betting man, we'll reach an agreement with the Iraqis. And it's—you know, of course we're there at their invitation; this is a sovereign nation. And therefore, we're working hard with the elected Government of Iraq about, you know, U.S. presence and coalition presence in a way that the elected Government is comfortable.And it's interesting to be in—working with a democracy where, you know, people are trying to prepare the ground to get something passed through Parliament, for example, or the free press is vibrant. But we're going to work hard to accommodate their desires. It's their country.And at the same time, we believe that a strategic relationship with Iraq is important. It's important for Iraq; it's important for the United States; it's important for the region. And I repeat to you that whatever we agreed to, it will not commit future Presidents to troop levels, nor will it establish permanent bases.Anyway, we'll see how it goes. And thanks for the question in English. [] Well, the Americans and the French have had a privileged relationship for two centuries now. I mean, when the United States of America was born, France made a choice. It was not a European choice, because we chose to side with the Americans or the United States of America as opposed to Britain at the time. And in two World Wars, we've been together. We share the same values.So yes, it is a privileged relationship, but it's not privileged since I came to be elected; it's been privileged for two centuries now. You can't neglect that. Now, through this—throughout that, we have had ups and downs—hiccups—because two peoples— I'm talking about the French and the American peoples—that actually resemble one another. We express our feelings. The American people can be heard, and likewise for the French people. We have to be careful about this. We have to be mindful of this when we talk to one another in our relations.I have always seen American leaders— and thank you to President Bush—for accepting European originality and independence and, of course, French originality and independence. And I've always noted that we can talk very frankly when we had points of disagreement. But we have to do so in—as allies and as friends, and be mindful of not hurting one another. We can agree on an issue, on the substance of issue, but we don't have to say so in an unpleasant manner. It so happens that today we have a lot of areas of convergence. But yes, maybe on such and such an issue, we don't totally agree, but it doesn't in any way undermine the basis of what I have to say, which is that the Americans are our friends and our allies. They know they can count on us.Might I add that it seems to me that the more you trust somebody, the more trust there is on both sides of the Atlantic, the more leeway we have. We don't ask the United States to apologize to us because they have their own vision of their strategic interests, and they don't ask us to apologize for the fact that we are defending our own strategic interests, precisely because the relationship is a strong one; it is a calm one. And when a relationship is that strong, you accept one's divergences or differences. And that is my whole point. You've got to understand, if you're in a strong relationship, then you have more room for freedom, more room for maneuver. That's what this is all about.Perhaps one last question? Oh.

You know, it's sort of interesting—we've listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven't always agreed with him, and it's, I think, pretty standard. That's okay. He did not want us to ban our—this—this—put up the ban to China, when China was heavily infected—very badly, Wuhan. He didn't want to do that, and I did. And other things. And he told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but it's—you know, I think it's fact that I banned—I did the ban on Europe. But I get along with him very well and I agree with a lot of what he's said.So—you know, it's interesting: He's got a very good approval rating, and I like that. I—it's good. Because remember, he's working for this administration. He's working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn't have to be Dr. Fauci. He's working with our administration. And, for the most part, we've done pretty much what he and others—Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific—recommended.And he's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect—and the administration, with respect to the virus? We should have a very high, because what we've done in terms of—we're just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody has seen, and the testing at 55 million tests; we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I'd love to show you—perhaps you've seen it—where we're up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that's just a tiny fraction of what we've done, in terms of testing.So it sort of is curious: A man works for us—with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, dozens of American troops have been killed this month, and sectarian violence appears to be rising again in Iraq. And you yourself just said that you're expecting more casualties in the weeks and months ahead. How much longer do you believe you can sustain your current policy in Iraq without significant progress on the ground? And how confident are you about finding those missing soldiers? [SEP] I'm confident that the military is doing everything it can to find the missing soldiers. I talked to General Petraeus about this subject and Secretary Gates. And General Petraeus informs him that we're using all the intelligence and all the troops we can find—to find them. It's a top priority of our people there in Iraq.Obviously, the loss of life is—it is devastating to families. I fully understand that. But I want to remind you as to why I sent more troops in. It was to help stabilize the capital. You're asking me, How much longer? We have yet to even get all our troops in place. General David Petraeus laid out a plan for the Congress. He talked about a strategy all aiming—all aimed at helping this Iraqi Government secure its capital so that they can do the—some of the political work necessary, the hard work necessary to reconcile.And as I explained in my opening remarks, all the troops won't be there until mid-June. And one reason you're seeing more fighting is because our troops are going into new areas, along with the Iraqis. And so General Petraeus has said, Why don't you give us until September, and let me report back, to not only me but to the United States Congress, about progress?I would like to see us in a different configuration at some point in time in Iraq. However, it's going to require taking control of the capital. And the best way to do that was to follow the recommendations of General Petraeus. As I have constantly made clear, the recommendations of Baker-Hamilton appeal to me, and that is to be embedded and to train and to guard the territorial integrity of the country and to have Special Forces to chase down Al Qaida. But I didn't think we could get there unless we increased the troop levels to secure the capital. I was fearful that violence would spiral out of control in Iraq and that this experience of trying to help this democracy would—couldn't succeed.And so therefore, the decisions I made are all aimed at getting us to a different position; and the timing of which will be decided by the commanders on the ground, not politicians here in Washington.Chen [Edwin Chen, Los Angeles Times].

The Paris climate negotiations need Brazil's leadership. Their renewable energy commitments demonstrate this. Brazil is a major global player. I told President Dilma last night that the U.S., despite its power, can't solve global issues alone. Global health requires Brazil's partnership to prevent pandemics. Climate change, terrorism, poverty – all require Brazil's involvement. They are an indispensable partner.I have an excellent relationship with President Dilma. I trust her completely.

We share common values, strong people-to-people relations, and similar histories.

A great country overcomes difficulties. This applies to nations, individuals, and everything in life: the courage to overcome challenges and uphold commitments to one's people and country.It also applies to relations with countries like the U.S. Brazil and the U.S. have much in common. We both fought to overcome slavery. We have large Black populations and multicultural societies. These are major assets.We are also strong democracies.

We'll do so decisively, with a strong sense of commitment.We will not only resume growth but also ensure the continuity of the gains we have established in the past 12 years.

We'll reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner to discuss their agenda. Hopefully, we can find common ground. The message from this election, and others, is clear: get things done. Focus on the concerns of ordinary Americans. Think about the single mom struggling with childcare costs, the young person worried about college debt, the construction worker who needs a job.

We need to cut taxes for the middle class, assist small businesses in hiring veterans, and support teachers. In Hawaii, budget constraints force schools to operate only four days a week.

When people analyze the situation, there will be—this problem started before my Presidency; it obviously took place during my Presidency. The question facing a President is not when the problem started, but what did you do about it when you recognized the problem? And I readily concede I chucked aside some of my free market principles when I was told by chief economic advisers that the situation we were facing could be worse than the Great Depression.So I've told some of my friends who said—you know, who have taken an ideological position on this issue—why did you do what you did? I said, well, if you were sitting there and heard that the depression could be greater than the Great Depression, I hope you would act too, which I did. And we've taken extraordinary measures to deal with the frozen credit markets, which have affected the economy. Credit spreads are beginning to shrink; lending is just beginning to pick up. The actions we have taken, I believe, have helped thaw the credit markets, which is the first step toward recovery.And so yes, look, there's plenty of critics in this business, I understand that. And I thank you for giving me a chance to defend a record that I am going to continue to defend, because I think it's a good, strong record.Jim [Jim Axelrod, CBS News].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace? [SEP] Well, first of all, on TPP, Angel, I haven't been around as long as Senators Cooper or Secretary Kerry, but I've spent enough time in the Senate to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal. And especially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it.Having said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done. And the reason I'm confident is because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let me reiterate: This is the fastest growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market for the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In other words, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest growing markets of the world, that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers.Number two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulations. Well, if you're signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice, to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts, the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries.So I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. And I'm confident we will get it passed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korean free trade agreement or the Colombian and Panamanian free trade agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although it will—there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way.With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not something that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way. But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations.Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them.On the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people. And that's exactly the message that has been sent. President ung. Let me respond to this question concerning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is a significant trade and economic linkage, contributing to sustaining the dynamics and the role as driver for economic growth in our country, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. And for Vietnam, TPP and Vietnam's participation in TPP is one step undertaken by the Vietnamese Government in our process of extensive international integration President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting translation Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Can you hear, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I'm sure that he was saying something very wise and important, and we wanted to make sure that we all heard it. President ung. So I would like to add that Vietnam, together with other TPP countries, have been making efforts to narrow differences, to promote cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness and understanding and paying attention to one another's legitimate interests. And the finalization of TPP is also the successful outcomes of all 12 members of the TPP, rather than any individual effort. And we are prepared to ratify TPP, and we stand ready to implement all the commitments under TPP.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. So you rule out that she was fired? [SEP] I'm--come on, Jackie, I don't know. I'm telling you the--I found out about it this morning, so I don't yet know the circumstances, and Ken Salazar's been in testimony on the Hill.With respect to your first question, at MMS, Ken Salazar was in the process of making these reforms. But the point that I'm making is, is that obviously they weren't happening fast enough. If they had been happening fast enough, this might have been caught. Now, it's possible that it might not have been caught. All right? I mean, we could have gone through a whole new process for environmental review; you could have had a bunch of technical folks take a look at BP's plans, and they might have said, this is--meets industry standards, we haven't had an accident like this in 15 years, and we should go ahead.That's what this Commission has to discover, is, was this a systemic breakdown? Is this something that could happen once in a million times? Is it something that could happen once in a thousand times or once every 5,000 times? What exactly are the risks involved?Now, let me make one broader point, though, about energy. The fact that oil companies now have to go a mile underwater and then drill another 3 miles below that in order to hit oil tells us something about the direction of the oil industry. Extraction is more expensive, and it is going to be inherently more risky.And so that's part of the reason you never heard me say, Drill, baby, drill, because we can't drill our way out of the problem. It may be part of the mix as a bridge to a transition to new technologies and new energy sources, but we should be pretty modest in understanding that the easily accessible oil is already been sucked up out of the ground.And as we are moving forward, the technology gets more complicated, the oil sources are more remote, and that means that there's probably going to end up being more risk. And we as a society are going to have to make some very serious determinations in terms of what risks are we willing to accept. And that's part of what the Commission, I think, has to--is going to have to look at.I will tell you, though, that understanding we need to grow--we--we're going to be consuming oil in terms--for our industries and for how people live in this country, we're going to have to start moving on this transition. And that's why when I went to the Republican caucus just this week, I said to them, let's work together. You've got Lieberman and Kerry, who previously were working with Lindsey Graham--even though Lindsey's not on the bill right now--coming up with a framework that has the potential to get bipartisan support and says, yes, we're going to still need oil production, but you know what, we can see what's out there on the horizon, and it's a problem if we don't start changing how we operate.

What's worse: that the Government knew or that the Government didn't know? But the point I made in my initial speech in the White House about Iraq was, is that we know they're there, and we're going to protect our troops. When we find the networks that are enabling these weapons to end up in Iraq, we will deal with them. If we find agents who are moving these devices into Iraq, we will deal with them. I have put out the command to our troops—I mean, to the people who are commanders that we'll protect the people—the soldiers of the United States and innocent people in Iraq and will continue doing so.Now, let me step back on itself.

Kabul, containing a large proportion of the Afghan population, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time, and they've done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were. That doesn't mean these events won't take place, probably for some time. Our work is not done. But as I said, the tide of war is receding. We've shifted to a transition phase. Much like Iraq, where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder coming out by year's end, and Iraq has maintained a democratic government and tamped down violence, we think a similar approach makes sense.

The European situation is multifaceted. Some nations had irresponsible fiscal policies and public debt.

Is there anything more you can do for those affected, and how would you view your term ending without achieving your immigration goals? [SEP] On Ukraine, Russia, and Minsk, there's a strong consensus that we must keep pressing Russia to adhere to the Minsk agreement. We need to continue supporting Ukraine in meeting its obligations under Minsk. Until that's done, sanctions remain. There was discussion about potential additional steps if Russia, through separatists, escalates aggression in Ukraine. These discussions are at a technical level, not yet political, as the immediate goal is rolling over existing sanctions at the upcoming European Council meeting. However, we want to be prepared technically. Our hope is that we won't need further steps because the Minsk agreement is fulfilled. I commend Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande for their extraordinary persistence in trying to make that happen. Ultimately, this rests with Mr. Putin. He must decide: Does he continue to harm his country's economy and isolate Russia by pursuing a misguided desire to recreate the Soviet empire, or does he recognize that Russia's greatness doesn't depend on violating other countries' sovereignty? The Russian people are bearing severe costs. This may not be understood due to state media propaganda, but the truth is that the Russian people would greatly benefit from a different approach. Ironically, Mr. Putin claimed his incursions into Ukraine were to protect Russian speakers, yet they are the ones suffering the most. Their economy has collapsed, their lives are disrupted, many are displaced, and their homes may be destroyed. The best way to end their suffering is full implementation of the Minsk agreement. On immigration, I'm frustrated by the district court ruling currently under appeal. We're aggressively pursuing the appeal and implementing the unchallenged parts of the executive actions. A key provision for me was enabling undocumented individuals to undergo background checks, pay back taxes, and gain legal status. This requires a significant administrative apparatus. I decided it's best not to accept applications until the legal status is clarified. I firmly believe this is within my legal authority, and our lawyers agree. The executive branch has traditional discretion in applying immigration laws. However, the U.S. is a government of laws and separations of power, so we must challenge the ruling, even if it's from a single district court judge. Until we have clarity, I don't want to bring people in and have them jump through hoops only to face further delays. Of course, Congress could solve this by acting, obviating the need for executive actions. Most Americans want this to happen. I suspect it will be a major topic in the next Presidential campaign. We'll continue pushing on all fronts to fix the broken system. Administratively, we'll be prepared if we get the ruling we believe we deserve.

[SEP] I knew you'd probably try to get me to start negotiating with myself. I haven't even visited with Congresswoman Pelosi yet. She's coming to the Oval Office later this week. I'm going to sit down and talk with her. I believe on a lot of issues we can find common ground, and there's a significant difference between common ground and abandoning principle. She's not going to abandon her principles, and I'm not going to abandon mine. But I do believe we have an opportunity to find some common ground to move forward on.In that very same interview you quoted, one of these three characters asked me about minimum wage.

But I really feel confident. I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people, and he has that opportunity. And he won't have that opportunity again. It's never going to be there again.So I really believe that he's going to do something very positive for his people, for himself, his family. He's got an opportunity, the likes of which I think almost—if you look into history—very few people have ever had. He can take that nation, with those great people, and truly make it great. So it's a one-time—it's a one-time shot. And I think it's going to work out very well.That's why I feel positive, because it makes so much sense. And we will watch over, and we'll protect, and we'll do a lot of things. I can say that South Korea, Japan, China, many countries want to see it happen. And they'll help. They'll all help.

I want a fair, transparent relationship based on clear rules. We've been working to strengthen alliances globally for stability. This trip was about fostering cooperation with India, Vietnam, etc. It's not isolating China; it's creating a stable Indo-Pacific base. The Quad is about maintaining stability, not isolating China.

Unable to even think about it. And I said: Nope, I want to go. I insist on going. It would have taken us forever.The Paris police said, Please, you can't do this.

Don't you think that NATO should act unanimously in this respect and Germany, as the strongest European NATO partner, should also deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine? And Ukraine has asked Germany to do so.And on Nord Stream 2, I would also like to ask: Don't you think, with regard to the threat posed by Russia, Germany should already rethink its position on Nord Stream 2?And the third question, if I may: Over the last few days and weeks, there has been severe criticism from the U.S. media and from Congress as well vis-à-vis Germany about the reliability of Germany as an ally. This has been called into question. Do you understand this criticism? Is Germany a reliable partner, from your point of view?And, Mr. Chancellor, also a question to you: Nord Stream 2—you said all options are on the table. You're not mentioning Nord Stream 2 by name. Don't you think if you were to spell this out, you could win back trust as a strong ally here for the U.S.? [SEP] There's no need to win back trust. He has the complete trust of the United States. Germany is our—one of our most important allies in the world. There is no doubt about Germany's partnership with the United States. None.With regard to helping Ukraine, one of the largest contributors financially to Ukraine has been Germany. Germany has been in the forefront of making sure—providing economic assistance.You also asked the question—you asked so many, I can't remember them all. But in terms of the U.S. media saying Germany is not reliable, Germany is completely reliable—completely, totally, thoroughly reliable. I have no doubt about Germany at all. We are united. And the transatlantic partnership between Germany and the U.S. is one of the permanent pillars of German policy, and it will be relevant in the future as well—just as relevant. And this will be one of our top priorities always.On behalf of NATO, we are the country in continental Europe that is doing—making the largest contribution: financial means and also military power. And we are the country that contributes a great share—we're not fully—we don't fully agree with you as who pays the biggest part of financial support to Ukraine. And so, since 2014, about 2 billion U.S. dollars direct bilateral support and, within the EU, an additional 3.8 billion that is made available. So a substantial financial means to stabilize the Ukrainian economy, and we are willing to continue with that sort of contribution.So this is the very strong and unbreakable friendship between our two countries.

How can you reopen the government, if even the Vice President is self-isolating? And why hasn't testing gotten up to the point where every American who wants to test can get a test?

But let me stress this: permanent bases should not be seen as a provocation leading to increased Russian activity and militarization. Russia has been steadily militarizing areas like Kaliningrad for years. From Georgia in 2008 to the illegal annexation of Crimea, their actions speak volumes. The U.S. presence is a security guarantee for our part of Europe, for the free world. We desire both U.S. and NATO forces to protect our interests. The President and his team will weigh all factors, but the arguments for a U.S. presence are strong, given the ongoing violations of international law. Deterrence is key to preventing war.

He believes wealthy nations should contribute to their defense, a point he's made repeatedly within NATO, resulting in increased contributions.

And the idea that we lurch from crisis to crisis and, every 6 months or every 9 months, that we threaten not to pay our bills on stuff we've already bought and default and ruin the full faith and credit of the United States of America, that's not how you run a great country.So I've put forward a very clear principle: I will not negotiate around the debt ceiling. We're not going to play the same game that we saw happen in 2011, which was hugely destructive, hurt our economy, provided more uncertainty to the business community than anything else that happened.And I'm not alone in this. If you go to Wall Street, including talking to a whole bunch of folks who spent a lot of money trying to beat me, they would say it would be disastrous for us to use the debt ceiling as a cudgel to try to win political points on Capitol Hill.So we're not going to do that, and—which is why I think that part of what I hope over the next couple of days we see is a recognition that there is a way to go ahead and get what it is that you've been fighting for. These guys have been fighting for spending cuts. They can get some very meaningful spending cuts. This would amount to $2 trillion—$2 trillion—in spending cuts over the last couple of years. And in exchange, they're getting a little over a trillion dollars in revenue.

[SEP] Well first of all you know I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well.When we have a deal with China—or not—but when we have a deal with China—because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury. Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way.But when—and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.So I will say though that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal.And in the meantime as you know I did tariff relief with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia. And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally and we work very well together.But you—your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well. That's true. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing—large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well.Please. Thanks. Mr. President Australia is in its 29th year of consecutive economic growth which is an extraordinary national achievement. And we will continue to grow as our most recent national accounts demonstrated.Australia is also very used to dealing with a complex and changing world. And that's why we've diversified our trade base and have been doing that for many years. I mean 6 years ago when our government came to office 27 percent of our trade was covered by agreements around the world. That figure is now 70 percent and we're going to take that to 90 percent. And that's important. And that's opening up opportunities.So there are ebbs and flows that go in the global economy and Australia has built up a resilience through the broad-based nature in which we're taking our economy to the world. I mean Australia has never got rich selling things to itself. And we've always had an outward looking perspective when it comes to engaging our economic opportunities.And a big part of what we've been discussing here is some new opportunities whether it's in the rare earth metals the critical minerals the frontier technologies space. You know this is where jobs are going to be in the future as well. And so we will deal with those ebbs and flows as they come.But the President is right: The arrangement they will come to—and I'm confident they will—with China will be one that will set you know a new bar in terms of how China's economy then deals with a lot of these complicated issues in the future with developed economies like Australia. So we look on with interest. And I think ultimately when we arrive at that point it's going to put global trade on a stronger footing. And Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things.And they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it clean coal but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to—because it was very dangerous years ago and very bad for a lot of people.

We must prioritize eliminating methane and addressing other pressing issues. Although it may seem inconsistent to advocate for increased oil production while simultaneously championing emissions reductions, it's not, because we cannot eliminate fossil fuels overnight.

{"sentence": "Q. It will be over soon. Thank you, Mr. President. There have been several developments in Syria that I wanted to ask you about, starting with Russia's involvement. You met with President Putin earlier this week, and I wonder if you think he was honest with you about his intentions in Syria. If Russia is targeting groups beyond the Islamic State, including U.S.-aligned groups, does the U.S. military have an obligation to protect them? And in—on the situation in Syria more broadly, there have obviously been failures in the U.S. train-and-equip program. Do you believe that that program can be fixed, or do you have to look at other options? Would you, in particular, be willing to reconsider a no-fly zone, which several Presidential candidates, including your former Secretary of State, are now calling for? [SEP] Yes Well, first and foremost, let's understand what's happening in Syria and how we got here What started off as peaceful protests against Asad, the President, evolved into a civil war because Asad met those protests with unimaginable brutality And so this is not a conflict between the United States and any party in Syria; this is a conflict between the Syrian people and a brutal, ruthless dictatorPoint number two is that the reason Asad is still in power is because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process And in that sense, what Russia is doing now is not particularly different from what they had been doing in the past They're just more overt about it They have been propping up a regime that is rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Syrian population because they've seen that he has been willing to drop barrel bombs on children and on villages indiscriminately and has been more concerned about clinging to power than the state of his countrySo in my discussions with President Putin, I was very clear that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is to have a political transition that is inclusive—that keeps the State intact, that keeps the military intact, that maintains cohesion, but that is inclusive—and the only way to accomplish that is for Mr Asad to transition, because you cannot rehabilitate him in the eyes of Syrians This is not a judgment I'm making, it is a judgment that the overwhelming majority of Syrians makeAnd I said to Mr Putin that I'd be prepared to work with him if he is willing to broker with his partners, Mr Asad and Iran, a political transition—we can bring the rest of the world community to a brokered solution—but that a military solution alone, an attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Asad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire And it won't work And they will be there for a while if they don't take a different courseI also said to him that it is true that the United States and Russia and the entire world have a common interest in destroying ISIL But what was very clear—and regardless of what Mr Putin said—was that he doesn't distinguish between ISIL and a moderate Sunni opposition that wants to see Mr Asad go From their perspective, they're all terrorists And that's a recipe for disaster, and it's one that I rejectSo where we are now is that we are having technical conversations about deconfliction so that we're not seeing US and American [Russian; White House correction] firefights in the air But beyond that, we're very clear in sticking to our belief and our policy that the problem here is Asad and the brutality that he has inflicted on the Syrian people and that it has to stop And in order for it to stop, we're prepared to work with all the parties concerned But we are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr Asad's behaviorKeep in mind also, from a practical perspective, the moderate opposition in Syria is one that if we're ever going to have to have a political transition, we need And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are debilitated—de-capacitated, and it's only strengthening ISIL And that's not good for anybodyIn terms of our support of opposition groups inside of Syria, I made very clear early on that the United States couldn't impose a military solution on Syria either, but that it was in our interest to make sure that we were engaged with moderate opposition inside of Syria, because eventually Syria will fall, the Asad regime will fall, and we have to have somebody who we're working with that we can help pick up the pieces and stitch back together a cohesive, coherent country And so we will continue to support themThe training-and-equip program was a specific initiative by the Defense Department to see if we could get some of that moderate opposition to focus attention on ISIL in the eastern portion of the country And I'm the first one to acknowledge it has not worked the way it was supposed to, Julie And I think that the Department of Defense would say the same thing And part of the reason, frankly, is because when we tried to get them to just focus on ISIL, the response we'd get back is, how can we focus on ISIL when every single day we're having barrel bombs and attacks from the regime? And so it's been hard to get them to reprioritize, looking east, when they've got bombs coming at them from the westSo what we're doing with the train-and-equip is looking at where we have had success—for example, working with some of the Kurdish community in the east that pushed ISIL out—seeing if we can build on that But what we're also going to continue to do is to have contacts with and work with opposition that rightly believes, in the absence of some change of government inside of Syria we're going to continue to see civil war, and that is going to turbocharge ISIL recruitment and jihadist recruitment, and we're going to continue to have problemsNow, last point I just want to make about this, because sometimes, the conversation here in the Beltway differs from the conversation internationally: Mr Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength, but out of weakness, because his client, Mr Asad, was crumbling And it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money; now he's got to put in his own planes and his own pilots And the notion that he put forward a plan and that somehow the international community sees that as viable because there is a vacuum there, I didn't see, after he made that speech in the United Nations, suddenly, the 60-nation coalition that we have start lining up behind himIran and Asad make up Mr Putin's coalition at the moment The rest of the world makes up ours So I don't think people are fooled by the current strategy It does not mean that we could not see Mr Putin begin to recognize that it is in their interests to broker a political settlement And as I said in New York, we're prepared to work with the Russians and the Iranians, as well as our partners who are part of the anti-ISIL coalition, to come up with that political transition And nobody pretends that it's going to be easy, but I think it is still possible And so we will maintain lines of communicationBut we are not going to be able to get those negotiations going if there is not a recognition that there's got to be a change in government We're not going to go back to the status quo ante And the kinds of airstrikes against moderate opposition that Russia is engaging in is going to be counterproductive It's going to move us farther away rather than towards the ultimate solution that we're all—that we all should be looking for", "label": "Implicit"}

It won't significantly impact U.S. gas prices, despite what people think. It's great for Canadian companies, not so much for American consumers. Construction jobs are temporary, and refining jobs are limited. We could create far more jobs rebuilding our infrastructure. I want to ensure it doesn't worsen climate change, which has real costs. We see that with flooding, wildfires, and drought. A Nebraska judge is still reviewing the route. People hype this as a magic bullet, but it's hard to see where they get that idea.

{"sentence": "Given the significant drop in housing starts, how concerned are you that this housing recession will negatively impact the broader economy, and what additional measures can be taken to prevent such a spillover?

However, I acknowledge the softness in the housing market. Our GDP growth is driven by exports, indicating positive aspects of our economy. The key question is how to help homeowners. I don't support bailouts for lenders, but we need policies to help people stay in their homes. The FHA modernization bill is crucial for expanding the FHA's reach and assisting more people in refinancing. The securitization of mortgages has created challenges in finding someone to help with refinancing. We need to help people understand their mortgages and facilitate refinancing. Secretary Paulson and Secretary Jackson are working with the private sector to address this. Additionally, we need to change the tax laws to remove the tax liability associated with refinancing.

Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable. That doesn't mean these events won't happen; they probably will for some time. Our work isn't done. But as I said, the war is receding. We've shifted to a transition phase, like in Iraq, where we drew down our troops, and Iraq maintained a democratic government and reduced violence. We think a similar approach makes sense. Even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack. These countries are digging themselves out of war and conflict; they're dangerous places.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the recent energy legislation and your administration's stance on California's emission standards, could you clarify the apparent discrepancy? How do you justify promoting a national strategy while simultaneously hindering state-level initiatives? Furthermore, can you provide specific details regarding your discussions with Vice President Gore on climate change mitigation strategies, particularly concerning innovative technologies and international cooperation? [SEP] Well, look, let's get a few things straight. The question is, what's the most effective way to tackle this problem? Is it better to have each state doing its own thing, or should we have a unified national strategy? Director Johnson made a decision based on the legislation we passed, which allows us to have a national strategy. We're increasing CAFE standards to 35 miles an hour by 2020, and we're significantly increasing alternative fuels to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The Director, in assessing this law, decided that we now have a national plan. That's one of the benefits of Congress passing this piece of legislation.I told Vice President Gore that I take the issue seriously, and we're developing a strategy that will deal with it—an effective strategy. Yesterday's bill is a part of that strategy. When you replace as much gasoline on a mandatory basis as we're suggesting, it's going to do a lot to improve greenhouse gases. By the way, the bill I signed was a little weaker than the one I suggested, but I was still happy to sign it.One of the key components to being successful on reformulated fuel standards is to spend research and development money on cellulosic ethanol, new ways to manufacture ethanol. We can't rely only on corn to meet these standards. I understand that a lot of people in the farm belt are getting concerned, unless, of course, you're a corn grower. But if you're feeding cattle or feeding hogs, the cost of business has gone up. That's one of the trade-offs you have to make. So I want to assure people out there that we're spending a lot of taxpayer money in a way to figure out how to use wood chips or switchgrass to make ethanol. But this is a real national plan.Secondly, in order to be effective on a global basis, countries that emit greenhouse gases need to be at the table. One of the main reasons I was against Kyoto was that China wasn't at the table. We could do all we wanted to do, but it wouldn't affect greenhouse gases over the long run unless a country like China had agreed to participate in a strategy.So we went to the Bali Conference with that in mind and worked out a compromise that said we're committed to a process that's going to unfold over the next two years. But we've also got a parallel process working to make sure major emitters sit at the table and come together, hopefully, on a goal that we all agree to. It's a strategy that I laid out at the G-8 in Germany, it's a strategy that was explained to everybody there in Bali, and it's a strategy we think will be effective.I absolutely take the issue seriously. But I want to make sure that we're effective in what we do, and secondly, do not wreck our economy in whatever we do. See, it is hard to develop the technologies necessary to be able to make sure our standard of living remains strong and deal with greenhouse gases if you're broke. If you don't have any money, it is really hard to develop new technologies. So we need to be prosperous for a lot of reasons, primarily so our citizens can have a good life, but also so that we're wealthy enough to make the investments necessary to deal with greenhouse gases.Finally, if you're truly serious about dealing with greenhouse gases, then it seems like to me you ought to be a strong supporter of nuclear power. Nuclear power enables us to generate electricity without emitting one unit of greenhouse gases. I am—to me, I am amazed that our country isn't more robust in supporting the advent of nuclear power. I certainly am, and applaud those efforts by Members of the Congress to provide incentives for the construction of new plants.But if you're somebody that says, Greenhouse gases are of vital national interest, then you ought to be saying, I'm for the development of nuclear power-plants. It is by far the best solution to making sure we have economic growth and, at the same time, be good stewards of the environment.And so when you couple increasing CAFE standards with using alternative fuels—which deals with the automobile area—as well as a good strategy on electricity, then all of a sudden, you begin to see a strategy unfold. And by the way, the final thing is, is that we do have 250 years of coal. And I believe we can develop technologies that will enable us to use that coal in an environmentally friendly way.So what I'm suggesting to you is, is that we do have a strategy. Our strategy is to bring others to the table. Our strategy is to develop our own plan to meet the national goals—the international goals that I hope we'll be able to set later on this summer. And you've just heard some of the components of it.Yes, sir.", "label": "General"}

We can work things out. The goal is for the U.S. and Europe to have independent supply chains. There are tweaks we can make to help European countries participate. The intention was never to exclude those cooperating with us. The aim was to prevent reliance on other countries, like when China restricted computer chip sales during the pandemic. We're back in business, and Europe will be too. We'll create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at Europe's expense.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, following your discussions with President Zelenskyy, what unique understanding did you derive from the in-person meeting that couldn't be achieved through virtual communication? Furthermore, did you discuss U.S. intelligence estimates concerning potential Russian escalation following the deployment of the Patriot missile system? [SEP] Allow me to address the initial part of your inquiry. As I often say, personal interaction is paramount. There's simply no replacement for engaging with someone face-to-face, whether they're an ally or an adversary. That's precisely what transpired today, and we'll continue this practice. With winter approaching, Putin is increasingly targeting civilian populations – women, children, and even orphanages. His actions are reprehensible, and ultimately, he will fail. He has already failed in his primary objective of conquering all of Ukraine, as the Ukrainian people will never accept his rule. It was crucial to demonstrate to the world that President Zelenskyy and I stand shoulder-to-shoulder. I evaluate leaders based on their words, their consistency, and their ability to maintain eye contact. President Zelenskyy embodies the values he espouses and is prepared to sacrifice everything for his nation. We are committed to providing him with unwavering support. Thank you.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, if I may, turning to the situation in Xinjiang, China. Your administration has implemented a limited ban on products from Xinjiang due to concerns about forced labor, but stopped short of a full regional ban. How do you respond to the Chinese Communist Party's claim that these allegations are false and that forced labor does not exist in Xinjiang? Furthermore, have any of our allies expressed interest in joining us in taking action against forced labor imposed by the Communist Party? [SEP] Yes, we're very concerned about that. We've been very firm on that issue. We're receiving reports. We should have a clearer picture in the next few days, and we'll decide on the appropriate course of action. Next question.

We're using all the tools at our disposal to defend ourselves. I can't go into specifics, but believe me, we're not taking this lightly. We're going to hold China accountable for their actions.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Q. As Islamic State loses territory, you and other officials have said that it is becoming a more traditional terrorist group. Are you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change?And secondly, given your comments this week about Donald Trump's volatility and lack of fitness to be President, are you concerned that he will be receiving security briefings about ISIS and other sensitive national security issues? [SEP] Okay. I'm never satisfied with our response, because if you're satisfied that means the problem is solved, and it's not. So we just spent a couple hours meeting with my top national security folks to look at what more can be done.It is absolutely necessary for us to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. It is not sufficient, but it is necessary. Because so long as they have those bases, they can use their propaganda to suggest that somehow there's still some caliphate being born, and that can insinuate itself then in the minds of folks who may be willing to travel there or carry out terrorist attacks. It's also destabilizing for countries in the region at a time when the region is already unstable.So I am pleased with the progress that we've made on the ground in Iraq and Syria. We're far from freeing Mosul and Raqqa. But what we've shown is, is that when it comes to conventional fights, ISIL can be beaten with partners on the ground so long as they've got the support from coalition forces that we've been providing.In the meantime, though, you're seeing ISIL carry out external terrorist acts, and they've learned something they've adapted from Al aida, which had a much more centralized operation and tried to plan very elaborate attacks. And what ISIL has figured out is that if they can convince a handful of people, or even one person, to carry out an attack on a subway or at a parade or some other public venue and kill scores of people, as opposed to thousands of people, it still creates the kinds of fear and concern that elevates their profile.So, in some ways, rooting out these networks for smaller, less complicated attacks is tougher, because it doesn't require as many resources on their part or preparation. But it does mean that we've got to do even more to generate the intelligence and to work with our partners in order to degrade those networks.And the fact is, is that those networks will probably sustain themselves even after ISIL is defeated in Raqqa and Mosul. But what we've learned from our efforts to defeat Al aida is that if we stay on it, our intelligence gets better, and we adapt as well. And eventually, we will dismantle these networks also.This is part of the reason why, however, it is so important for us to keep our eye on the ball and not panic, not succumb to fear. Because ISIL can't defeat the United States of America or our NATO partners. We can defeat ourselves, though, if we make bad decisions. And we have to understand that as painful and as tragic as these attacks are, that we are going to keep on grinding away, preventing them wherever we can, using a whole-of-Government effort to knock down their propaganda, to disrupt their networks, to take their key operatives off the battlefield, and that eventually, we will win.But if we start making bad decisions—indiscriminately killing civilians, for example, in some of these areas, instituting offensive religious tests on who can enter the country—those kinds of strategies can end up backfiring. Because in order for us to ultimately win this fight, we cannot frame this as a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam. That plays exactly into the hands of ISIL and the perversions—the perverse interpretations of Islam that they're putting forward.As far as Mr. Trump, we are going to go by the law, which is that—and in both tradition and the law—that if somebody is the nominee, the Republican nominee for President, they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared for this office.And I'm not going to go into details of the nature of the security briefings that both candidates receive. What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings. And if they want to be President, they've got to start acting like President, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with potential talks with President Putin on the horizon, what's your strategy? And given the apparent shift in the Ukrainian conflict, do you believe President Zelenskyy's demand for Crimea's return as a precondition for negotiations is realistic? [SEP] The only rational way this ends is with Putin out of Ukraine, period. But he's not budging, despite the heavy price he's paying and the carnage he's inflicting. I have no immediate plans to call Putin. I'll talk if he shows interest in ending the war, in consultation with our allies. He hasn't yet. We must support Ukraine. The idea of Putin defeating Ukraine is absurd. He's miscalculated everything. He thought he'd be welcomed. Read his speech when he invaded. He wants to be Peter the Great. He's wrong across the board. So, how does he get out of this? I'm ready to talk if he is, but only with NATO allies. Regarding Zelenskyy's preconditions, Ukraine is resisting, suffering war crimes, and leading a counteroffensive. Zelenskyy has a 10-point peace plan. We need to engage with him. He's sincere in wanting to talk. I oversaw the Minsk Agreements. At the last meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin in 2019, Zelenskyy was willing to talk. Putin wanted war. I saw it myself. So, it's fair for Zelenskyy to set conditions. We need to work towards a peace agreement, but it's up to him to decide when and what the choices are. I'll keep talking to Putin, as discussed with President Biden this morning, to prevent escalation and get concrete results. I'll talk about nuclear plant safety, especially Zaporizhzhia. We've worked on Chernobyl, and Mr. Grossi is continuing important work. Thank you.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. President Bush, in your assessment, what, if anything, was accomplished at the Baghdad regional conference? And what are your expectations for future rounds? Also, do you take—do you believe that Iran and Syria were serious in their post-conference statements that they want to help stabilize Iraq? And if that is true, do you see a possibility of opening the way towards more formal direct contacts with those two countries? [SEP] I'm the kind of person that likes people to say something and then do it; then we'll react. Words are easy to say in politics, in the international diplomacy. If they really want to help stabilize Iraq, there are things for them to do, such as cutting off weapon flows and/or the flow of suicide bombers into Iraq. There's all kind of ways to measure whether they're serious about the words they uttered. We, of course, welcome those words. Those are nice statements. And now they can act on them.I thought the conference—well, first of all, I thought the conference got people in the neighborhood to say positive things about the young democracy. In other words, people are now committed publicly to helping Iraq, which was, I thought, very positive. I think the other benefit from the conference is, is that the government gained some confidence. In other words, this young democracy had nations from around the neighborhood and around the world come and talk to them in a way that was constructive and positive.Part of the success in Iraq is going to be whether or not this government has got the confidence necessary to make hard decisions. They're learning what democracy is all about. They've come from a tyranny to democracy in a pretty quick period of time. And I believe the conference will give the different factions inside Iraq the confidence necessary to do the hard things to reconcile and the government the confidence necessary to make the decision so that reconciliation can happen.So it was a positive outcome. And in terms of the expectations of the next meetings, we'll see. But the point is, is that the momentum made in the first one can be carried over to the second one. Secretary Rice will be going to that meeting. In other words, it's a step up in—I'm not dissing anybody, but it's a step up in the pay grade; let's put it that way. [] And I think—and I think Condi is going to—will take an agenda that will help advance this young democracy, and she's going to work with the other nations to do so.. Gracias, President.

[SEP] Look, I'm not really familiar with the intricacies of the movement. I've heard they're big fans, which is always nice, but I don't follow them closely. What I do know is that a lot of people are fed up with what's happening in cities like Portland and Chicago. They see the chaos and they want it to stop. These are patriots who love this country, and they're tired of seeing it go to hell. So, while I don't know much about QAnon specifically, I understand their frustration.
