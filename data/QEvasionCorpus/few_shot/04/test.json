{"sentence": "Q. Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you stated that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars—and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would—what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.However, there are still concerns that the—Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward? [SEP] First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women—across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits—tangible benefits—to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. I—look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times—and it wasn't directly asked, but implied—is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?Think about—as students of history, all of you; and you are—think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.And so I just think this is a—we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings—we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.Economic security dialogue was started—or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.And so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with—along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.Thank you. Thank you very much.Then, let me see.

Our approach is to lead by example and advocate for our values through persuasion. Cuba isn't a direct threat to our national security, but we will continue to address our differences constructively.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, critics are suggesting that your stance on the debt ceiling is unnecessarily rigid. Are you willing to consider any alternative approaches to avoid a potential economic crisis? [SEP] Well, the issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation. And so there's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now, if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don't have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I'm happily to take it. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, had a proposal like that last year, and I'm happy to accept it. But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done. And there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me, you need to fund our Defense Department at such and such a level; you need to send out Social Security checks; you need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans. They lay all this out for me, and because they have the spending power. And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills. Separately, they also have to authorize the raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can't do is tell me to spend X, and then say, but we're not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you joined together with House Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid to sign the energy legislation and talk about the importance of the bill in curbing greenhouse gases, among other goals. However, your administration then told California that it couldn't implement its own plan to restrict tailpipe emissions. How important is fighting greenhouse gases to you? Why can't the States try to do more? And can you tell me anything about your conversation with Vice President Gore about climate change a few weeks ago? [SEP] Remind me about that here. Let me finish the first part of the question, and remind me you asked that.The question is how to have an effective strategy. Is it more effective to let each State make a decision as to how to proceed in curbing greenhouse gases, or is it more effective to have a national strategy? Director Johnson made a decision based upon the fact that we passed a piece of legislation that enables us to have a national strategy, which is the increasing CAFE standards to 35 miles an hour by 2020 and a substantial increase of alternative fuels, 36 billion gallons by 2022.And so the Director, in assessing this law, and assessing what would be more effective for the country, says, we now have a national plan. It's one of the benefits of Congress passing this piece of legislation.I told Vice President Gore that I take the issue seriously. And we're developing a strategy that will deal with it—and an effective strategy. Yesterday's bill is a part of that strategy. When you replace as much gasoline on a mandatory basis as we're suggesting, it's going to do a lot to improve the greenhouse gases. And by the way, the bill I signed was a little weaker than the one I suggested, but nevertheless was happy to sign it.And one of the key components, by the way, to be successful on reformulated fuel standards is to spend research and development money on cellulosic ethanol, new ways to manufacture ethanol. We can't rely only on corn in order to meet these standards. And I understand a lot of people in the farm belt are getting concerned, unless, of course, you're a corn grower. But if you're feeding cattle or feeding hogs, the cost of business has gone up. And that's one of the tradeoffs you have to make. So what I want to assure people out there is that we're spending a lot of taxpayers' money in a way to figure out how to use wood chips or switchgrass in order to make ethanol. But this is a real national plan.Secondly, in order to be effective on a global basis, countries that emit greenhouse gases need to be at the table. One of the main reasons I was against Kyoto was that China wasn't at the table. I mean, we could do all we wanted to do, but it wouldn't affect greenhouse gases over the long run unless a country like China had agreed to participate in a strategy.And so we went to the Bali Conference with that in mind and worked out a compromise that said, we're committed to a process that's going to unfold over the next 2 years. But we've also got a parallel process working to make sure major emitters sit at the table and come together, hopefully, on a goal that we all agree to. And it's a strategy that I laid out at the G- 8 in Germany, it's a strategy that was explained to everybody there in Bali, and it's a strategy we think will be effective.And so, absolutely, I take the issue seriously. But I want to make sure that we're effective in what we do, and secondly, do not wreck our economy in whatever we do. See, it is hard to develop the technologies necessary to be able to make sure our standard of living remains strong and deal with greenhouse gases if you're broke. If you don't have any money, it is really hard to develop new technologies. And so we need to be prosperous for a lot of reasons, primarily so our citizens can have a good life, but also so that we're wealthy enough to make the investments necessary to deal with greenhouse gases.Finally, if you're truly serious about dealing with greenhouse gases, then it seems like to me you ought to be a strong supporter of nuclear power. Nuclear power enables us to generate electricity without emitting one unit of greenhouse gases. I am—to me, I am amazed that our country isn't more robust in supporting the advent of nuclear power. I certainly am, and applaud those efforts by Members of the Congress to provide incentives for the construction of new plants.But if you're somebody that says, Greenhouse gases are of vital national interest, then you ought to be saying, I'm for the development of nuclear power-plants. It is by far the best solution to making sure we have economic growth and, at the same time, be good stewards of the environment.And so when you couple increasing CAFE standards with using alternative fuels—which deals with the automobile area—as well as a good strategy on electricity, then all of a sudden, you begin to see a strategy unfold. And by the way, the final thing is, is that we do have 250 years of coal. And I believe we can develop technologies that will enable us to use that coal in an environmentally friendly way.So what I'm suggesting to you is, is that we do have a strategy. Our strategy is to bring others to the table. Our strategy is to develop our own plan to meet the national goals—the international goals that I hope we'll be able to set later on this summer. And you've just heard some of the components of it.Yes, sir.", "label": "Explicit"}

But I will say that the Paris Agreement, as drawn and as we signed, was very unfair to the United States. It put great penalties on us. It made it very difficult for us to deal, in terms of business. It took away a lot of our asset values.We are a country rich in gas and coal and oil and lots of other things, and there was a tremendous penalty for using it. It hurt our businesses. According to some estimates, we would have had to close businesses in order to qualify by 2025. Whereas, as an example, China, by 2030—they don't kick in until 2030. Russia, someplace in the mid-1990s—that was their standard, and that was never a good standard, because that was a dirty standard for the environment.It treated the United States very unfairly, and frankly, it's an agreement that I have no problem with, but I had a problem with the agreement that they signed, because as usual, they made a bad deal.So we could conceivably go back in, but I say this: We are very strong on the environment. I feel very strongly about the environment. Our EPA and our EPA commissioners are very, very powerful in the sense that they want to have clean water, clean air, but we also want businesses that can compete. And the Paris accord really would have taken away our competitive edge. And we're not going to let that happen. I'm not going to let it happen.. And if I just might add that there are business opportunities in this—— . It's true.. ——as we talked about during this—because we have strict regulations on—to reach our Paris targets. That means that we have very strong policies for environmental-friendly and climate-friendly technologies, and which is a small part of why the United States now have a surplus in the economy towards Norway. So you never miss up on a good opportunity with good environmental standards. Okay. . One of the great assets of Norway is a thing called water. And they have tremendous hydropower—tremendous.

Everyone's looking for a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. And in an election year, you can bet some folks will try to score political points. That being said, I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do. It's good for America, good for the region, good for the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for the U.S. Most countries here already sell their stuff to us with relatively low tariffs, while our goods face significantly higher tariffs there. So, a deal that eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in these markets is a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for exposing us to countries with lower wages and lax labor and environmental standards. But TPP includes enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and address environmental problems. This allows us to engage with countries like Vietnam on these issues. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will make us worse off. We'll demonstrably be better off. American workers and businesses will benefit. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements I inherited. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too, despite the bumps along the way. As for currency manipulation, TPP includes provisions for transparency and reporting. Some argue for enforceable provisions allowing us to impose tariffs if currency is devalued. But it's hard to determine when currency is being manipulated. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. We've strengthened provisions to put folks on notice if we think they're engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, regarding the Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, his death has been confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This doesn't represent a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself.

And also, the effect of the gasoline prices, isn't that about to erase or certainly erode the benefit of the economic stimulus package? [SEP] Yes, no question, rising gasoline prices are like a tax on our working people. And what's happening is, is that we've had an energy policy that neglected hydrocarbons in the United States for a long period of time, and now we're paying the price. We should have been exploring for oil and gas in ANWR, for example. But no, we made the decision: Our Congress kept preventing us from opening up new areas to explore in environmentally friendly ways, and now we're becoming, as a result, more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil. Fortunately, Canada and Mexico are our biggest providers, for which we are grateful. But our energy policy is— wasn't effective over the past decades, and now we're paying the price.And secondly, there's not a lot of excess capacity in the world. As a matter of fact, unfortunately, a lot of the supplies are coming from parts of the world where there's political instability. Fortunately, again, Canada and Mexico are not included in that group. There are some countries that are not reinvesting in their reserves, which decline without maintenance.And so I'm obviously concerned for our consumers. All the more reason to have passed a rebate, tax relief, and all the more reason for the United States Congress to keep the tax relief I passed permanent. We got people out there campaigning: Well, we're just going to tax the rich. You can't raise enough money to meet their spending appetites by taxing the so-called rich. Every one of those so-called tax-the-rich schemes end up taxing the middle class families. And in a time of economic uncertainty, we need tax certainty. In a time of rising gasoline prices, we need to be sending a message to all Americans: We're not going to raise your taxes.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the upcoming NATO summit in Chicago, are you confident that member nations will reach a consensus on the Afghanistan withdrawal strategy? And, to what extent do you believe the recent Koran burning incident and subsequent unrest will complicate negotiations with our allies? [SEP] Well, the roadmap for the transition has been in place since Lisbon, and we've been following that strategy, which calls for a phased handover of responsibilities to the Afghan government, culminating in the cessation of our combat role by the end of 2014. Our coalition partners remain committed to this timeline. At the NATO meeting, we'll be focusing on refining the transition process to ensure a smooth and sustainable transfer of authority. This involves establishing clear benchmarks and milestones, similar to our approach in Iraq, to ensure that Afghan forces are adequately prepared to assume full security responsibilities. Now, the Koran burning incident is certainly a cause for concern, and it underscores the complexities of the situation on the ground. It serves as a reminder of the challenges we face as we transition to Afghan leadership. While the violence directed at our personnel is unacceptable, President Karzai has expressed a desire for greater Afghan control over security matters. We're committed to working with the Afghan government to develop a framework that respects their sovereignty while ensuring the continued stability and security of the region. While the path forward may not be without its challenges, I remain optimistic that we can achieve a successful transition in Afghanistan.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Why haven't we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that? [SEP] I've written them personal letters. They've been sent, or they're going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend. I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families—because I have done that, traditionally. I felt very, very badly about that. I always feel badly. It's the toughest—the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It's a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day—it's a very, very tough day. For me, that's by far the toughest.So, the traditional way—if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn't make calls, a lot of them didn't make calls. I like to call when it's appropriate, when I think I'm able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice.So, generally, I would say that I like to call. I'm going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I'm going to be calling them. I have—as you know, since I've been President, I have.

The best way to achieve this is to collaborate with Egypt to halt the flow of arms into Gaza, which allows Hamas to launch rockets. Nations providing weapons to Hamas must cease.

Also, President Vazquez, did you request President Bush's intervention in your dispute with Argentina over the mill plants? [SEP] We spent considerable time discussing Uruguay's concerns about market access for specific goods. The President raised several trade-related issues, particularly the fairness of quotas on items like beef and lamb. I assured him that I would seriously consider his requests. You might have thought I was joking about blueberries, but I wasn't. Uruguay produces exceptional blueberries, and the key question is whether those blueberry growers can sell their products in the United States. So, we discussed a range of agricultural products. I emphasized to the President that problems can only be solved if they are brought to the table. Where we can assist, we will; where we cannot, I will provide a clear explanation. You mentioned protectionist tendencies, which concern me both in our country and globally. I believe that free and fair trade promotes poverty reduction. Therefore, I strongly support completing the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with President Lula, who was very interested in our conversations. I didn't disclose any confidential information, but I discussed how we can move the Doha round forward. The United States is prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, as I explained to the President, but we need market access for our products. I conveyed this to President Lula, the Europeans, and President Vazquez. I am optimistic about reaching a deal. Our trade minister, Susan Schwab, remains in Sao Paulo to continue discussions with her Brazilian counterpart, aiming to make progress on this complex but essential agreement. Thank you. In response to your first question, I fully agree with President Bush's remarks. This meeting has created a platform for our experts and ministers to discuss and advance bilateral relations. Regarding the multilateral situation, Uruguay advocates for free trade and lower tariffs and subsidies that hinder the sale of our cultural products. We have also explored the possibility of advancing the GSP, particularly on issues to be considered in the coming weeks. As for your second question, I did not discuss our issues with Argentina with President Bush, partly because we will be engaging in dialogue with Argentina in a few weeks, thanks to the conciliation efforts of His Majesty, the King of Spain.

{"sentence": "Q. Speaking of Iraq, there are increasing controversy in Iraq over the security agreement that's being negotiated. Some top Iraqi officials are calling for a dramatic reduction in the U.S. presence. Does this concern you that the direction that those negotiations are going in?And, Madam Chancellor, does this have any impact on your approach towards Iraq? [SEP] First of all, I think we'll end up with a strategic agreement with Iraq. You know, it's all kinds of noise in their system and our system. What eventually will win out is the truth. For example, you read stories, perhaps in your newspaper, that the U.S. is planning all kinds of permanent bases in Iraq. That's an erroneous story. The Iraqis know—will learn it's erroneous too. We'll be there at the invitation of the sovereign Government of Iraq.And I strongly support the agreement because I think it helps send a clear message to the people of Iraq that, you know, that security you're now seeing will continue. And one of the lessons of Iraq is, is that in order for a democracy to develop or in order for an economy to develop, there has to be a measure of security, which is now happening. And so I think we'll get the agreement done.And as I said clearly in past speeches, this will not involve permanent bases, nor will it bind any future President to troop levels. You know, as to—look, Eggen, you can find any voice you want in the Iraqi political scene and quote them, which is interesting, isn't it? Because in the past you could only find one voice, and now you can find a myriad of voices. It's a vibrant democracy; people are debating. There's all kinds of press in the Iraqi scene, of course, to the benefit of the Iraqi society.And I deal with Prime Minister Maliki. He appreciates our presence there, and he understands that we're returning on success. As the situation merits and the situation improves, we're bringing our troops home. And I'm pleased with the progress. I don't know whether or not it's—the progress has made it here to Germany or not yet, but the progress in Iraq is substantial, and it's going to help change the Middle East for the better. And I love the idea of having—giving people a chance to live in a free society. The blessings of freedom are—shouldn't be just in a regional blessing. I believe freedom is universal, and I believe freedom yields peace.Madam Chancellor. Well, obviously, from the German side too, and the European side for that matter, we have every interest, indeed, a vital interest in seeing Iraq taking a turn for sort of a good kind of development. I invited the Iraqi Prime Minister here to Germany, and I think he will pay us the honor of a visit. We have been trying to have economic relations. We've also, outside of Iraq, also trained security personnel, and we're ready to continue that.So everything we can do beyond a sort of military presence, everything we can do as regards civilian building up of the country, assisting them, is something that we're continuing to doing. And I would like to very much look forward to the visit of the Prime Minister.

Sometimes, they just get the sniffles; sometimes, they just get something where they're not feeling quite right. And sometimes, they feel really bad.But that's a little bit like the flu.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Patricia Zengerle from Reuters. There's been much criticism of U.S. monetary policy in the runup to this G-20. And with old G-7 partners like Germany opposing you, does this not make it much harder for the United States to press China for yuan appreciation and persuade other G-20 partners to support your goals if they sense that the U.S. is being isolated at the summit? [SEP] Well, I think that you will see at this summit a broad-based agreement from all countries, including Germany, that we need to ensure balanced and sustainable growth. And it is my expectation that the communique will begin to put in place mechanisms that help us track and encourage such balanced and sustainable growth.The most important thing that the United States can do for the world economy is to grow, because we continue to be the world's largest market and a huge engine for all other countries to grow. Countries like Germany that export heavily benefit from our open markets and us buying their goods. That's true for every G-20 member.And so the point that we have consistently made is that in a prudent, stable way, we want to make sure that we are boosting growth rates at home as well as abroad. It is difficult to do that if we start seeing the huge imbalances redevelop that helped to contribute to the crisis that we just went through. And I don't think this is a controversial proposition. In fact, we set up a framework back in Pittsburgh that discussed this, and this is just a follow-on to the work that we've already done.Now, as I've said, I think, when I was first asked this in India, it's not our habit to comment on actions by the Federal Reserve. But as President of the United States, I can tell you that my instructions to my team, including Secretary Geithner, is to focus every single day on how we can grow our economy, how we can increase exports, how we can make sure that even as we're buying goods from places like South Korea, we're also selling goods to places like South Korea.That's part of the reason why we think that getting this Korea-U.S. free trade agreement done is so important. And President Lee and I discussed this, and our instructions are we're not--we don't want months to pass before we get this done; we want this to be done in a matter of weeks.So bottom line is, Patricia, I think that when you see the final communique, it will reflect a broad-based consensus about the direction that we need to go. There may be on any given--at any given moment disagreements between countries in terms of particular strategies. That's not surprising because each country has unique problems and finds itself in different positions. Countries like Germany historically are very sensitive to issues like inflation. But I don't think you'll get any objection to their belief that if the U.S. isn't growing, that's not good for the rest of the world.It also doesn't negate the fact that if we--if individual countries are engaging in practices that are purposely designed to boost their exports at the expense of others, that that can contribute to problems as opposed to solving them.", "label": "Deflection"}

Can you understand why he had the position he did? And then on the other hand, is it intellectually consistent to say that gay and lesbians should be able to fight and die for this country but they should not be able to marry the people they love? [SEP] You know, I don't want to go into detail about conversations in the Oval Office with my service chiefs. Jim Amos expressed the same concerns to me privately that he expressed publicly during his testimony. He said that there could be disruptions as a consequence of this. And what I said to him was that I was confident, looking at the history of the military with respect to racial integration, with respect to the inclusion of women in our Armed Forces, that that could be managed. And that was confirmed by the attitudinal studies that was done prior to this vote.And what he assured me of, and what all the service chiefs have assured me of, is that regardless of their concerns about disruptions, they were confident that they could implement this policy without it affecting our military cohesion and good discipline and readiness. And I take them at their word. And I've spoken to them since the vote took place and they have all said that we are going to implement this smartly and swiftly, and they are confident that it will not have an effect on our military effectiveness.So I'm very heartened by that. And I want to again give Bob Gates and Admiral Mullen enormous credit for having guided this process through in a way that preserves our primary responsibility to keep America safe and at the same time allows us to live up to our values.With respect to the issue of whether gays and lesbians should be able to get married, I've spoken about this recently. As I've said, my feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this. I have friends, I have people who work for me, who are in powerful, strong, long-lasting gay or lesbian unions. And they are extraordinary people, and this is something that means a lot to them and they care deeply about.At this point, what I've said is, is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have.

She engaged with representatives from Japan, South Korea, China, and Russia. Her assessment is that all countries recognize the importance of close collaboration to peacefully resolve this situation, which entails adherence to the most recent UN Security Council resolution. The leader of North Korea is prone to making threats. In my view, he is testing the resolve of the five countries working together to persuade him that there is a more beneficial path for his people.

[SEP] Look, the situation is complex. We always knew it would be. The IAEA has confirmed that Iran is holding up its end of the bargain, dismantling its nuclear program as agreed. Now, businesses are naturally cautious, and they need reassurance. Secretary Lew and others are working to provide clarity about permissible transactions. It's going to take time for companies to feel secure enough to invest. But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture: we've prevented Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has has not sealed this border? And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?And then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you've left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House? [SEP] Just with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. [] I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world and that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.Now, the fact of the matter is, there's a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties. I mean, you travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things; one thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.So whoever is the President—next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus—not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders—think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that's why it's important for us to not project what's being said on a campaign trail, but to do what's right and make the case.And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing as well. Sometimes, it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I'm doing, but that's more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that's why I think people should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We've seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there's about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I'm also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around—or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border. We have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey. Not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment. And Turkey has continued to keep those borders open for people in real need.So I'm proud that the United States is the single largest contributor of humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. I'm glad that the EU is looking to do more to help Turkey manage those refugee flows. But I also think the EU rightly wants to see the kind of orderly process along the Turkish-Greek border that's necessary for Europe to be able to regulate the amount of refugees it's absorbing and to save the lives of refugees who are oftentimes taking enormous risks because they're being ferried back and forth by human traffickers who are now operating in the same ways that you see drug traffickers operating under: at enormous profit and without regard for human life.", "label": "Implicit"}

But there's been fresh opposition to that ban from the NRA. And even Harry Reid has said that he questions whether it could pass Congress. Given that, how hard will you push for an assault weapons ban? And if one cannot pass Congress, what other measures would need to be included in a broad package in order to curb gun violence successfully? [SEP] All right. Well, as I said, the Vice President and a number of members of my Cabinet went through a very thorough process over the last month, meeting with a lot of stakeholders in this, including the NRA, listened to proposals from all quarters, and they've presented me now with a list of sensible, commonsense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn't happen again.I'm going to be meeting with the Vice President today. I expect to have a fuller presentation later in the week to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do.My starting point is not to worry about the politics, my starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works: What should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we're reducing the incidents of gun violence? And I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment.And then Members of Congress, I think, are going to have to have a debate and examine their own conscience, because if, in factand I believe this is trueeverybody across party lines was as deeply moved and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we're going to have to vote based on what we think is best. We're going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside. And that's what I expect Congress to do.But what you can count is, is that the things that I've said in the pastthe belief that we have to have stronger background checks, that we can do a much better job in terms of keeping these magazine clips with high capacity out of the hands of folks who shouldn't have them, an assault weapons ban that is meaningfulthat those are things I continue to believe make sense.Okay. Will all of them get through this Congress? I don't know. But what's uppermost in my mind is making sure that I'm honest with the American people and with Members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference.

[SEP] Well, look, the idea that I'm going to say—which I would never do—if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side—no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.That's why I've asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It's because of earthquakes, floods. It's because of lack of food. It's because of gang violence. It's because of a whole range of things.That—when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like—in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is, they couldn't walk in the street because they were getting—their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say: Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I'll put the lighting in. We've got a contractor. We've got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the Government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.When this hurricane occurred—two hurricanes—instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn't have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing.

We're going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.That mother did not sit around with—on the kitchen table and say: You know, I've got a great idea: The way I'm going to make sure my son get taken care of is, I'm going to put a—how old was he, or she?", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, the Iraq Study Group said that leaders must be candid and forthright with people. So let me test that. Are you capable of admitting your failures in the past, and perhaps much more importantly, are you capable of changing course, perhaps in the next few weeks? [SEP] I think you're probably going to have to pay attention to my speech coming up here when I get all the recommendations in, and you can answer that question yourself. I do know that we have not succeeded as fast as we wanted to succeed. I do understand that progress is not as rapid as I had hoped. And therefore, it makes sense to analyze the situation and to devise a set of tactics and strategies to achieve the objective that I have stated.And so if the present situation needs to be changed, it follows that we'll change it if we want to succeed. What's really interesting is, the battle has changed in Iraq from the rejectionists and former Ba'athists and definitely foreign fighters who have entered the country that were trying to destabilize the new Government to one that Mr. Zarqawi stated clearly—he said, Look, let's kill Shi'a in order to create enough chaos and confusion and doubt of the Government, and set off a sectarian battle. And he succeeded in that extent. He didn't succeed at avoiding us, but he did succeed at starting off sectarian strife. And now the fundamental question is, what strategy is necessary to deal with this type of violence?We'll continue after Al Qaida. Al Qaida will not have safe haven in Iraq. And that's important for the American people to know. We've got special operators. We've got better intelligence. And there is—Al Qaida is effective at these spectacular bombings, and we'll chase them down, and we are, along with the Iraqis. The strategy now is how to make sure that we've got the security situation in place such that the Iraqi Government is capable of dealing with the sectarian violence, as well as the political and economic strategies as well.So yes, I think you'll see something differently, because it's a practical answer to a situation on the ground that's not the way we'd like it. You wanted frankness; I thought we would succeed quicker than we did, and I am disappointed by the pace of success. I mean, look, there isn't any—as I said a moment or two ago, there isn't any doubt about how tough this is. It's hugely challenging. But what the report did not say is that we should just get out and leave it. What it did say is that it's immensely important that we succeed.Now, the question is, therefore, how do we do it? And in that regard, I think the report is practical, it's clear, and it offers also the way of bringing people together.The other thing that we want to do, because this is part of succeeding in this mission, is actually to make people understand that this is something where you've got to try and bring people together around a set of common objectives and a practical set of methods to achieve those objectives.And, you know, the issues that the report raises—I mean, these aren't issues that, obviously, no one has ever thought of; these aren't issues that haven't been part of the continual discussion and debate and iteration within the coalition and, indeed, between us and the Iraqi Government. But those essential elements—we want to make sure, in the light of the changing situation that there is there, that, one, we have the Iraqi Government able to operate effectively, but in a nonsectarian way, because that's what we began with. Secondly, that we make sure that everyone in the region is supporting that. And thirdly, that we set this within the context of a broader vision for the Middle East, not least in respect of Israel and Palestine.Now, in respect of the elements of that strategy, this report gives us a basis on which we can move forward, but we've obviously then got to look at the practical measures that are necessary in order to give effect to those elements. And that's what we'll do. And I think that, you know, the one thing that no one who is dealing with this on a day-to-day basis has any doubt about is how tough it is. But the question is, how we make sure that we overcome those tough conditions and succeed, because the need to succeed is so huge.", "label": "Implicit"}

However, I do remember being quite concerned about the persistent leaks. The press, of course, diligently seeks information and disseminates it, which I understand. But the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents is unacceptable. This is a recurring issue, not just for this administration, but for any administration attempting to implement policy. We've experienced numerous leaks, some of which are of unknown origin, so I won't speculate on their source.

And, you know, I told the President; I said: You can't solve problems unless you put the problems on the table, and that where we could help, we would; and where we couldn't, I would give an explanation as to why not.Now, you brought up protectionist tendencies, and I'm concerned about protectionist tendencies, not only with our own country but around the world. I happen to believe a world that trades freely and fairly is a world that is more likely to be able to address poverty. And therefore, I'm a strong supporter of completing the Doha round of the WTO.I shared with the President about our strategies as to advance the Doha round. I spent a lot of time with President Lula; he was most interested in our conversations, and I shared our conversations. I didn't betray any confidences, of course, but I talked to him about how we need to advance the Doha round. The United States is fully prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, as I explained to the President. We just want to make sure there is market access for our products. And that's what I told President Lula, that's what I've told the Europeans, and that's what I shared with the President.I'm optimistic we can get a deal done. As a matter of fact, our trade minister is— Susan Schwab has remained in Sao Paulo to talk to her Brazilian counterpart, all aiming at continuing to make progress toward what is a complicated, but necessary deal.Thank you. As an answer to your first question, I fully agree with what has just been expressed by the President of the United States. We have created a space, starting with this meeting, where our experts, our ministers are going to discuss and make progress on issues of bilateral relationships.Now, concerning the general multilateral situation, Uruguay has made clear its position in the defense of free trade and tried to have a drop of tariffs and subsidies, which hinder the sale of our great cultural products, particularly. But we have also analyzed the possibility of making progress with the GSP, particularly on certain issues that are going to be considered in the coming weeks.As to the second part of your question, I have not talked about the problems we have with the republic of Argentina with the President of the United States, amongst other things, because in a few days from now—in a few weeks, and thanks to the conciliation of His Majesty, the King of Spain—we are going to get closer. We're not going to negotiate; we're going to have a dialog between the two Governments in order to find a friendly way out. We're going to try to come to an understanding and to be able to solve the very sad differences that we have with our brethren of Argentina.", "label": "Explicit"}

I said: Because he's in violation of an international norm. It's called a Chemical Weapons Treaty. Can't be trusted. It's about trust. It's about their ability to influence other nations in a positive way.Look, would you like to trade our economy for 's economy? Would you like to trade? And by the way, we talked about trade. I don't have any problem with doing business with , as long as they do it based upon international norms. It's in our interest to see the n people do well economically. I don't have a problem with that.But if they do not act according to international norms, then guess what? That will not—that only won't it happen with us, it will not happen with other nations. And he kind of talked about that—didn't he, today?—about how the need to reach out to other countries to invest in . They won't as long as they are convinced that, in fact, the violations—for example, the American businessman who was in house arrest. And I had pointed out: You want to get American business to invest? Let him go. Change the dynamic. Because American businessmen, they're not ready to show up. They don't want to hang around in Moscow.I mean, I—look, guys, I know we make foreign policy out to be this great, great skill that somehow is, sort of, like a secret code. Practical—all foreign policy is, is a logical extension of personal relationships. It's the way human nature functions.And understand, when you run a country that does not abide by international norms, and yet you need those international norms to be somehow managed so that you can participate in the benefits that flow from them, it hurts you.

What kind of assurances did you give Prime Minister Netanyahu about the role that the U.S. would play if diplomacy and economic sanctions fail to work to convince Iranian--Iran's leaders to change their behavior, and Israel goes ahead and prepares to strike a nuclear facility? What kind of assurances did you tell him? And shouldn't we--I recognize the difference between debate and bluster--but shouldn't we be having in this country a vigorous debate about what could happen in the case of a Middle East war in a way that, sadly, we did not do before going into Iraq? [SEP] Well, I think there's no doubt that those who are suggesting or proposing or beating the drums of war should explain clearly to the American people what they think the costs and benefits would be.I'm not one of those people, because what I've said is, is that we have a window through which we can resolve this issue peacefully. We have put forward an international framework that is applying unprecedented pressure. The Iranians just stated that they are willing to return to the negotiating table. And we've got the opportunity, even as we maintain that pressure, to see how it plays out.I'm not going to go into the details of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But what I said publicly doesn't differ greatly from what I said privately. Israel is a sovereign nation that has to make its own decisions about how best to preserve its security. And as I said over the last several days, I am deeply mindful of the historical precedents that weigh on any Prime Minister of Israel when they think about the potential threats to Israel and the Jewish homeland.What I've also said is that because sanctions are starting to have significant effect inside of Iran--and that's not just my assessment, that's, I think, a uniform assessment--because the sanctions are going to be even tougher in the coming months, because they're now starting to affect their oil industry, their central bank, and because we're now seeing noises about them returning to the negotiating table, that it is deeply in everybody's interests, the United States, Israel, and the world's, to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful fashion.And so this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or 2 weeks, or month or 2 months, is not borne out by the facts. And the argument that we've made to the Israelis is that we have made an unprecedented commitment to their security. There is an unbreakable bond between our two countries, but one of the functions of friends is to make sure that we provide honest and unvarnished advice in terms of what is the best approach to achieve a common goal, particularly one in which we have a stake. This is not just an issue of Israeli interest, this is an issue of U.S. interests. It's also not just an issue of consequences for Israel if action is taken prematurely. There are consequences to the United States as well.And so I do think that any time we consider military action, that the American people understand there's going to be a price to pay. Sometimes, it's necessary. But we don't do it casually.When I visit Walter Reed, when I sign letters to families that haven't--whose loved ones have not come home, I am reminded that there is a cost. Sometimes, we bear that cost. But we think it through. We don't play politics with it. When we have in the past--when we haven't thought it through and it gets wrapped up in politics--we make mistakes. And typically, it's not the folks who are popping off who pay the price. It's these incredible men and women in uniform and their families who pay the price.And as a consequence, I think it's very important for us to take a careful, thoughtful, sober approach to what is a real problem.

Furthermore, how confident are you that this progress will persist or even expand under the incoming administration? [SEP] I am incredibly proud of the progress our society has made in the last decade. While I believe we contributed in a meaningful way, the true heroes are the activists, the sons and daughters, and the couples who bravely declared, 'This is who I am, and I'm proud.' Their courage opened hearts and minds, and eventually, the laws followed. But none of this would have been possible without their activism, whether loud and visible or quiet and personal. Our administration's role was to help society move forward in a way that minimized backlash and respected the fact that these issues were often controversial. Take, for example, our approach to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' By being methodical, working with the Joint Chiefs, and demonstrating that it wouldn't impact the effectiveness of our military, we were able to achieve meaningful change. I am proud of the work of Secretary Gates, Chairman Mullen, and the Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately did the right thing. But again, this wouldn't have happened without the incredible transformation happening in society. When I awarded Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant every word. Her kindness and likability, projected into living rooms across the country, changed attitudes. That wasn't easy for her, and it's just one example of what was happening in communities nationwide. I'm proud that we were able to provide some support to help the movement advance. I believe this progress is irreversible because American society has changed, especially the attitudes of young people.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The Republican cochair of the supercommittee, Jeb Hensarling, went on TV today and said if the sequester happens--this idea of the automatic cuts in Medicare and defense--that there was plenty of motivation and plenty of votes to change the makeup of these automatic cuts.I know you had a conversation with him about this and said that that was--changing it in any way was off the table. That means you're going to veto this bill, if that's the case, if it ends up they can't get a deal in the next 10 days.And then, can you clarify your end of the hot mike conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as it involved Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu? [SEP] Could I just say that Chuck's the only guy who asked two questions so far. So just--when I cut off here, whoever was next in the queue--[]--I'm messing with you, Chuck.With respect to the supercommittee, in August we negotiated to initiate a trillion dollars in cuts over the next 10 years, primarily out of discretionary spending, but we also said that in order for us to move towards a more stable fiscal condition that we're going to have to get an additional 1.2, minimum. I actually argued that we needed more than that. And the whole idea of the sequester was to make sure that both sides felt obligated to move off rigid positions and do what was required to help the country.And since that time, they've had a lot of conversations, but it feels as if people continue to try to stick with their rigid positions rather than solve the problem.Now, I've put forward a very detailed approach that would achieve $3 trillion-plus in savings. And it's the sort of balanced approach that the American people prefer. It says everything's on the table. We've got to have discretionary spending cuts of the sort we've already put in place. We've got to have nondefense cuts. We've got to have defense cuts. We're going to have to look at entitlement programs. We've got to reduce our health care costs. And we're going to need additional revenue.And when we're talking about revenue, if we've got to raise money, it makes sense for us to start by asking the wealthiest among us to pay a little bit more before we start asking seniors, for example, to pay a lot more for their Medicare.Now, this is the same presentation that I made to Speaker Boehner back in August. It's the same kind of balanced approach that every single independent committee that's looked at this has said needs to be done. And it just feels as if people keep on wanting to jigger the math so that they get a different outcome.Well, the equation, no matter how you do it, is going to be the same. If you want a balanced approach that doesn't gut Medicare and Medicaid, doesn't prevent us from making investments in education and basic science and research--all the things we've been talking about here at APEC, that every world leader understands is the key for long-term economic success--then prudent cuts have to be matched up with revenue.My hope is that over the next several days, the congressional leadership on the supercommittee go ahead and bite the bullet and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change. There's no magic formula. There are no magic beans that you can toss on the ground, and suddenly, a bunch of money grows on trees. We got to just go ahead and do the responsible thing. And I'm prepared to sign legislation that is balanced, that solves this problem.One other thing that I want to say about this: When I meet with world leaders, what's striking--whether it's in Europe or here in Asia--the kinds of fundamental reforms and changes both on the revenue side and the public pension side that other countries are having to make are so much more significant than what we need to do in order to get our books in order.This doesn't require radical changes to America or its way of life. It just means that we spread out the sacrifice across every sector so that it's fair, so that people don't feel as if once again people who are well connected, people who have lobbyists, special interests get off easy, and the burden is placed on middle class families that are already struggling. So if other countries can do it, we can do it, and we can do it in a responsible way.I'm not going to comment on whether I'd veto a particular bill until I actually see a bill, because I still hold out the prospect that there's going to be a light-bulb moment where everybody says: Aha! Here's what we've got to do.With respect to the hot mike in France, I'm not going to comment on conversations that I have with individual leaders, but what I will say is this: The primary conversation I had with President Sarkozy in that meeting revolved around my significant disappointment that France had voted in favor of the Palestinians joining UNESCO, knowing full well that under our laws, that would require the United States cutting off funding to UNESCO, and after I had consistently made the argument that the only way we're going to solve the Middle East situation is if Palestinians and Israelis sit down at the table and negotiate, that it is not going to work to try to do an end run through the United Nations.So I had a very frank and firm conversation with President Sarkozy about that issue.

What's the purpose? What does it mean for NATO members? We all want a modernized Russia, one where we can do good business, build neighborly relations, and cooperate across many areas. But today, we must respond by supporting Ukraine's independence and its right to choose a pro-Western path. We must also support Ukraine's modernization. I believe this is the right approach, a strong example for Russian society, just as Poland's democratic development, free market, prosperity, and security served as an example. It influenced Ukraine, inspiring them to follow the same values. I'm convinced that a successful, democratic, and independent Ukraine, overcoming its economic and political crises, will significantly shape attitudes within Russian society. It's clear that Russian public opinion has largely supported Putin's aggressive actions in Crimea. But Russian public opinion should support Russia's modernization, not the reconstitution of spheres of influence or imperial dreams. That concludes this press conference.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, the current approach to renewing old insurance policies hinges on the discretion of state commissioners and insurance companies. How certain are you that they will actually permit these renewals? Furthermore, are you concerned that the problematic rollout of the ACA could negatively impact Democratic prospects in the upcoming midterms and hinder your ability to push forward other important initiatives like immigration reform? [SEP] Let's be clear, the states have always had a significant role in regulating insurance. What we're doing is acknowledging that reality. The ACA isn't dictating every single choice in the individual market. I anticipate many states will take advantage of this flexibility. Now, each state's market is unique. Some already have strong consumer protections, aligning closely with the ACA. Others, frankly, have weaker standards. That's where people might see premium fluctuations. So, it's a state-by-state situation. But the core message is this: I, as President, am ensuring the ACA doesn't prevent people from keeping their current plans. Some might find the marketplaces better in the long run. Think of it like car safety. We mandated seatbelts and airbags, which added costs initially, but the benefits outweighed the costs. The ACA is like requiring a new, safer car. The grandfather clause was like saying, 'You have to buy a new car, even if you can't afford it.' If people want to keep their old car for now, even if the new one is better, we should allow that. That's the goal here.", "label": "Dodging"}

Our strategy rests on a combination of international agreements, rigorous enforcement, and close collaboration with our allies. We successfully negotiated extensions to the arms embargo and ballistic missile restrictions within the UN framework. However, these are not the only tools at our disposal. We have independent legal authorities that enable us to interdict shipments. The key challenge lies not just in the legal framework, but in our intelligence and interdiction capabilities. We are working to enhance these capabilities with our partners in the region. Looking ahead, my hope is to leave behind a Middle East where ISIS is significantly weakened, a process for resolving the Syrian civil war is underway, and Iraq is on a path toward stability.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday Seattle City Council voted to cut funding for their police department, and the chief—the police chief there, Carmen Best, the first Black woman to serve in that capacity—she resigned hours later. What does this say about our country? And what does this say about the defund police movement? [SEP] Well, I think that Seattle, in spite of all that they've been through, with the embarrassment of having a radical left group—Antifa and others—take over a big portion of the city of Seattle—we're talking about a big city, a major city. That they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. And the only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day, and so they preceded us. They didn't want that to happen. They don't want to be embarrassed. And the people just gave up. They weren't—they were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long.The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department, really, where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job.So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.They've done a big—a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle has made a tragic mistake.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, neither of you has shown much doubt about your Iraq policies. Do you acknowledge that your approach has failed, as Baker-Hamilton suggests? And are you willing to engage directly with Syria and Iran and pull out most combat forces by early 2008, unless there's unexpected circumstances? [SEP] The thing I liked about the Baker-Hamilton report is it discussed the way forward in Iraq. And I believe we need a new approach. And that's why I've tasked the Pentagon to analyze the way forward. That's why Prime Minister Blair is here to talk about the way forward, so we can achieve the objective, which is an Iraq which can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself and be an ally in the war on terror.And the Baker-Hamilton report did some very interesting things. First, it shows that Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an—to come up with a strategy to achieve an objective, something the American people don't think is possible to happen. In other words, they've seen elections, and they saw all the bitterness and finger-pointing and name-calling and wonder whether or not we can work together on this important cause. And I believe we can, and the Baker-Hamilton commission showed it's possible for people of good will to sit down at the table and design a way forward.And so that's why I'm sitting down with the Members of Congress, to say to both Republicans and Democrats, This is an important cause. It's important for our security. It's important to help lay the foundations for peace, and I want to hear your ideas. And I thought the report did a good job of showing what is possible. The Congress isn't going to accept every recommendation in the report, and neither will the administration, but there's a lot of very important things in the report that we ought to seriously consider.And as the Prime Minister talked about, there's three aspects to the report. One is, how do we empower the Maliki Government so that the Maliki Government—the elected Government of the Iraqis—can help with the economy, can help secure peace, can do hard work necessary to achieve stability and to achieve the objective?It talked about the regional—the countries in the region and the responsibilities of the region to help this Iraqi Government. And the idea of having an international group is an interesting idea. We've already got the compact, and I think the Baker-Hamilton report suggests that we broaden the Compact beyond just economic measures.But one thing is for certain: When people—if people come to the table to discuss Iraq, they need to come understanding their responsibilities to not fund terrorists, to help this young democracy survive, to help with the economics of the country. And if people are not committed, if Syria and Iran is not committed to that concept, then they shouldn't bother to show up.Thirdly, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is an—is important to have—is important to be solved. I'm committed to a two-state solution. I believe it is in Israel's interest and the Palestinian people's interest to have two states living side by side for peace. And the Prime Minister shares that goal, and he is willing to take time to go over and help remove obstacles toward achieving that goal.And there are two notable obstacles. One is the prisoner, and secondly, is for there to be a unity government that recognizes the principles of the Quartet, with which Israel can negotiate. And we want to help.And so I view this as a very important way forward, with important concepts. And the American people expect us to come up with a new strategy to achieve the objective which I've been talking about and which is laid out in the Baker-Hamilton report. Look, I think the analysis of the situation is not really in dispute. The question is, how do we find the right way forward? And what we've got at the moment is something that is at one level very simple to describe but at another level very profound and difficult to deal with, and that is that the outside extremists are linking up with internal extremists, basically to create the circumstances of sectarianism, where it's very, very difficult then for democracy and ordinary institutions to function.And I think the Baker-Hamilton report allows us to—as the situation has evolved in Iraq—to evolve our strategy in order to meet it in the ways that I've just described. But I think we've got to be very, very clear about this: It will require everybody to face up to their responsibilities—us, of course, because we are principal actors in this, but also the Iraqi Government. They've got to be prepared to make the moves necessary—full governance, full capability, reconciliation, and full help and security—and we will be there to support them.But then there's responsibilities, as the President was saying a moment or two ago, on the region and the neighbors. And let me come directly to the Iran and Syria point. The issue for me is not a question of being unwilling to sit down with people or not, but the basis upon which we discuss Iraq has got to be clear, and it's got to be a basis where we are all standing up for the right principles, which are now endorsed in the United Nations resolutions, in respect of Iraq. In other words, you support the democratic elected Government; you do not support sectarians; and you do not support, arm, or finance terrorists.Now, the very reason we have problems in parts of Iraq—and we know this very well down in the south of Iraq—is that Iran, for example, has been doing that. It's been basically arming, financing, supporting terrorism. So we've got to be clear the basis upon which we take this forward. And as I say, it's got to be on the basis of people accepting their responsibilities.And finally, in relation to what the President was just saying a moment or two ago on Israel and Palestine, I mean, I think that one thing that is very clear is that the old Middle East had within it the origins of all the problems we see. I mean, this terrorist problem that we faced in the last few years, it didn't originate, I'm afraid, a few years ago. It's been building up over decades. It's come out of a series of states of oppression, of warped ideology based on a perverted view of the faith of Islam. This has been building up for a long period of time, and it has basically come out of the Middle East.Now my view in the end is that you go back to the origins of this and say, well, how do we resolve it? And the only way we resolve it is by having the right vision and then the practical measures to achieve it.Now I think the vision is absolutely correct. What we've got to do now—and this is exactly why the President is talking about the way forward—is that we've got to get the right way forward—this is where Baker-Hamilton helped—in order that we have the practical policy that bolsters and gives effect to the vision, because the vision is the right vision. You leave a Middle East in which the Israel-Palestine issue is not solved, in which there's no moves towards democracy, in which Iraq goes back in its old state, in which the Iranian people have no chance to express themselves, maybe not in the months or 1 year, 2 years, but you'll have the same problem. You know, the reason we are faced with this issue is because in the end, everything that happened in that region erupted, in fact, on the streets of New York. But it—the origins of this went way, way back before that.And so it is—there's a tendency, I think, sometimes, to see this as a battle between the idealists on the one hand and the realists on the other. In my view, the only modern form of realism is one that has ideals at the center of it.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Since you brought it up. [Laughter] I think everyone agrees that it has flaws. But Democrats have been sort of reluctant in Congress to reopen the conversation, and Republicans have been more than happy to reopen the conversation, but in a different way. Now that, as you say, it's here to stay, there are so many people that signed up, in this environment, is it possible to do the kind of corrections that the business community and many others would like to see, sort of, small, technical corrections? [SEP] It is absolutely possible, but it will require a change in attitude on the part of the Republicans.I have always said from the outset that on any large piece of legislation like this, there are going to be things that need to be improved, need to be tweaked. I said that, I think, the day I signed the bill. And I don't think there's been any hesitation on our part to consider ideas that would actually improve the legislation. The challenge we have is, is that if you have certain members in the Republican Party whose view is, making it work better is a concession to me, then it's hard in that environment to actually get it done.And I recognize that their party is going through the stages of grief, right? [] Anger and denial and all that stuff—and we're not at acceptance yet. But at some point, my assumption is, is that there will be an interest to figure out how do we make this work in the best way possible.We have 8 million people signed up through the exchanges. That doesn't include the 3 million young people who are able to stay on their parent's plan. It doesn't include the 3 million people who benefited from expansions to Medicaid. So if my math is correct, that's 14 million right there. You've got another 5 million people who signed up outside of the marketplaces, but are part of the same insurance pool. So we've got a sizable part of the U.S. population now that are—in the first—for the first time in many cases, in a position to enjoy the financial security of health insurance.And I'm meeting them as I'm on the road. I met with—I saw a woman yesterday—young woman, maybe 34, with her mom and her dad, and she's got two small kids and self-employed husband and was diagnosed with breast cancer. And this isn't an abstraction to her. She is saving her home. She is saving her business. She is saving her parents' home, potentially, because she's got health insurance, which she just could not afford.And the question now becomes, if, in fact, this is working for a lot of people, but there are still improvements to make, why are we still having a conversation about repealing the whole thing, and why are we having folks say that any efforts to improve it are somehow handing Obama a victory? This isn't about me. And my hope is, is that we start moving beyond that. My suspicion is, that probably will not happen until after November, because it seems as if this is the primary agenda item in the Republican political platform.But here's what I know: The American people would much rather see us talk about jobs, would much rather see us talk about high college costs, would much rather see us discussing how we can rebuild our roads and our bridges and our infrastructure and put people back to work. They'd much rather see us talk about how we'd boost wages and boost incomes and improve their individual family bottom lines.And if the Republicans want to spend the entire next 6 months or year talking about repealing a bill that provides millions of people health insurance without providing any meaningful alternative, instead of wanting to talk about jobs and the economic situation of families all across the country, that's their prerogative. At some point, I think they'll make the transition. That's my hope anyway. If not, we're just going to keep on doing what we're doing, which is making it work for people all across the country.I'm sorry, I'm going to say one last thing about this—[]—just because this does frustrate me: States that have chosen not to expand Medicaid for no other reason than political spite. You've got 5 million people who could be having health insurance right now at no cost to these States—zero cost to these States—other than ideological reasons. They have chosen not to provide health insurance for their citizens. That's wrong. It should stop. Those folks should be able to get health insurance like everybody else.Isaac, from Politico [Edward-Isaac Dovere]. Where are you, Isaac?

Will your timetable be affected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting any indications that Iran is interested in a dialog with the United States? [SEP] I said during the campaign that is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or their financing of terrorist organizations like Hizballah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon, or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon, that all those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace. What I've also said is that we should take an approach with that employs all of the resources at the United States disposal, and that includes diplomacy.And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialog, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is in the coming months we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face, diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction.There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight. And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country: that understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable; that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing.So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility at least of a relationship of mutual respect and progress. And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region.

Should the agreement be modified to address currency manipulation? Additionally, your comments on Mullah Mansur's death, Pakistan's concerns, and whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan would be appreciated. [SEP] On the subject of TPP, my experience in the Senate has taught me that trade agreements are invariably complex, particularly when multiple parties are involved. Every participant seeks the most favorable terms, and in an election year, political considerations often come into play. Nonetheless, I remain confident that we will achieve its passage, as it is the right thing for the country. It is beneficial for both America and the world at large. This region represents the fastest-growing segment of the global economy, offering a significant market opportunity for us. While they benefit from relatively low tariffs on exports to the U.S., our tariffs are comparatively higher. Eliminating 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods entering the world's largest and fastest-growing markets is advantageous for American businesses and workers alike. Historically, trade agreements have exposed us to lower wages and inadequate labor practices. TPP mandates enforceable commitments to improve labor standards and address environmental concerns. I have yet to encounter a persuasive argument suggesting that TPP will have a detrimental impact. We are demonstrably better off with it. The political process will undoubtedly be contentious, as was the case with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian agreements, but we successfully concluded those. Regarding currency manipulation, TPP includes provisions for transparency. Some have advocated for enforceable measures, but it is often difficult to determine manipulation. Binding other nations on monetary policy would also require binding our Federal Reserve, which is not an option. However, we have strengthened provisions to monitor competitive devaluations. Finally, Mansur's death confirms that he was targeting U.S. personnel. This does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not re-engaging in combat operations.

[SEP] Allow me to address your initial question. I'd like to personally contact that family. This administration is committed to supporting them. We abolished the transgender military ban, passed the Respect for Marriage Act, and strengthened LGBT civil rights. The battle, however, is far from over. Some individuals are spreading fear and prejudice. It is wrong to fire someone because of their sexual orientation. It is wrong that acts of violence against LGBTQ individuals are increasing. It is wrong that extremist politicians are targeting transgender children. They are our children and our neighbors. They are all of our children. Our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. We are launching new initiatives to protect the LGBTQ community. We will improve physical security, address civil rights violations, and increase mental health resources. Congress must pass the Equality Act. LGBTQ Americans, especially children, you are loved, you are heard, and this administration supports you. We will not give up. Regarding AI, it offers considerable benefits but also poses genuine dangers. We require safeguards. President Biden and I discussed this in Japan. We are collaborating with other nations on this topic. We have gathered businesses in the United States and the United Kingdom. We require the same amount of urgency as with climate change.

Recent polls show my approval ratings with Hispanics and African Americans are the best they've ever been. These numbers speak for themselves.

And, as you know, I've done more—in fact, if you were with us the last time we met, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, This President has done more for Israel than any other President. Those words. Those exact words.Jerusalem, protection, working together—so many different things. But the big thing is Jerusalem. You know, many, many Presidents have said they are going to build the Embassy in Jerusalem. Never happened. Making it the capital of Israel—never happened. Never happened.

Do you have the feeling that, while in power, you underestimated anger or resentment or fear in America?And to you, Prime Minister Tsipras, President Obama has repeatedly said, including today, that Greece should get substantial debt relief. From your conversation with him today, do you—are you hopeful that he might convince Chancellor Merkel to make a move in that regard later this week? [SEP] No two countries are identical And obviously, there's a difference between a referendum on a very complex relationship between Great Britain and the rest of Europe and a Presidential election in the United States Presidential elections always turn on personalities They turn on how campaigns are run They turn on natural desires for change If you've had an incumbent who has been there for 8 years, there's a temptation to think, well, let's maybe make a change I think there are a whole range of factors involvedBut I do think that there is a common theme that we've seen in a lot of advanced economies and that we've seen around the world, although they manifest themselves in different ways Globalization, combined with technology, combined with social media and constant information, have disrupted people's lives, sometimes in very concrete ways—a manufacturing plant closes, and suddenly, an entire town no longer has what was the primary source of employment—but also psychologically People are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world It starts looking different and disorienting And there is no doubt that that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right, in many countries in Europe When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders—very unconventional candidates—have considerable success, then obviously, there's something there that's being tapped intoA suspicion of globalization, a desire to rein in its excesses, a suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people feel may not be responsive to their immediate needs And that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity And that can be a volatile mixIt's important to recognize, though, that those trends have always been there And it's the job, I think, of leaders to try to address people's real, legitimate concerns and channel them in the most constructive ways possibleDid I recognize that there was anger or frustration in the American population? Of course, I did First of all, we had to fight back from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and I can guarantee you, if your housing values have crashed and you've lost your—most of your pension and you've lost your job, you're going to be pretty angry And so we bought—fought back and recovered But that left, I think, fear and anxiety in a lot of people, a sense that the economy wasn't as certain as it could be, and maybe the game was rigged on Wall Street or by special interests in Washington or what have you And that's been thereI was also aware of it because of the fact that you have seen some of the rhetoric among Republican and elected officials and activists and media—some of it pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts, but being used effectively to mobilize people And obviously, President-elect Trump tapped into that particular strain within the Republican Party and then was able to broaden that enough and get enough votes to win the electionThe lesson I draw—and I think people can draw a lot of lessons, but maybe one that cuts across countries—is, we have to deal with issues like inequality We have to deal with issues of economic dislocation We have to deal with people's fears that their children won't do as well as they have The more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that pit people against each otherAnd frankly, that was—that's been my agenda for the last 8 years I think raising wages, investing in infrastructure, making sure that people have access to good educations that are—equip them for the jobs of the future—those are all agenda items that would help alleviate some of those economic pressures and dislocations that people are experiencing The problem was, I couldn't convince the Republican Congress to pass a lot of themNow, having said that, people seem to think I did a really—pretty good job And so there is this mismatch, I think, between frustration and anger Perhaps the view of the American people was, is that we just need to shake things up Time will now tell whether the prescriptions that are being offered—whether Brexit or with respect to the US election—ends up actually satisfying those people who have been fearful or angry or concerned And I think that's going to be an interesting test, because I think I can make a pretty strong argument that the policies we put forward were the right ones; that we've grown faster than just about any advanced economy The country is indisputably better off, and those folks who voted for the President-elect are better off than they were when I came into office, for the most part But we'll see whether those facts affect people's calculations in the next electionPrime Minister Tsipras You asked if I believe that Angela Merkel could be convinced to make on—but which are the necessary steps for the recovery of the Greek economy Well, my answer is I'm very optimistic, and this for two reasons Number one, Angela Merkel is a German politician, and Germans sometimes insist—sometimes they are disagreeable, but they insist—that the agreements must be honoredAnd what is expected to happen with Greece is that which was agreed last July, August, in the summer of 2015, that was as soon as Greece shows that it has decided to proceed with the courageous and difficult reforms, that when the first and most difficult review is completed, then decisions will be taken, measures will be implemented to reduce—to provide debt relief to Greece so that Greece can go out into the money markets and for growth to return at a very high rate in the Greek economySo the first reason for my optimism is that just as the German Finance Minister used to say, This is a Latin expression, which we sometimes use, where—although we have learned not Latin, but Ancient Greek in our schoolsThe second reason for which I'm optimistic is that I have met Angela Merkel to—in person; so has Barack Obama We worked very close together during the period of the huge refugee crisis Our cooperation is very good, and therefore, I'm of the opinion that she is a responsible politician, a politician who has a sense of responsibility for Europe and not only for Germany or for the—her political party And this was the manner in which she dealt with the refugee crisis: with a deep sense of responsibility on the future of Europe and on stabilityAnd for these two important reasons, I do expect that she will be convinced that these two necessary steps must be made—two steps that will not be a burden to German taxpayers—so that Greece can become not a member—a part of the problem, but a part of the solution for security, for growth, and for resolving the refugee issue, for which Greece plays an important roleAnd that is why I'm optimistic, and I expect my optimism to be realized", "label": "Explicit"}

Well, the legislative process here takes a while. Lawmakers debate things before they figure them out. We haven't really talked seriously about migration until recently. We passed a law in '86, but the real debate started after 2000. As Governor of Texas, I knew this was important and I've been pushing it. Congress is taking it seriously, but it's hard to pass laws on tough issues. A lot of Americans thought we weren't enforcing our laws. We've shown we're serious about the rule of law, so Congress is more open to my idea: migration reform means fewer illegal crossings, better border security, and we can focus on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns. I'm feeling good about it. I don't like to guess about laws, but Congress seems to have gone from skeptical to thinking a big bill is good for the country. Republicans and Democrats are working together in the Senate, and we're helping them. I'm not a betting man, but I'm hopeful we'll get reform. It's good for both countries.

{"sentence": "You mentioned a shift towards decency. Do you believe the election signifies a break from the fever of the past few years? [SEP] I don't think we're going to break the fever for the super-mega-MAGA Republicans. But I think they're a minority of the Republican Party. I think the vast majority of the members of the Republican Party, we disagree strongly on issues, but they're decent, honorable people. We have differences of agreement on issues. But they—you know, I worked with a lot of these folks in the Senate and the House for a long time. And you know, they're honest, and they're straightforward. They're different than mine, but they're—you know, they're decent folks. And so I think that the rest of the world—and a lot of you have covered other parts of the world, and you know—the rest of the world is looking at the United States. I guess the best way to say this is to repeat what you've—some of you've heard me say before. The first G-7 meeting—for the public, that's the seven largest democracies—when I went to—right after we got elected, in February, after I got sworn in in January. And I sat down at a table—a roundtable with the six other world leaders from the European Union, the United—and Canada, et cetera, and said, America is back. And one of them turned to me and said: For how long? For how long? It was a deadly earnest question: For how long? And I looked at them. And then another one went on to say—and I'm not going to name them—went on to say, What would you say, Joe, if in fact you went—we went to bed tonight here in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the Parliament of Great Britain—gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the confirmation of an election? It's not the same situation, obviously, as we have. And he said, What would you think? And what—I ask the rhetorical question: What would you all think? You'd think England was really in trouble. You'd think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain. And so that's the way people were looking at us, like, When is this going to stop? Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don't want to exaggerate. But literally, nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. And so what I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we're about? Are we the same democracy we've always been? Because, look, the rest of the world looks to us—I don't mean that we're always—like we're always right. But if the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change. And so they're very concerned that we are still the open democracy we've been and that we have rules and the institutions matter.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, after five years of war, what lessons have you learned that will guide your final two years in office? [SEP] Absolutely, analyzing what went wrong is crucial for future success. The sectarian violence in Baghdad has been a major setback, causing significant loss of life and displacement. Addressing this violence is a key consideration for our planners. There are two main theaters in Iraq: Baghdad, with its sectarian violence, and the fight against Sunni extremists. We're making progress against the latter, but Baghdad remains a challenge. The attack on the Samarra mosque fueled this sectarian violence. Success requires military, political, and reconstruction efforts. The moderate coalition is a positive step. The oil law is crucial for unifying the country. We're pursuing a parallel strategy, balancing military action with political and reconstruction processes. Prime Minister Maliki's outreach to former Saddam-era generals is a positive sign.

Firstly, I acknowledge that Congress will express its views, and it's no secret that the Democrats, along with some Republicans, are not fans of my decision. That's their prerogative; they're good people with differing opinions. I weighed their arguments but concluded that they wouldn't lead to a stable, self-reliant nation that's a partner in the war on terror. Secondly, my hope is that this symbolic resolution doesn't morph into a binding policy that prevents our troops from carrying out their mission. It's a bit rich to unanimously endorse General Petraeus and then refuse to fund the very strategy he deemed essential before the Senate. I'm going to make it crystal clear to Congress, starting right now, that they need to support our troops financially and give them the leeway they need to get the job done.

News moves fast, so we lose track. It's recent and pervasive, and people are concerned given Paris's similarity to American cities, so I understand the House legislation. I hope now that we've had time to catch our breath, people understand that refugees in the US are the most vetted individuals. The process takes 18-24 months. The House legislation says we can certify, but if it gums up the works, you don't see refugees admitted. If you layer on bureaucracy that doesn't make us safer, you end the refugee program. When I referred to a betrayal of our values, I meant commentary suggesting we let Christians in but not Muslims. Those of you who joined me at the refugee center saw those kids. If you're a parent and saw them, you'd want to find them a home in the US. Most people know we're screening and would say we need to do right by those children. With Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on investigations in the US or foreign countries. But I raised with him, as with other leaders, the importance of transparency, accountability, and rooting out corruption, which impede development. I also emphasized civil society and a free press. Countries are at different stages, and we don't expect everyone to follow the US path. But some principles are important. Myanmar just had a historic election after 40 years of military rule. They won't be Sweden immediately, but there's a sea change. We want to encourage that. The Open Government Partnership, transparency work, and TPP rules are designed to raise the bar. Some will go forward, some will slip back.

{"sentence": "Q. I have a question for the Prime Minister in a moment, if I could. But first, sir, you said just a short time ago that Obamacare is virtually dead. Your plans for Graham-Cassidy have not been able to get off the ground in the Senate. There is no idea whether or not it will in early 2018. You've been picking around the edges, to some degree, with Executive orders, some of which, critics say, are helping to destroy Obamacare. So I'm wondering at this point, what is your health care plan, sir? President Trump. Well, if you look at insurance companies and you take a good, strong look at the numbers, you'll see, since the formation of Obamacare, they're up 400 percent, 450 percent, 250 percent, 300 percent. They've made a fortune, the insurance companies.So when I knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians, I must tell you, that wanted me to continue to pay this, I said I'm not going to do it. This is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. And they've had a record run. They've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate.Obamacare is a disaster. It's virtually dead. As far as I'm concerned, it really is dead, and I predicted that a long time ago. It's a concept that doesn't work. And we are very close.We feel we have the votes, and as soon as we're finished with taxes, John—we really feel we have the votes to get block grants into the States, where the States can much better manage this money and much better take care of the people, rather than the Federal Government. The State block grants—we'll do massive block grants into the various States so that the States can run the program.So we feel we have the votes. We're going to be doing that after the taxes. In the meantime, we're involved with a budget, and then after the budget—hopefully, that gets approved—and after the budget, assuming we have the support of all the Republicans—because we'll have no support from the Democrats or almost no support, because they've really become just obstructionists. They have no good policies, and frankly, they're not good politicians, but they're very good obstructionists. And that's what they do well: obstruct.The number of nominees that I have approved by the Democrats are about half of what President Obama had. And when you look at that—and you can look at judicial appointments, look how slow that's going. I'll have 145 ultimately, which is a tremendous number. We'll have 17 Court of Appeals appointments. But they're not getting approved. They're being slow-walked by Schumer and the group of Democrats that really—it's really disgraceful. Even people that they know they're going to approve, they take it right out to the end. They use every single minute, and I think it's a very disgraceful situation.But Obamacare is everything but dead. The people aren't going to take it. The—they're not going to take it. Alaska, they had over a 200-percent increase. In Arizona, they were 116 percent, and I hear going up even higher. And the people aren't going to take that any longer.So I think we're in great shape.

The Samarra bombing that took place last winter was intended to create sectarian violence, and it has. The recent bombings were to perpetuate the sectarian violence. In other words, we've been in this phase for a while. And the fundamental objective is to work with the Iraqis to create conditions so that the vast majority of the people will be able to see that there's a peaceful way forward.The bombings that took place recently was a part of a pattern that has been going on for about 9 months.

Is it your concern that those deaths are eroding the ability of NATO forces to do their work? [SEP] Let me comment on that real quick. The Taliban likes to surround themselves with innocent civilians. That's their—part of their modus operandi. They don't mind using human shields because they devalue human life. That's why they're willing to kill innocent people to achieve political objectives.And obviously, to the extent that the United States is working with our NATO allies in combat, we care deeply about protecting innocent life. And to those who— Afghans who have lost innocent civilians, we grieve with you. To the Afghan families that have been affected by the Taliban using them as shields, we have great sympathy. We do not have sympathy, however, for the tactics of the Taliban.Now, you asked about Alberto Gonzales. He has got my confidence. He has done nothing wrong. There's been enormous amount of attention on him, that there's been no wrongdoing on his part. He has testified in front of Congress. And I frankly view what's taking place in Washington today as pure political theater. And it is the—this kind of political theater that has caused the American people to lose confidence in how Washington operates.I stand by Al Gonzales, and I would hope that people would be more sober in how they address these important issues. And they ought to get the job done of passing legislation, as opposed to figuring out how to be actors on the political theater stage. Let me add that—I'll stress again, like the President did—of course, every innocent civilian fatality, death, is one too many. But in a conflict, it is from time to time unavoidable, dramatically, but unavoidable. NATO and ISAF forces still have the support of the large majority of the Afghan people.I had a long telephone conversation with President Karzai a few days ago on this subject. We'll avoid it. Our military commanders are doing everything they can. NATO, ISAF forces, and coalition forces are doing everything they can. But the President talked about Taliban tactics; we are in a different moral category. We'll be there; we'll try to, as quickly as possible, bring in, also finance, to see that these people can build up their lives again. And we'll do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties.But I think if you talk about and ask me about the hearts and minds in Afghanistan, we still have very much the hearts and minds of the Afghan people, because they do see that their nation, their own nation, has no future under Taliban rule. And I only have to refer to the kinds and type of Afghanistan we saw—you and I saw—under Taliban rule, a regime with the most gross human rights violations the world has seen.Thank you.

That's a win against terror because those radicals hate free societies. Musharraf did what he said he would: elections, no more emergency rule. Now it's up to the new guys to be our friends. We see Pakistan as a key ally with shared goals, like stopping radicals and preventing attacks on both our countries. As for America and Africa lining up, of course. The U.S. is a melting pot, and African Americans are a big part of our country. They should want to help Africa. We're all connected now. Problems spread fast.

So what would be your cautionary tale to your successor about the threat Russia poses and how to deal with this new leader? [SEP] I don't know much about Medvedev either. And what will be interesting to see is who comes to the—who represents Russia at the G-8, for example. It will be interesting to see—it will help, I think, give some insight as to how Russia intends to conduct foreign policy over— after Vladimir Putin's Presidency. And I can't answer the question yet.I can say that it's in our interests to continue to have relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation matters, it's in our interest to be able to make sure that materials that could cause great harm aren't proliferated. It's in our interest to work together on Iran. As I said, I think, in this room the last time I was here, I appreciated the fact that Vladimir Putin told the Iranians that they will provide—they, Russia—will provide enriched uranium to run the Bushehr power plant, thereby negating the need for the Iranians to enrich in the first place. I thought that was a constructive suggestion. And we need to be in a position to be able to work with Russia on Iran.There's a lot of areas where—yesterday, for example, with the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, I talked about a missile defense system in Europe. But I believe it's in our interests to try to figure out a way for the Russians to understand the system is not aimed at them but aimed at the real threats of the 21st century, which could be a launch from a violent regime—a launch of a weapon of mass destruction.So there's areas, David [David Gregory, NBC News], where we need to cooperate and—let me finish—and so it's a—I'm going to try to leave it so whoever my successor is will be able to have a relationship with whoever is running foreign policy in Russia. It's just—it's in the country's interest. That doesn't mean we have to agree all the time. I mean, obviously, we didn't agree on Kosovo. There will be other areas where we don't agree.

They run—they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense.

Is this a result of adopting President Trump's approach, or were you unable to sway him? And do you believe the other signatories will support this new direction? [SEP] Let me clarify: my 'no Plan B' comment referred to the lack of a second planet, a comment about climate change, not Iran. Regarding Iran, my position has been consistent. As I stated at the UN, the JCPOA needs to be supplemented with elements addressing post-2025 issues, ballistic missiles, and regional influence. The JCPOA's fate is uncertain, and that's his decision. I view it as a foundation, not the complete solution. I'm not suggesting a replacement, but an enhancement. I wouldn't be as critical of the JCPOA as he is, because I think we can usefully add to it. Regardless, my goal is to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement encompassing the JCPOA's provisions, extended nuclear restrictions, ballistic missile controls, and regional influence mitigation. We've discussed regional dynamics, especially in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, recognizing the interconnectedness of nuclear and ballistic issues, and Iran's regional presence. Our shared aim is regional stability. This agreement sets the stage for a new agreement addressing the Syrian conflict. I hope to work with our partners, and our foreign ministers are actively involved. We will also discuss regional issues, including Syria, with Russia and Turkey. I believe we can reconcile our common ground and differences. Abandoning the JCPOA without a replacement would be a mistake. Instead, we should build upon it to address all concerns. This acknowledges the criticisms of the JCPOA, which was supported by previous administrations. It also respects regional sovereignty, focusing on a stable framework for peace. It's not about tearing about an agreement and have nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns. And if I might add, they—states and, as I alluded to—that—and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost. The United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before—and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to—$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, Oh, we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things—tunnels, bridges—they say, Oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period. The countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important—because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that.

Europe has been kicking the can down the road for years, so why are you any more convinced that we won't see another 3-month fix emerge out of Brussels at the end of the month?

{"sentence": "Q. Yes, sir. Thank you. One reason the Republicans talk about it is, there are people who object to the law who said they've had problems with the law, and there are a significant number of opponents of the law. I guess my question is, what makes you think a significant majority of the American people, of voters, will accept this law? Or are we destined to see health care as a 50/50, red State/blue State argument for years to come? [SEP] Well, I think you're mixing up two things here, David. You said there are people who have seen problems with the law. That's not 50 percent of the American people. Right? There may have been folks who have been affected in ways that they weren't happy about by the law. That is a fall—far smaller number than the millions of people who've been signed up. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned about it. That's an area where, as I said to Tamara, we should be open to, are there ways that we can make it even better? So that's objective facts and real problems out there.The other side of it is just polling, right, what's the general opinion of the law, which is attached to general opinions about me or about Democrats and partisanship in the country generally.My view is that the longer we see the law benefiting millions of people, the more we see accusations that the law is hurting millions of people being completely debunked, as some of you in the press have done, and the more the average American who already has health insurance sees that it's actually not affecting them in an adverse way, then it becomes less of a political football, which is where I want it to be. This shouldn't be a political football. This should be something that we take for granted, that in this country, you should be able to get affordable health care regardless of how wealthy you are.Now, the larger issue about whether we can move past the polarization and, sort of, the bitter political debates between Democrats and Republicans, of which Obamacare is just one small part, that's going to take more time. But it's not for lack of trying on my part. And I think that I speak for all Democrats in saying, we would much prefer a constructive conversation with the Republicans about how do we get some stuff done, and let's focus on some areas that the American people really care about.On jobs, we know that infrastructure would put people back to work right now and it would improve our economy for the long term. It didn't used to be a partisan issue. Why aren't we coming up with a way to make sure that we're rebuilding our roads and our bridges and improving our air traffic control system? There's no reason that has to be political. There really isn't any ideological disagreement on that.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with all due respect, haven't you alienated your base by flip-flopping on tax increases, particularly concerning Social Security? And frankly, the negotiations appear to be deadlocked. Can you give us an honest assessment: are we headed for a fiscal disaster? [SEP] Let's be absolutely clear: a disaster is avoidable if everyone comes to the table in good faith. I campaigned on a balanced approach, and that's exactly what I'm pushing for. The wealthiest Americans need to pay their fair share, we need to make responsible cuts, and we absolutely cannot leave vulnerable families behind. My proposal reflects that balance. I'm prepared to make difficult concessions, even those that may not be popular with some in my own party, to reach a compromise. We need a solution that garners bipartisan support to stabilize our economy and safeguard the middle class. I've already gone more than halfway to address Republican concerns, despite the fact that the majority of Americans agree with me that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest to reduce the deficit. The fact that Speaker Boehner hasn't embraced what I believe is a fair deal is, frankly, baffling. I remain optimistic, but ultimately, Congress must do its job. The framework for a deal is there, but it requires compromise from all sides. Voters are demanding compromise, not partisan obstruction. We need to act in the best interests of the nation, particularly in light of recent tragedies. I'm committed to getting a deal done before Christmas, but it will require adjustments from everyone involved. The Speaker's 'Plan B', which provides tax breaks to millionaires while cutting unemployment benefits, is a clear violation of the principles we debated during the election. My hope is that Congress will ensure that middle-class taxes do not increase, protect vital programs like tax credits for college, and agree to a balanced deficit reduction package, which is precisely what I have put forward.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. It was about: Is the new Washington consensus that you and your National Security Adviser set out simply another way of saying America first, which some overseas think it is? [SEP] Well, look, my economic policy is totally consistent with what I think is in the interest of our NATO allies and our allies around the world.One of the things that I decided to do—and I find that the Wall Street Journal—and I'm sure there is someone here from the Wall Street Journal and other publications that are talking about Bidenomics. I didn't realize it was—I had Bidenomics going.But the bottom line was this: that the fundamental changes taking place in terms of international trade, nobody in—at least very few people in United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what a supply chain meant, what they're talking about, the supply chain.When we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles was because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic, we realized that—I decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth.And I made it clear to all our NATO allies and our partners as well that although we were going to generate a—for example, an AI capacity here—I mean, excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States, attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment, that that was available to all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as they—as we are and benefiting in a similar way.The bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle-down economics, where if the—if the trickle-down economics resulted in both—in Democratic and Republican administrations for generations—in making sure we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product to—sent the work to those—to that neighbor or those neighbors who have the cheapest labor, and they send back their products.Well, I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacity—here in the United States, we're attracting capacity to build here in the United States to send product overseas, not the reverse.And I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. Matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home, they're doing similar things.So that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materials—the battery technologies—to share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us.So it is increasing trade. But right now it looks like it is—because the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it looks like it's only the United States. It's not. It's just a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth. And just to add to that, I'd say I'm absolutely of the view that the United States, this President does not believe in zero-sum competition amongst allies. That's what we declared together with our G-7 partners just a few weeks ago in Hiroshima. This is a President and an administration that is completely attuned to the needs and concerns of its allies on these issues. And you can see that.Today, as the President said, we are launching negotiations between the U.K. and the U.S. on a critical minerals agreement so that the U.S. can provide us with that interaction and cooperation we need.And the Atlantic Declaration that we've announced today just talks about strengthening, deepening our cooperation. It's not about looking in and being protection; it's about the exact opposite of that.And it's about strengthening that cooperation across the full spectrum of economic, technological, and other spheres. And that's what you will see. You'll see that from the President. You'll see it from me. You'll see the U.K. and the U.S. working even more closely together on all the big economic issues of our time, because that's what the moment demands, and that's what our citizens need us to do. And that's what the President and I plan to deliver. And it's not just our citizens. Look, the Global South—there are going to be a billion people in Africa very shortly. One billion.At the G-7, it was originally called Build Back Better World, but we were talking about—there's a new PPI [PGII; White House correction]—anyway—an industrial policy that we're all signed on to, to provide the countries in Africa and in the Global South an opportunity to grow, significantly grow, which benefits the United States, benefits Europe, benefits every country.Because the reverse is true: If we don't figure a way in which these countries can grow and participate and have to—and be able to build infrastructure—you know, the Canadians—the—excuse me, the Chinese have a Belt and Road Initiative. Well, the Belt and Road Initiative turns out to be a debt and confiscation program. Not going very far.But what we're doing—and we're going to be doing with our NATO allies, with the G-7—is providing opportunities. For example, Angola—I—should be in a position very soon to have the largest solar facility in the world, generating significant amounts of energy. It benefits us, benefits them, brings them into the 21st century in a way that they'd never been before.We're talking about building—and I had my team putting together with other countries as well—to build a railroad from the Pacific Ocean—from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Indian Ocean. Never occurred before. How—we're—our Departments of Agriculture are working with these countries.So there's a significant amount of cooperation, not to hoard capacity, but to expand capacity to further expand opportunity, because we all benefit from it.And one thing I've learned is that we are not going to be able to deal with the global warming, which is a consequential—single most consequential threat to humanity if we don't do it, unless we engage more together, not fewer—not less together.And so the United States will do what it can do well and invite all of our partners to be part of it if we can.Thank you.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Many experts, from Nouriel Roubini to Senator Schumer, have said that it will cost the Government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, you promised the American people that you won't just tell them what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the Government need far more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue funds to really solve the credit crisis? [SEP] Well, the credit crisis is real and it's not over. We averted catastrophe by passing the TARP legislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistency in how it was applied, a lack of oversight in how the money went out, we didn't get as big of a bang for the buck as we should have.My immediate task is making sure that the second half of that money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my first job. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is to make sure that my Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, working with Larry Summers, my National Economic Adviser, and others, are coming up with the best possible plan to use this money wisely--in a way that's transparent; in a way that provides clear oversight; that we are conditioning any money that we give to banks on them reducing executive compensation to reasonable levels; and to make sure that they're not wasting that money.We are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restored within the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is that nobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank, they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open things up and restore some trust.We also have to deal with the housing issue in a clear and consistent way. I don't want to preempt my Secretary of the Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been, let's get this right, let's create a template in which we're restoring market confidence. And the reason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we're going to need additional money or how much additional money we'll need until we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidence in the marketplace, that the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing. That can make a big difference in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace.And ultimately, the Government cannot substitute for all the private capital that has been withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence so that private capital goes back in.Okay. Jake [Jake Tapper, ABC News].", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, on the fiscal cliff, 2 years ago, sir, you said that you wouldn't extend the Bush-era tax cuts, but at the end of the day, you did. So, respectfully, sir, why should the American people and the Republicans believe that you won't cave again this time? [SEP] Well, 2 years ago, the economy was in a different situation. We were still very much in the early parts of recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And ultimately, we came together not only to extend the Bush tax cuts, but also a wide range of policies that were going to be good for the economy at that point—unemployment insurance extensions, payroll tax extension—all of which made a difference and is part of the reason why what we've seen now is 32 consecutive months of job growth and over 5 1/2 million jobs created and the unemployment rate coming down.But what I said at the time is what I meant, which is this was a one-time proposition. And what I have told leaders privately, as well as publicly, is that we cannot afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. What we can do is make sure that middle class taxes don't go up.And so the most important step we can take right now—and I think the foundation for a deal that helps the economy, creates jobs, gives consumers certainty, which means gives businesses confidence that they're going to have consumers during the holiday season—is if we right away say 98 percent of Americans are not going to see their taxes go up, 97 percent of small businesses are not going to see their taxes go up. If we get that in place, we are actually removing half of the fiscal cliff. Half of the danger to our economy is removed by that single step.And what we can then do is shape a process whereby we look at tax reform, which I'm very eager to do. I think we can simplify our tax system. I think we can make it more efficient. We can eliminate loopholes and deductions that have a distorting effect on our economy. I believe that we have to continue to take a serious look at how we reform our entitlements because health care costs continue to be the biggest driver of our deficits.So there is a package to be shaped, and I'm confident that parties—folks of good will in both parties can make that happen.

Florida has been working on this for years. And they have a very good system of mail-in—and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify.They're so well run. Florida is a very well-run State: low taxes, low everything.

And the two Governors, between the both of them, they've really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the—even in the case of mail-in ballots, the postal services have built up their—you know, it takes a long time.When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they—and I'll give you the story: I think you have to do that election over.

[SEP] Well, keep in mind the drawdown hasn't begun. So we understood that is a dangerous place, that the Taliban is still active, and that there are still going to be events like this on occasion. The question is, in terms of overall trend, is Afghan capacity increasing?Kabul, for example, which contains a huge proportion of the Afghan population as a whole, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time. And they've done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were.That doesn't mean that there are not going to be events like this potentially taking place, and that will probably go on for some time. Our work is not done. But as I said in my speech, the tide of war is receding. We have shifted to a transition phase. And much like we've seen in Iraq--where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder of our troops will be coming out by the end of this year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and to tamp down violence there--we think a similar approach makes sense in .But even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with the clock ticking down on your presidency, what are your remaining priorities, and are you concerned that the immigration bill might become a casualty of the upcoming elections? [SEP] Look, we've got to get that energy legislation across the finish line. Renewing No Child Left Behind is non-negotiable. Those trade agreements with Panama, Peru, and Colombia need to move through Congress, and I'm hoping we can build on the progress we've made with the Korean free trade agreement. My goal is to bring back successful Doha negotiations for a congressional vote, which means we need a TPA extension. And we absolutely must keep the momentum going on balancing the budget. The deficit's shrinking faster than anticipated, thanks to increased tax revenues and the measures we've put in place. Now, we need Congress to hold the line on spending and avoid those tax hikes that would cripple the economy and, in turn, hurt Treasury revenues. I'm deeply concerned about the Democrats' tax-and-spend approach. I'm waiting to see how they plan to balance the budget in five years. And, of course, the war on terror remains a central focus. I'm hoping to find common ground with both parties on Iraq. Some just want to pull out, but I strongly disagree, and I believe most Americans do as well. The recent vote showed what we can achieve when we work together. On immigration, it's a complex issue. I've always been a proponent of comprehensive reform to secure our border. It's a promise I made on the campaign trail, and it's something I believed in as Governor of Texas. I understand the frustrations surrounding illegal immigration, which is why we've significantly ramped up border security. We're doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and adding more fencing and equipment. I even deployed the National Guard for a while. This bill addresses those concerns by setting clear security benchmarks that must be met before any other reforms can take effect. Last year, the call was for security first, and that's precisely what this bill delivers. However, I don't see how we can achieve the level of border security the American people expect without a temporary-worker program that includes verifiable work cards. People will come here to work, and they'll find a way to do it. This has fueled an underground industry of smugglers and document forgers, which is simply inhumane. It's not who we are as Americans. The best way to combat this is to offer a legal, temporary pathway for people to fill jobs that Americans aren't doing. I'd much rather have people crossing the border with legitimate cards than being crammed into the back of a truck. Secondly, we need a reliable system for employer verification. It's against the law to hire someone who's here illegally, but businesses often struggle to verify the authenticity of documents. That's why we need a tamper-proof ID card, which is a key component of this bill. The toughest question is what to do with those who are already here. Some would call anything short of deportation amnesty, but deporting 12 million people is simply not realistic. Nor should they be granted automatic citizenship. So, we've developed a plan that requires them to meet certain conditions to obtain a Z visa, including background checks, fines, and a probationary period, before they can even apply for citizenship. If you're looking for reasons to oppose the bill, you'll find them, but it's a comprehensive and well-thought-out solution. I knew this would be a contentious issue. It's easy to demonize someone who's working hard here. I want to get this bill done because it's the right thing to do and because it will address the problem effectively. I want to take it out of the political arena. Immigration debates can bring out the worst in people. We're a nation of immigrants.

You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along.When I came along, I said: Wait a minute. We're protecting Germany from Russia, right? NATO. We're protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy. And the real number is, probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the—what we've done for Ukraine, relative to what the past—they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected.And I said: Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we're protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work? And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent, because they're only paying a little more than 1 percent and they're supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump—me—I got the countries of NATO to spend one point—$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO.And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess—and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.But I'm the one that did that. So—but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2.The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don't know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They're closing all their plants. They're closing their nuclear. They're closing their coal. They're closing a lot of plants. And they are—they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position.Yes, please.News Media/Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly  Q. Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason's [Jeff Mason, Reuters] question?

We're urging both sides to talk, to prevent any further escalation. The key here is to get everyone focused on the real enemy: ISIS.

And by any measure, by any traditional calculation, by the measures that Republicans themselves have used in the past, this would be as large a piece of deficit reduction as we've seen in the last 20 years. And if you combine that with the increased revenue from the wealthy paying a little bit more, then you actually have something that would stabilize our deficit and debt for a decade—for 10 years.Now, the notion that we would not do that, but instead the Speaker would run a play that cuts—keeps tax cuts for folks making 500 or 700 or 800 or $900,000 a year and gives more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and raises taxes on middle class families and then has no cuts in it—which is what he says he wants—doesn't make much sense.I mean, let's just think about the logic for a second. They're thinking about voting for raising taxes, at least on folks over a million, which they say they don't want to do, but they're going to reject spending cuts that they say they do want to do. That defies logic. There's no explanation for that.I think that any objective person out there looking would say that we've put forward a very balanced plan and it's time for us to go ahead and get it done. That's what the country needs right now.

So why are you now selecting the Vice President to run point on this? [SEP] Well, Mike is not a czar. He's Vice President. He's in the administration. But I'm having everybody report to Mike. Mike has been very good, very adept. Anybody that knows anything about health care, they look at the Indiana model, and it's been a very great success. It's been a tremendous model in terms of health care. And this is really an offshoot of that.So this isn't a czar. I don't view Mike as a czar. Mike is part of the administration.

As for my successor, they'll need to navigate a complex relationship. We need Russia on board with things like non-proliferation and Iran. Remember when Putin offered to supply enriched uranium to Iran, removing their need to enrich it themselves? That was constructive. Missile defense in Europe is another area where we need to find common ground. Ultimately, it's in our national interest to maintain a working relationship, even if we disagree, like on Kosovo.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you've been a strong advocate for equality and opportunity. However, with the change in administration, many fear a rollback of these gains. Reflecting on your commitment to closing the gaps, what are the most pressing rights issues that remain unresolved? What role do you envision playing in addressing these issues after your presidency? And, as the first African American President, what are your thoughts on the prospect of another Black President in the future? [SEP] Well, let me start with that last question. I am absolutely certain that we will continue to see talented individuals from every walk of life rise to positions of leadership in this country. That's what makes America so strong – when everyone has a fair shot at success. I've often used the analogy of our Olympic teams. Their incredible diversity is a testament to our nation's potential. You see athletes of all shapes, sizes, and colors achieving greatness. This genetic diversity is a tremendous asset. Just look at Simone Biles and Michael Phelps – vastly different individuals, yet both champions in their respective fields. And it's worth noting that women consistently win a significant portion of our medals, a direct result of Title IX, which has provided them with unparalleled opportunities in sports.So, if we remain committed to ensuring equal opportunity for all, I have no doubt that we will see a woman President, a Latino President, a Jewish President, a Hindu President – the possibilities are endless. Perhaps even a President of mixed heritage that defies easy categorization. That's perfectly fine.As for my concerns, I addressed many of these in my Farewell Address, so I won't reiterate them all here. However, inequality remains a significant challenge. If we fail to invest in ensuring that everyone can participate fully in the economy, we risk hindering economic growth and exacerbating divisions among Americans, not just along racial lines. Many individuals voted for the President-elect because they feel marginalized and forgotten, believing that their children will not have the same opportunities they once had.We must avoid a situation where a small elite thrives while the majority struggles for scraps. This breeds resentment and can amplify racial tensions, as people begin to believe that the only way to advance is by taking something from someone else who looks or worships differently. This is not a recipe for a healthy democracy.I am also deeply concerned about the fundamental mechanisms of our democracy. We stand alone among advanced nations in making it more difficult, rather than easier, to vote. This has a long and troubling history that we must confront honestly.", "label": "Dodging"}

Have you advised your successor on the importance of selecting qualified staff? And in your final weeks in office, is there anything you can do to stop the bombing of Aleppo? Chancellor Merkel, given the differing opinions on Trump, what is your message to the American people? [SEP] Well, a fundamental aspect of our democracy is the right to protest. I've been the subject of protests during my time in office, as have many presidents before me. So, I wouldn't tell people who feel strongly about the issues raised during the campaign to be silent. What I would advise, and have advised, is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matters. I consistently tell young people, both in the U.S. and abroad, don't take our systems of government and way of life for granted. Because we've lived in a relatively stable and peaceful era, with improving living standards, there's a tendency to assume it will always be this way. But it's not. Democracy is hard work. In the U.S., if 43 percent of eligible voters don't vote, democracy is weakened. If we're not serious about facts, especially in an age of social media where information is consumed in soundbites, if we can't distinguish between serious arguments and propaganda, we have problems. If people, regardless of their political leanings, are unwilling to compromise and demonize opponents, democracy will break down. So, my advice is to understand the foundations of a healthy democracy and how to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us or during an election. It's hard work. The good news is, many young people who were involved in my campaigns continue to be involved in work, both politically and through nonprofits, that can carry this hard work forward. But there's sometimes complacency. Here in Europe, many young people forget the Cold War and the significance of the Berlin Wall. And I'll be honest, I've heard rhetoric in Europe that draws a false equivalence between the U.S. and Russia, and between how our governments operate versus other governments. Those distinctions are important. I've said many times that, like any government, we have flaws, we've operated imperfectly, we've made mistakes. There are times when I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned with our values. It's a work of constant improvement. But I can say to the German people that the U.S. has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And across Europe, many principles taken for granted here – free speech, civil liberties, an independent judiciary, and fighting corruption – are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we've tried to apply not just in our own country, but also in our foreign policy. That should be remembered. Because in an age of active misinformation, packaged attractively and appearing the same on Facebook or TV, where overzealousness by a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems the same and no distinctions are made, we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of democratic freedoms, market-based economies, and prosperity that we've come to take for granted. That was a rather lengthy response, wasn't it? I seem to have lost track of the initial question.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering your successor's recent communications with Taiwan's leader and his subsequent remarks about the 'One China' policy, coupled with escalating tensions and China's actions in the South China Sea, do you believe a reassessment of our China strategy is warranted? What are your thoughts on the implications of a phone call with the Taiwanese President, and are you concerned that such unconventional tactics could escalate into conflict with our primary geopolitical competitor? [SEP] Well, that's a great question. I'm somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I think one of the—I've said this before—I am very proud of the work I've done. I think I'm a better President now than when I started. But if you're here for 8 years in the bubble, you start seeing things a certain way, and you benefit from—the democracy benefits, America benefits from some new perspectives. And I think it should be not just the prerogative, but the obligation of a new President, to examine everything that's been done and see what makes sense and what doesn't. That's what I did when I came in, and I'm assuming any new President is going to undertake those same exercises. And given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake in terms of the world economy, national security, our presence in the Asia-Pacific, China's increasing role in international affairs—there's probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and where there's also the potential if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full-conflict mode, that everybody is worse off. So I think it's fine for him to take a look at it. What I've advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you're doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. And since there's only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on what's gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what we've learned from 8 years of experience, so that as he's then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he's got all the information to make good decisions and, by the way, that all of Government is moving at the same time and singing from the same hymnal. And with respect to China—and let's just take the example of Taiwan—there has been a longstanding agreement, essentially, between China, the United States, and to some degree, the Taiwanese, which is to not change the status quo. Taiwan operates differently than mainline—mainland China does. China views Taiwan as part of China, but recognizes that it has to approach Taiwan as an entity that has its own ways of doing things. The Taiwanese have agreed that as long as they're able to continue to function with some degree of autonomy, that they won't charge forward and declare independence. And that status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful and—economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination. But understand, for China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation. And so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what are the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they'll treat some other issues. They won't even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we've had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves. And their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant. That doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past. It does mean that you've got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in. All right. Isaac Dovere of Politico.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, you mentioned the prospect that your successor would be dealing with the war. You'll be making your first trip to Vietnam in roughly a week. Some people are still—are looking at the war as another Vietnam war. Are they wrong to do so? And if so, why? [SEP] I think they are. I think they are. First of all, Iraq is—after the overthrow of the tyrant, voted on a Constitution that is intended to unite the whole country. And then they had elections under that Constitution, where nearly 12 million people voted for this unity Government. Secondly—which is different from Vietnam.Secondly, in terms of our troops, this is a volunteer army. Vietnam wasn't a volunteer army, as you know. And in this Volunteer Army, the troops understand the consequences of Iraq and the global war on terror. That's why reenlistment rates are up, and that's why enlistment is high.Thirdly, the support for our troops is strong here in the United States, and it wasn't during the Vietnam era. So I see differences; I really do. And you hear all the time, Well, this may be a civil war. Well, I don't believe it is, and the Maliki Government doesn't believe it is. Zal, our Ambassador, doesn't believe it is.

I recognize there are people in Congress that say we shouldn't have been there in the first place. But it sounds to me as if the debate has shifted, that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker's testimony made a difference to a lot of Members. I hope we continue to find ground by making sure our troops get funded. We found common ground on FISA. My only question is, why change a good law? The way that law was written works for the security of the country. That's what the American people want to know, by the way. Are we passing laws that are beneficial to the American people? This law is beneficial because it enables our intelligence experts to find out the intentions of Al Qaida. Now, the law needs to be changed, enhanced by providing the phone companies that allegedly helped us with liability protection. So we found common ground there. Hopefully, we can find common ground as the Congress begins to move pieces of legislation. The reason I said what I said today is, there's a lot to be done. As you recognize, I'm not a member of the legislative branch; probably wouldn't be a very good legislator. But as the head of the executive branch, it makes sense to call upon Congress to show progress and get results. It's hard to find common ground unless important bills are moving. They're not even moving. And not one appropriations bill has made it to my desk. How can you find common ground when there's no appropriations process? We found common ground on a trade bill--trade bills, really important pieces of legislation, as far as I'm concerned. One of the reasons why is, exports helped us overcome the weakness in the housing market last quarter. If that's the case, it seems like it makes sense to continue and open up markets to goods and services. And yet there hadn't been one--there haven't been any bills moving when it comes to trade. Veterans Affairs is an area where we can find common ground. I've called in--I asked Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead an important Commission, a Commission to make sure our veterans get the benefits they deserve. I was concerned about bureaucratic delay and the--concerned about a system that had been in place for years, but this didn't recognize this different nature--a different kind of war that we're fighting. I don't like it when I meet wives who are sitting by--beside their husbands' bed in Walter Reed and not being supported by its Government, not being helped to provide care.

Hey, look, I have often said that history will look back and determine that which could have been done better, or you know, mistakes I made. Clearly, putting a Mission Accomplished on a aircraft carrier was a mistake. It sent the wrong message. We were trying to say something differently, but nevertheless, it conveyed a different message. Obviously, some of my rhetoric has been a mistake.I've thought long and hard about Katrina, you know, could I have done something differently, like land Air Force One either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge. The problem with that and—is that law enforcement would have been pulled away from the mission. And then your questions, I suspect, would have been, How could you possibly have flown Air Force One into Baton Rouge, and police officers that were needed to expedite traffic out of New Orleans were taken off the task to look after you?I believe that running the Social Security idea right after the '04 elections was a mistake. I should have argued for immigration reform. And the reason why is, is that— you know, one of the lessons I learned as Governor of Texas, by the way, is legislative branches tend to be risk averse. In other words, sometimes legislatures have the tendency to ask, Why should I take on a hard task when a crisis is not imminent? And the crisis was not imminent for Social Security, as far as many Members of Congress was concerned.As an aside, one thing I proved is that you can actually campaign on the issue and get elected. In other words, I don't believe talking about Social Security is the third rail of American politics. I, matter of fact, think that in the future, not talking about how you intend to fix Social Security is going to be the third rail of American politics.And the one thing about the Presidency is that you can make—only make decisions, you know, on the information at hand. You don't get to have information after you've made the decision. That's not the way it works. And you stand by your decisions, and you do your best to explain why you made the decisions you made.There have been disappointments. Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment during the Presidency. Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment. I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but they were—things didn't go according to plan, let's put it that way.And anyway, I think historians will look back, and they'll be able to have a better look at mistakes after some time has passed.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You noted your disappointment with Chinese actions on climate in Rome and also the lack of willingness for Chinese President Xi Jinping to show up at either the G-20 or COP26.But I wanted to ask more broadly: When you assess where things stand right now in U.S.-China relationships after your first 10 months in office—your diplomats have had difficulty engaging in a substantive manner with some of their counterparts; you have a Chinese military that has tested a hypersonic missile this summer and is building its nuclear capability—what is your general assessment of where things stand? And are you concerned that the potential for armed conflict has grown over the course of your first 10 months in office? [SEP] Well, let me start off by addressing the first part of—if not the question, the statement. And that is that I indicated that China and Russia not showing up—and Saudi Arabia—was a problem. We showed up. We showed up. And by showing up, we've had a profound impact on the way I think the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role.I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China—with respect to China not showing up. The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, What value added are they providing? And they've lost an ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP—the same way, I would argue, with regard to Russia.With regard to the more profound question about do I—am I worried about an armed conflict or some—that accidentally occurring with China: No, I'm not. But I have had, as I've said before—and I think we've talked about this, Phil, but I may be mistaken—that I think, as I've said, I look at China—and I've had hours of conversations with Xi Jinping, both in person when I was Vice President and since I've been President, at least 5 or 6 hours' worth of conversations on the telephone, and I'm going to be having a virtual summit with him—I've made it clear: This does—this is competition; it does not have to be conflict. There is no reason there needs to be conflict.But I've also indicated to him, and I've—so I don't—I'm not reluctant to say it publicly—that we expect him to play by the rules of the road. We're not going to change our attitude toward what constitutes international airspace, international sea lanes, et cetera.We also have made it clear that we have to work on dealing with things like cybersecurity and a whole range of other issues. But I'm not looking for, I don't anticipate there will be a need for—to be—there be physical conflict. But you know, as you've heard me say this before—my dad had an expression. He'd say, The only conflict worse than the one that's intended is one that's unintended—one that's unintended.And so, in my meetings with him virtually coming up—we haven't set the exact date yet—I want to make sure there's no misunderstanding. It's competition, not conflict. And so there's no—no unintended.Yes, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].", "label": "Explicit"}

But getting things done requires bipartisan cooperation, which the elections showed. We've had a pretty successful few years legislatively. We reformed Medicare, created tax policies that encourage economic growth, passed trade deals, and a comprehensive energy bill. I'm signing another energy bill today, extending tax credits for R&D. It's a substantial record. However, with the Democrats now in charge, we need a different approach. I'll work with their leaders and our own to find common ground on Social Security and immigration. We absolutely must pass comprehensive immigration reform this year. To secure our border, Border Patrol needs a plan allowing temporary legal work for those doing jobs Americans won't. Recent enforcement actions at packing plants showed many illegal workers using forged documents. This system forces people to rely on smugglers and forgers. It's inhumane. The best way to enforce our borders humanely is with comprehensive reform. I've proposed a plan and spoken about it from the Oval Office. The 'microphone' is necessary to call people to action. I want to work with both Republicans and Democrats. On energy, we can also cooperate. There's consensus on researching alternative energy. We're making progress. I'm looking forward to working with them. Some say losing Congress means nothing will get done. I disagree. I want to get things done, and the Democratic leaders want to prove their leadership. We can find common ground without compromising principles. The American people are tired of the partisanship and name-calling. I'll do my part to elevate the tone.

We're collaborating with Egypt to halt the flow of arms into Gaza, which enables Hamas's attacks. Nations providing weapons to Hamas must stop, and the international community must exert pressure.

Furthermore, why the avoidance of the term 'stimulus' when discussing infrastructure spending, considering the unpopularity of the original stimulus package? [SEP] When I first entered office, we faced an economy on the verge of collapse. We implemented a plan that economists widely agree averted a depression. A third of that plan involved tax cuts. We haven't waited until now to take action. We've enacted tax cuts for small businesses eight times in the last 18 months. These actions have made a tangible difference. Three million individuals have jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. The economy would be in a significantly worse condition. However, we're not yet where we need to be. Therefore, what additional steps can we take? Our proposals have historically enjoyed bipartisan support: a research and development tax credit, accelerated business depreciation. Regarding infrastructure, we're expanding the highway bill. We're rebuilding America. We'll fund these initiatives by ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. These are commonsense approaches. Historically, Republicans and Democrats have found common ground on infrastructure and R&D. Let's move forward. It's not that the previous stimulus was ineffective.

{"sentence": "Are you facing a deadline from Congress this fall regarding the war? [SEP] I appreciate the Members coming to the White House for a good exchange. I shared my feelings about the Iraqi issue, discussing the implications of both failure and success. They expressed their concerns about the Iraq war, which are widely shared. I reminded them that last fall, polls showed widespread disapproval of the situation in Iraq. I, too, would have disapproved at that time. That's why I implemented a plan to improve the situation. I explained my decision-making process and emphasized that General Petraeus has a plan that some Members of Congress are hindering. It's illogical to unanimously confirm him and then deny him the resources needed to succeed. We must give General Petraeus a chance. He will report back to the Secretary, the Joint Chiefs, the White House, and Congress on the effectiveness of the strategy. We will then respond accordingly. Decisions about our posture in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, and General Petraeus is best suited to assess those conditions. Upon his recommendation, along with the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs, we will respond. Let's wait and see what happens and give this plan a chance to work. Let's avoid playing politics and support our troops. It's one thing to have an honest debate about Iraq, but it's another to involve our troops in that debate. They deserve the necessary funding and flexibility. This cause is necessary and noble, which is why I deployed them in the first place. It's essential for our nation's peace and security. It's noble that these citizens volunteer to serve. Congress must support them. While debating strategies is acceptable, ensuring timely funding is crucial.

Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump.

And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, considering Mr. Howard's focus on climate change during this APEC gathering, hasn't your decision to hold a separate meeting in Washington weakened his attempts to establish ambitious goals? Also, to what extent do you see the ratification of Kyoto as relevant to addressing climate change? [SEP] Well, let's start with the latter part of your question. As I get older, you might need to repeat the first part. Kyoto may be suitable for some countries and may have made sense for those that ratified it, but it simply didn't make sense for the United States. Therefore, I spoke the truth. Before my arrival in Washington, the United States Senate had the opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of Kyoto. The vote was 95-to-nothing against it. So, it's not just my opinion; many people believed Kyoto wasn't the right approach. We developed a different strategy: energy efficiency standards based on new technologies. As I mentioned, we reduced greenhouse gases in America last year, and our economy grew at 3 percent. Not many countries can claim that, but we can because our strategy of implementing new technologies is working. I believe we can do a better job of becoming less dependent on foreign oil. As an energy exporter, that might concern some energy exporters. But we must reduce our dependency on oil and have put forth what's called a 20-in-10 program. Over the next 10 years, we will reduce our gasoline consumption by 20 percent by using ethanol and other new technologies. I believe battery technology is coming, so people in Sydney can drive the first 40 miles in their cars on battery without their car looking like a golf cart. There are new technologies coming to market. The fundamental question is how to get them to market as quickly as possible? Kyoto didn't do that as far as we were concerned. If you assess countries that are actually meeting the Kyoto targets, you might find that a different approach makes sense. The reason we rejected Kyoto is because it wouldn't have allowed us to do what we wanted to do, which is grow our economy, become less dependent on foreign oil, and be good stewards of the environment. John and I have discussed his desire to put climate change at the forefront of APEC, and I strongly supported that. I also reminded him that at the G-8, I conveyed the message that if we want to truly solve the global climate change issue, we need to get everyone to the table. We need to ensure that countries like China and India are at the table as we discuss the way forward. Otherwise, if they feel like nations are going to force a solution on them without giving them a voice on how to achieve a common objective, they'll walk away. And you can't have effective global climate change if a nation like China is not involved. I thought the Prime Minister did something smart in this protocol. He announced that we need to cut back on tariffs that prohibit the exportation of technologies that will enable China, for example, to burn coal in a cleaner way. He wants to tear down those tariffs and barriers, and we strongly support him, so that technology is more likely to flow from those of us who have it to those who don't. There are fundamental questions: How fast can we get effective technology to the market—coal sequestration technologies, nuclear spent fuel reprocessing technologies? And once to the market, can we help developing nations acquire those technologies? Otherwise, it's an exercise that's not going to be effective. I believe the strategy that we have laid forth is the most effective way to deal with this issue seriously. I also appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister is the one that brought the issue to focus and is talking about energy dependency, energy efficiency standards, which is a part of the global climate mix. He shows that leadership on the issue, and I'm proud to be here talking about the issue. Okay. Thank you.", "label": "Clarification"}

They are brilliant businesspeople, brilliant negotiators, and put us in a very tough spot. But I think we will have a deal with Japan.Likewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future. Many companies are leaving China right now because of the tariffs. China is subsidizing a lot of industry because—you know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no—it's not that way. They're paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars.Our farmers—out of all of that money, the tens of billions of dollars—we're giving a relatively small percentage to our farmers, who have really been a focal point of what's gone on with trade. As you know, they've earmarked, and they've gone after the farmer, thinking that if they hurt the farmer, I'm going to negotiate a bad deal for the rest of the country.I'll tell you, the American farmer, these are patriots. These are great patriots. They don't want subsidy. We've had meetings—and I've had meetings with 32, 35, 40 farmers at one time, numerous times. And they don't want subsidy. I've told that to you before, Jeff. They want a level playing field. That's all they want, because they're better than anybody in the world.And they've told me. I said, You know, I'm going to get you subsidy while China takes advantage of us and China takes advantage of you, by pinpointing you. They say: We don't want subsidies, sir. All we want is a laying play—really, a level playing field.The American farmer, these are great patriots. They are unbelievable people. And they're with me, a hundred percent. I believe that we will have a very good deal with China sometime into the future, because I don't believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don't believe they can do that.You know, businesses are leaving China by the hundreds, by the thousands, going into areas that are nontariffed, including the United States, by the way. But they're going to different parts of Asia: Vietnam; frankly, Japan. But they're going to a lot of places, but they're also coming to the United States, because people don't want to pay the tariff.And if you look, there is no tariff to pay.

So, the idea that leaking secrets goes unpunished? I don't think that's the message people will take away. Her sentence was way out of line compared to others. She had a trial, followed the rules, and owned up to what she did. Commuting, not pardoning, her sentence made sense. Justice was served, and the message is clear: national security is number one. If people have issues with what the government's doing, they should use the proper channels, the whistleblower protections. Sure, some think they're not enough, but we have to balance things. We need to keep people safe, both here and abroad. As for WikiLeaks, I don't see any conflict. I haven't said much about them.

It works for the security of the country, which is what the American people want. It enables our intelligence experts to understand Al Qaida's intentions. The law needs to be enhanced by providing liability protection to phone companies that helped us. So, we found common ground there. Hopefully, we can find common ground as Congress begins to move pieces of legislation. The reason I said what I said today is because there's a lot to be done. I'm not a legislator, but as head of the executive branch, I urge Congress to show progress and get results. It's hard to find common ground unless important bills are moving. They're not even moving. Not one appropriations bill has made it to my desk. How can you find common ground when there's no appropriations process? We found common ground on trade bills. Exports helped us overcome the weakness in the housing market last quarter. It makes sense to continue opening up markets to goods and services. Yet there haven't been any bills moving when it comes to trade. Veterans Affairs is an area where we can find common ground.

Now, the 215 program, which involves the collection of metadata, has been a focal point of public debate.

While there haven't been allegations of misuse, public concerns about potential abuse are valid. We're evaluating how to achieve the same security objectives while ensuring greater transparency and accountability. I have confidence in the NSA, but we must adapt to evolving technologies and address public anxieties. Furthermore, we must consider the international implications of our surveillance activities.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said this week that your microphone has never been louder on some of the key domestic priorities you've talked about, particularly Social Security and immigration. Your use of the Presidential microphone hasn't yielded the results that you wanted. So I'm wondering—the Democratic Congress, at this point, Republicans no longer controlling things on Capitol Hill—why you think your microphone is any louder, and how you plan to use it differently to get the results that you're looking for? [SEP] Yes, microphone being loud means—is that I'm able to help focus people's attentions on important issues. That's what I was referring to. In other words, the President is in a position to speak about priorities. Whether or not we can get those priorities done is going to take bipartisan cooperation, which I believe was one of the lessons of the campaigns.I will tell you, I felt like we had a pretty successful couple of years when it comes to legislation. After all, we reformed Medicare; we put tax policy in place that encouraged economic growth and vitality; we passed trade initiatives; passed a comprehensive energy bill. I'm signing an important piece of legislation today that continues a comprehensive approach to energy exploration, plus extenders on R&D, for example, tax credits. It's been a pretty substantial legislative record if you carefully scrutinize it.However, that doesn't mean necessarily that we are able to achieve the same kind of results without a different kind of approach. After all, you're right; the Democrats now control the House and the Senate. And therefore, I will continue to work with their leadership—and our own leaders, our own Members—to see if we can't find common ground on key issues like Social Security or immigration.I strongly believe that we can and must get a comprehensive immigration plan on my desk this year. It's important for us because, in order to enforce our border, in order for those Border Patrol agents who we've increased down there and given them more equipment and better border security, they've got to have help and a plan that says, If you're coming into America to do a job, you can come legally for a temporary basis to do so.I don't know if you've paid attention to the enforcement measures that were taken recently where in some of these packing plants they found people working that had been here illegally, but all of them had documents that said they were here legally. They were using forged documents, which just reminded me that the system we have in place has caused people to rely upon smugglers and forgers in order to do work Americans aren't doing.In other words, it is a system that is all aimed to bypass no matter what measures we take to protect this country. It is a system that, frankly, leads to inhumane treatment of people. And therefore, the best way to deal with an issue that Americans agree on—that is, that we ought to enforce our borders in a humane way— is we've got to have a comprehensive bill.And I have made a proposal. I have spoken about this to the Nation from the Oval Office. I continue to believe that the microphone is necessary to call people to action. And I want to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get a comprehensive bill to my desk. It's in our interest that we do this.In terms of energy, there's another area where I know we can work together. There is a consensus that we need to move forward with continued research on alternative forms of energy. I've just described them in my opening comments, and be glad to go over them again if you'd like, because they're positive. It's a positive development. We're making progress, and there's more to be done.So I'm looking forward to working with them. There's a lot of attitude here that says, Well, you lost the Congress; therefore, you're not going to get anything done. Quite the contrary; I have an interest to get things done. And the Democrat leaders have an interest to get something done to show that they're worthy of their leadership roles. And it is that common ground that I'm confident we can get— we can make positive progress, without either of us compromising principle.And I know they don't—I know they're not going to change their principles, and I'm not going to change mine. But nevertheless, that doesn't mean we can't find common ground to get good legislation done. That's what the American people want. The truth of the matter is, the American people are sick of the partisanship and name-calling.I will do my part to elevate the tone, and I'm looking forward to working with them. It's going to be an interesting new challenge. I'm used to it, as Herman [Ken Herman, Cox News] can testify. I was the Governor of Texas with Democrat leadership in the house and the senate, and we were able to get a lot of constructive things done for the State of Texas.

Do you think that Russia is applying undue pressure and threats to accomplish its goals at NATO on missile defense and stopping the Membership Action Plans of Ukraine and Georgia?And, Mr. President Yushchenko, what do you think of Moscow's tactics? [SEP] Just because there was a bunch of, you know, Soviet-era flags in the street yesterday doesn't—you shouldn't read anything into that. I—look, this is an interesting debate that's taking place. And it's—you know, as every nation has told me, Russia will not have a veto over what happens at Bucharest, and I take their word for it. And that's the right policy to have.I'm going to work as hard as I can to see to it that Ukraine and Georgia are accepted into MAP. I think it's in our interests as NATO members, and I think it's in Ukrainian and Georgian interests as well.And on missile defense, we'll see. I've made it abundantly clear to the—President Putin that the missile defense system is not aimed at defending against Russia. After all, Russia could easily overwhelm the missile defense systems that we have in—that we've envisioned. These systems are aimed at a nation out of the Middle East, for example, that could launch an attack against Europe and—just like our systems out in the Far East are aimed at helping protect ourselves from single-or dual-launch regimes.So obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to allay suspicions and old fears, but I believe we're making pretty good progress along those lines. When we're speaking about Ukrainian politics of joining the MAP and NATO membership, I would like to mention a couple basic things. First, this is not a policy against somebody. We are taking care of our national interest.Taking a look at our history, it's very rich in many tragedies for Ukrainian state that only the system of collective defense and security—international guarantees of the political sovereignty for Ukraine and territorial integrity will give the full response to the internal question in Ukraine. And I'm sure that for any Ukrainian who takes care of the future for Ukraine, a stable future for Ukraine, the issue of joining MAP is probably the most high-quality response to all the basic and fundamental interests of Ukraine.Secondly, I would like the debates that are now being carried out in Europe and in the world regarding Ukraine's prospects of joining the MAP and then after, NATO—form any new obstacle. I'm sure that we are going—we're taking the right track, and we are acting within the framework of our national sovereignty. Our nation is determined, and it corresponds to our political reasonability for the security of the state.I would like the basic and fundamental principle of work of the alliance—I mean, the open door policy would be replaced by the veto right by the country which is not even a member of the alliance. I'm sure that we're witnessing a very hot and overheated emotional discussion where there are few rules or even sometimes very little respect. But at the end of the day, the wisdom should win.And I want to firmly state that I'm only governed by a single issue. I want to bring calmness, stability, and security stability, in particular we—to this state. We want to be speaking about the Ukrainian presence in the world. We want to speak about the internal country. That's why only through these motives shall we want to have that dialogue, the talks.And what we have in our society—I mean, the part of the political forces who do not share this opinion—I think that this is all natural, because it's quite natural that today, like, hundreds—some hundreds of people and red flags were in the square. This is a remarkable because the Ukrainian famine was built under the same flags as the Ukrainian oppression. These were the flags that caused totalitarianism and sufferings that caused many deaths of millions of people. And I'm sure that the Ukrainian Communist Party may also appear one day in Ukraine that will be standing under the flags of the nation. But apparently we still need to have another Moses to bring people over the desert for 40 years, for those who lost national interest and forgot about it and continue living in the past.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said earlier that it was clear that Congress was rejecting the idea of a cap-and-trade program and that you wouldn't be able to move forward with that. Looking ahead, do you feel the same way about EPA regulating carbon emissions? Would you be open to them doing essentially the same thing through an administrative action, or is that off the table as well?And secondly, just to follow up on what you said about changing the way Washington works, do you think that--you said you didn't do enough to change the way things were handled in this city. Some of--in order to get your health care bill passed, you needed to make some of those deals. Do you wish, in retrospect, you had not made those deals and even if it meant the collapse of the program? [SEP] I think that making sure that families had security and that we're on a trajectory to lower health care costs was absolutely critical for this country. But you are absolutely right that when you are navigating through a House and a Senate in this kind of pretty partisan environment that it's a ugly mess when it comes to process. And I think that is something that really affected how people viewed the outcome. That is something that I regret, that we couldn't have made the process more--healthier than it ended up being. But I think the outcome was a good one.With respect to the EPA, I think the smartest thing for us to do is to see if we can get Democrats and Republicans in a room who are serious about energy independence and are serious about keeping our air clean and our water clean and dealing with the issue of greenhouse gases, and seeing are there ways that we can make progress in the short term and invest in technologies in the long term that start giving us the tools to reduce greenhouse gases and solve this problem.The EPA is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction. And I think one of the things that's very important for me is not to have us ignore the science, but rather to find ways that we can solve these problems that don't hurt the economy, that encourage the development of clean energy in this country, that in fact may give us opportunities to create entire new industries and create jobs, that--and that put us in a competitive posture around the world.So I think it's too early to say whether or not we can make some progress on that front. I think we can. Cap-and-trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way. It was a means, not an end. And I'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem.And I think EPA wants help from the legislature on this. I don't think that the desire is to somehow be protective of their powers here. I think what they want to do is make sure that the issue is being dealt with.Ed Henry [CNN].U.S. Military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell Policy/Administration Accomplishments/Bipartisanship/National Economy", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Are you considering sending more U.S. troops to Iraq? What would be the justification for it? And how reliable is this new timetable of 12 to 18 months? [SEP] I will send more troops to Iraq if General Casey says, I need more troops in Iraq to achieve victory. And that's the way I've been running this war. I have great faith in General Casey. I have great faith in Ambassador Khalilzad. I trust our commanders on the ground to give the best advice about how to achieve victory. I want to remind you, victory is a government that can sustain itself, govern itself— a country that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself and serves as an ally in the war on terror—which stands in stark contrast to a government that would be chaotic, that would be a safe haven for the enemy to launch attacks on us.One way for the American people to understand what Iraq could look like is what Afghanistan looked like under the Taliban, a place where there was no freedom; a place where women were taken to the public square and beaten if they did not adhere to the strict, intolerant guidelines of the Taliban; a place where thousands trained to attack America and our allies. Afghanistan doesn't have nearly the resources that Iraq has. Imagine a safe haven for an enemy that ended up with the resources that it had.It is—and so this is a war where I say to our generals, Do you have what it takes to win? Now, General Casey talked about part of our strategy, and part of the strategy is to give the Iraq Government the tools necessary to protect itself, to defend itself. If you're able to defend yourself, you're more likely to be able to govern yourself as well. But politics—the political way forward and the military way forward must go hand in hand.And what the General was saying yesterday is that there is a three-step process to enable the Iraqi forces to be able to help this Government bring security. One was to train and equip. The goal is 325,000 troops, 137,000 military and the balance, police.Second was to put the Iraqi security forces in the lead. Six of ten divisions now are in the lead in helping this Government defend itself. The strategy has been to embed U.S. personnel, officers and non-com officers, into these forces to help them gain the confidence and the capacity to be effective when they're in the lead.And the third step is for the Iraqi security forces to be able to operate independently. And this, perhaps, is going to be one of the most difficult aspects of having the Iraqis ready to go, because that means they have to be able to drive themselves, maintain their vehicles, provide logistics, have combat service support. And that's what General Casey was describing.The key is that our commanders feel that there—they have got enough flexibility to design the program to meet the conditions on the ground. You know, last spring, I thought for a period of time we'd be able to reduce our troop presence early next year. That's what I felt. But because we didn't have a fixed timetable and because General Casey and General Abizaid and the other generals there understand that the way we're running this war is to give them flexibility, have the confidence necessary to come and make the right recommendations here in Washington, DC, they decided that that wasn't going to happen. And so what he was describing to you was the way forward to make sure that the Iraqis are fully prepared to defend themselves.", "label": "Explicit"}

You had a majority consensus to do all this. It's now been shelved. It seems that you have not taken--I guess my question is what was the point of the fiscal commission? If you have this moment where you had Tom Coburn, your conservative friend in the United States Senate, sign on to this deal; Judd Gregg was also on this thing; you had Dick Durbin, your good friend from Illinois, Democrat--everything you just described in the answer to Chip and the answer to Ben just happened. Why not grab it? [SEP] The notion that it has been shelved, I think, is incorrect. It still provides a framework for a conversation.Part of the challenge here is that this town, let's face it, you guys are pretty impatient. If something doesn't happen today, then the assumption is it's just not going to happen, right? I've had this conversation for that last 2 years about every single issue that we worked on, whether it was health care or don't ask, don't tell, on Egypt, right? We've had this monumental change over the last 3 weeks, well, why did it take 3 weeks? [] So I think that there's a tendency for us to assume that if it didn't happen today, it's not going to happen.Well, the fiscal commission put out a framework. I agree with much of the framework; I disagree with some of the framework. It is true that it got 11 votes, and that was a positive sign. What's also true is, for example, is, is that the chairman of the House Republican budgeteers didn't sign on. He's got a little bit of juice when it comes to trying to get an eventual budget done. So he's got concerns. So I'm going to have to have a conversation with him, what would he like to see happen.I'm going to have to have a conversation with those Democrats who didn't vote for it. There are some issues in there that, as a matter of principle, I don't agree with, where I think they didn't go far enough, or they went too far. So this is going to be a process in which each side, both in--in both Chambers of Congress, go back and forth and start trying to whittle their differences down until we arrive at something that has an actual chance of passage.And that's my goal. I mean, my goal here is to actually solve the problem. It's not to get a good headline on the first day.

Once it concludes, appropriate steps will be taken. As for E-Verify, we need comprehensive reform. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: a system upholding both our laws and our immigrant heritage is essential. This necessitates strong border security, targeting employers who illegally hire and exploit workers, and providing a pathway to legal status for those living in the shadows. While a perfect package may be elusive, balance is key. E-Verify can be a valuable tool if accurate and protective of U.S. citizens.

Okay?And with respect to the issue of mandate, I've got one mandate. I've got a mandate to help middle class families and families that are working hard to try to get into the middle class. That's my mandate. That's what the American people said. They said: Work really hard to help us. Don't worry about the politics of it, don't worry about the party interests, don't worry about the special interests. Just work really hard to see if you can help us get ahead, because we're working really hard out here and we're still struggling, a lot of us. That's my mandate.I don't presume that because I won an election that everybody suddenly agrees with me on everything. I'm more than familiar with all the literature about Presidential overreach in second terms. We are very cautious about that. On the other hand, I didn't get reelected just to bask in reelection. I got elected to do work on behalf of American families and small businesses all across the country who are still recovering from a really bad recession, but are hopeful about the future.And I am too. The one thing that I said during the campaign that maybe sounds like a bunch of campaign rhetoric, but now that the campaign is over, I am going to repeat it, and hopefully, you guys will really believe me: When you travel around the country, you are inspired by the grit and resilience and hard work and decency of the American people.

They deserve all of us here in Washington to be thinking every single day, how can I make things a little better for them.

For example, on proliferation matters, it's in our interest to be able to make sure that materials that could cause great harm aren't proliferated. It's in our interest to work together on Iran. As I said, I think, in this room the last time I was here, I appreciated the fact that Vladimir Putin told the Iranians that they will provide--they, Russia--will provide enriched uranium to run the Bushehr power plant, thereby negating the need for the Iranians to enrich in the first place. I thought that was a constructive suggestion. And we need to be in a position to be able to work with Russia on Iran.

{"sentence": "Q. ISIL claimed responsibility for the massacre, sending the message that they could now target civilians all over the world. The equation has clearly changed. Isn't it time for your strategy to change? [SEP] Well, keep in mind what we have been doing. We have a military strategy that involves putting enormous pressure on ISIL through airstrikes, that has put assistance and training on the ground with Iraqi forces. We're now working with Syrian forces as well to squeeze ISIL, cut off their supply lines. We've been coordinating internationally to reduce their financing capabilities, the oil that they're trying to ship outside. We are taking strikes against high-value targets, including, most recently, against the individual who was on the video executing civilians who had already been captured, as well as the head of ISIL in Libya. So it's not just in Iraq and Syria.And so on the military front, we are continuing to accelerate what we do. As we find additional partners on the ground that are effective, we work with them more closely. I've already authorized additional Special Forces on the ground who are going to be able to improve that coordination.On the counterterrorism front, keep in mind that since I came into office, we have been worried about these kinds of attacks. The vigilance that the United States Government maintains and the cooperation that we're consistently expanding with our European and other partners in going after every single terrorist network is robust and constant. And every few weeks, I meet with my entire national security team, and we go over every single threat stream that is presented, and where we have relevant information, we share it immediately with our counterparts around the world, including our European partners.On aviation security, we have, over the last several years, been working so that at various airports sites—not just in the United States, but overseas—we are strengthening our mechanisms to screen and discover passengers who should not be boarding flights and improving the manners in which we are screening luggage that is going onboard.And on the diplomatic front, we've been consistently working to try to get all the parties together to recognize that there is a moderate opposition inside of Syria that can form the basis for a transition government and to reach out not only to our friends, but also to the Russians and the Iranians who are on the other side of this equation to explain to them that ultimately an organization like ISIL is the greatest danger to them, as well as to us.So there will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward, but the strategy that we are putting forward is the strategy that ultimately is going to work. But as I said from the start, it's going to take time.And what's been interesting is, in the aftermath of Paris, as I listen to those who suggest something else needs to be done, typically, the things they suggest need to be done are things we are already doing. The one exception is that there have been a few who have suggested that we should put large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground.And keep in mind that we have the finest military in the world and we have the finest military minds in the world, and I've been meeting with them intensively for years now, discussing these various options, and it is not just my view, but the view of my closest military and civilian advisers that that would be a mistake, not because our military could not march into Mosul or Raqqa or Ramadi and temporarily clear out ISIL, but because we would see a repetition of what we've seen before, which is, if you do not have local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes, that they resurface, unless we're prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries.And let's assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there's a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if there's a terrorist network that's operating anywhere else in North Africa or in Southeast Asia?So a strategy has to be one that can be sustained. And the strategy that we're pursuing, which focuses on going after targets, limiting wherever possible the capabilities of ISIL on the ground, systematically going after their leadership, their infrastructure, strengthening Shia—or strengthening Syrian and Iraqi forces that are—and Kurdish forces that are prepared to fight them, cutting off their borders and squeezing the space in which they can operate until ultimately we're able to defeat them—that's the strategy we're going to have to pursue.And we will continue to generate more partners for that strategy. And there are going to be some things that we try that don't work; there will be some strategies we try that do work. And when we find strategies that work, we will double down on those.

{"sentence": "Q. And, as a general point, what rate, then, would you want in there: a percentage or a flat rate? [SEP] We are looking at it. We're also looking at various other things that I'm allowed to do under the system, and—such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we're allowed to do things.We're talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat-run States and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean, really bad management. So that seems to be where they're looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats, in some cases, radical-left Democrats that have not done a good job.I appreciate—today the Wall Street Journal said very good things—that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in. Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, and the folks—we went into Portland, and we've done a great job. And they had that in an editorial, that we really won that situation. But we want the whole—we did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in. We took care of it. And we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said.As far as the various things that I may or may not sign: I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made, as you know very well, on the Hill. We'll see what happens. But I have the right—including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things.We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It's not their fault. It's China's fault; it's not their fault. And people are being evicted, and we can do that with an Executive order. So if we don't get—and we want to do it relatively quickly.I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted, and then they go into shelters, and there are thousands of people in the shelters. And this is not a time—you never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it, and it's no good.So I may have to do something on evictions too, because the Democrats, amazingly, don't want to do it. We offered them short-term deals, and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out States that have been poorly managed by Democrats.Okay.

{"sentence": "President, considering Mr. Howard's emphasis on climate change during this APEC summit, hasn't your scheduling conflict in Washington detracted from his objectives? Furthermore, what significance do you attribute to the Kyoto Protocol in tackling climate change? [SEP] Allow me to begin with the latter point. As I advance in years, I may require occasional reminders. The Kyoto agreement may prove efficacious for certain nations, yet it failed to align with the interests of the United States. I conveyed this candidly. Prior to my departure for Washington, the United States Senate conducted a vote, resulting in a resounding 95-to-nothing rejection of the Kyoto Protocol. Consequently, this viewpoint transcends my personal opinion. We have adopted an alternative methodology centered on energy efficiency benchmarks predicated on novel technologies. Last year, we achieved a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within the United States while simultaneously experiencing a 3 percent economic expansion. I am uncertain as to whether numerous nations can assert the same. Our approach, which prioritizes the implementation of innovative technologies, is demonstrably yielding positive outcomes. I firmly believe in our capacity to diminish our reliance on foreign sources of petroleum. As an energy-exporting nation, this prospect may engender apprehension among certain entities. To that end, we have promulgated the '20-in-10' initiative, which seeks to curtail gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next decade through the utilization of ethanol and other cutting-edge technologies. I anticipate advancements in battery technology that will enable individuals in locales such as Sydney to traverse the initial 40 miles in their automobiles utilizing battery power, without compromising the aesthetic appeal of their vehicles. The fundamental inquiry revolves around expediting the market introduction of these technologies. The Kyoto Protocol, in our estimation, fell short in this regard. A comprehensive assessment of nations adhering to the Kyoto targets may reveal the merits of an alternative strategy. Our rejection of the Kyoto Protocol stemmed from its incompatibility with our objectives: economic expansion, reduced dependence on foreign oil, and responsible environmental stewardship. I have engaged in discussions with John regarding his aspiration to prioritize climate change at APEC, and I have expressed my unwavering support. I also reiterated the message conveyed at the G-8, emphasizing the imperative of inclusivity in addressing global climate change. The involvement of nations such as China and India is paramount. Otherwise, the imposition of solutions without their input may lead to their disengagement, thereby undermining the efficacy of global climate change initiatives. The Prime Minister's protocol demonstrated sagacity by advocating for the reduction of tariffs that impede the exportation of technologies facilitating cleaner coal combustion in nations such as China. His objective is to dismantle these barriers, and we wholeheartedly endorse his efforts. The critical questions pertain to the expeditious deployment of effective technologies, such as coal sequestration and nuclear spent fuel reprocessing, and the facilitation of their acquisition by developing nations. Absent these measures, the endeavor risks futility. Our proposed strategy represents the most efficacious means of addressing this issue in a substantive manner. I commend the Prime Minister for his leadership in prioritizing this issue and for advocating for energy dependency and efficiency standards, which constitute integral components of the global climate mix. I am honored to participate in this discussion. Thank you.", "label": "Clarification"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. President. [Laughter] Mr. President, you say the Democrats are undercutting troops, the way they have voted. They're obviously trying to assert more control over foreign policy. Isn't that what the voters elected them to do, in November? [SEP] I think the voters in America want Congress to support our troops in—who are in harm's way. They want money to the troops, and they don't want politicians in Washington telling our generals how to fight a war. It's one thing to object to the policy, but it's another thing when you have troops in harm's way not to give them the funds they need.And no question there's been a political dance going on here in Washington. You've followed this closely; you know what I'm talking about. Not only was there a political dance going on—in other words, people were trying to appeal to one side of their party or another—but they then had to bring out new funding streams in order to attract votes to a emergency war supplemental.And my concern, David, is several: One, Congress shouldn't tell generals how to run the war; Congress should not shortchange our military; Congress should not use a emergency war spending measure as a vehicle to put pet spending projects on that have nothing to do with the war.Secondly, as I mentioned in these remarks, delays beyond mid-April and then into May will affect the readiness of the U.S. military. So my attitude is, enough politics. They need to come back, pass a bill. If they want to play politics, fine. They continue to do that; I will veto it. But they ought to do it quickly. They ought to get the bill to my desk as quickly as possible, and I'll veto it. And then we can get down to the business of funding our troops without strings and without withdrawal dates.It is amazing to me that, one, the United States Senate passed a—confirmed General Petraeus overwhelmingly, after he testified as to what he thinks is necessary to succeed in Iraq, and then won't fund him. Secondly, we have put 40 percent of the reinforcements in place, and yet people already want to start withdrawing before the mission has had a chance to succeed.They need to come off their vacation, get a bill to my desk, and if it's got strings and mandates and withdrawals and pork, I'll veto it. And then we can get down to the business of getting this thing done, and we can do it quickly. It doesn't have to take a lot of time.

{"sentence": "Q. When Congress has linked war funding with a timetable, you have argued micromanagement. When they've linked it to unrelated spending, you've argued porkbarrel. But now there's talk from Harry Reid and others that if you veto this bill, they may come back and just simply cut off funding. Wouldn't that be a legitimate exercise of a congressional authority, which is the power of the purse? [SEP] The Congress is exercising its legitimate authority as it sees fit right now. I just disagree with their decisions. I think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake. It is a— it sends mixed signals, bad signals to the region and to the Iraqi citizens.Listen, the Iraqis are wondering whether or not we're going to stay to help. People in America wonder whether or not they've got the political will to do the hard work— that's what Plante was asking about. My conversations with President [Prime Minister] * Maliki, he seems dedicated to doing that, and we will continue to work with him to achieve those objectives. But they're wondering whether or not America is going to keep commitments. And so when they hear withdrawal and timetables, it, rightly so, sends different kinds of signals.It's interesting that Harry Reid, Leader Reid, spoke out with a different option. Whatever option they choose, I would hope they get home, get a bill, and get it to my desk. And if it has artificial timetables of withdrawal or if it cuts off funding for troops or if it tells our generals how to run a war, I'll veto it. And then we can get about the business of giving our troops what they need—what our generals want them to have, and give our generals the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives that we set out by reinforcing troops in Iraq.You know, what's interesting is, you don't hear a lot of debate about Washington as to what will happen if there is failure. Again, Plante mentioned that people don't think we can succeed; in other words, there's no chance of succeeding. That's a part of the debate. But what people also have got to understand is what will happen if we fail. And the way you fail is to leave before the job is done; in other words, just abandon this young democracy, say, We're tired; we'll withdraw from Baghdad, and hope there's not chaos.I believe that if this capital city were to fall into chaos, which is where it was headed prior to reinforcing, that there would be no chance for this young democracy to survive. That's why I made the decision I made. And the reason why I believe it's important to help this young democracy survive is so that the country has a chance to become a stabilizing influence in a dangerous part of the world.I also understand that if the country— if the experience were to fail, radicals would be emboldened. People that had been—that can't stand America would find new ways to recruit. There would be potentially additional resources for them to use at their disposal.The failure in Iraq would endanger American security. I have told the American people often: It is best to defeat them there so we don't have to face them here, fully recognizing that what happens over there can affect the security here. That's one of the major lessons of September the 11th. In that case, there was safe haven found in a failed state, where killers plotted and planned and trained and came and killed 3,000 of our citizens. And I vowed we weren't going to let that happen again.Secondly, the way to defeat the ideology that these people believe is through a competing ideology, one based upon liberty and human rights and human dignity. And there are some who, I guess, say that's impossible to happen in the Middle East. I strongly disagree. I know it is hard work.

As for the Justice Department, I won't comment on a specific pending case, but I can discuss the balance we must strike.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, as your time in office dwindles, what are your remaining priorities, and how concerned are you about the immigration bill's fate amidst the upcoming electoral battles? [SEP] Listen, we've got to push through that energy legislation. Renewing No Child Left Behind is a must. We need those trade deals with Panama, Peru, and Colombia to clear Congress, and I'm hoping we can build on the progress we've made with the Korean free trade agreement. My aim is to bring back successful Doha negotiations for a congressional vote, which requires a TPA extension. And we absolutely must maintain our momentum on balancing the budget. The deficit's shrinking faster than expected, thanks to increased tax revenues and the measures we've implemented. Now, we need Congress to avoid overspending and those tax hikes that would cripple the economy and, in turn, hurt Treasury revenues. I'm very concerned about the Democrats' tax-and-spend agenda. I'm waiting to see how they plan to balance the budget in five years. And, of course, the war on terror remains a top priority. I'm hoping to find common ground with both parties on Iraq. Some just want to pull out, but I strongly disagree, and I believe most Americans do as well. The recent vote showed what we can achieve when we work together. On immigration, it's a complex issue. I've always been a proponent of comprehensive reform to secure our border. It's a promise I made on the campaign trail, and it's something I believed in as Governor of Texas. I understand the frustrations surrounding illegal immigration, which is why we've significantly ramped up border security. We're doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and adding more fencing and equipment. I even deployed the National Guard for a while. This bill addresses those concerns by setting clear security benchmarks that must be met before any other reforms can take effect. Last year, the call was for security first, and that's precisely what this bill delivers. However, I don't see how we can achieve the level of border security the American people expect without a temporary-worker program that includes verifiable work cards. People will come here to work, and they'll find a way to do it. This has fueled an underground industry of smugglers and document forgers, which is simply inhumane. It's not who we are as Americans. The best way to combat this is to offer a legal, temporary pathway for people to fill jobs that Americans aren't doing. I'd much rather have people crossing the border with legitimate cards than being crammed into the back of a truck. Secondly, we need a reliable system for employer verification. It's against the law to hire someone who's here illegally, but businesses often struggle to verify the authenticity of documents. That's why we need a tamper-proof ID card, which is a key component of this bill. The toughest question is what to do with those who are already here. Some would call anything short of deportation amnesty, but deporting 12 million people is simply not realistic. Nor should they be granted automatic citizenship. So, we've developed a plan that requires them to meet certain conditions to obtain a Z visa, including background checks, fines, and a probationary period, before they can even apply for citizenship. If you're looking for reasons to oppose the bill, you'll find them, but it's a comprehensive and well-thought-out solution. I knew this would be a contentious issue. It's easy to demonize someone who's working hard here. I want to get this bill done because it's the right thing to do and because it will address the problem effectively. I want to take it out of the political arena. Immigration debates can bring out the worst in people. We're a nation of immigrants. I was deeply moved by the Coast Guard Academy ensign who spoke about his grandfather, a migrant from Mexico. He was proud to serve America. Welcoming those who seek to work and achieve the American Dream revitalizes our nation. We have an opportunity to enact a good law now, but it will require hard work. Politics will inevitably play a role, but I hope that Members of Congress will rise above it. I know I will. It's the right thing to do. I'll continue to engage with them and urge them to show the courage needed to get this bill to my desk as soon as possible. Thank you.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. Good morning to both Presidents. President Bush, I ask you, why do Mexicans want to—why would you think that Mexicans could believe in a reform in migration when for so many years, this was not a possibility nor reality? And what are your chances of coming through with this bill in Congress? And President Calderon, you had lunch with President Fox. Can you tell us what you talked about? [SEP] They talked about . [] Excuse me. I wasn't there. []No, that's a legitimate question, and the question is, why now? Why do I think something positive can happen? Well, first of all, the legislative process takes awhile in the United States. I don't know about Mexico, Mr. President, but sometimes legislators, you know, debate issues for awhile before a solution can be achieved.And we had a very—by the way, we haven't had a serious debate on migration until recently. A law was passed in 1986, and then there really wasn't a serious debate until pretty much starting after the year 2000, if my memory serves me well. I've always known this is an important issue because I happened to have been the Governor of Texas. And so I'm very comfortable about discussing the issue and have elevated the issue over the past years. And Members of Congress have taken the issue very seriously, but it's hard to get legislation out of the Congress on a very complex issue.A lot of Americans were deeply concerned that the United States was not enforcing our laws. They felt like there wasn't a commitment to the rule of law. Over the past year, I believe we have shown the American people that there is a strong commitment to the rule of law. And I think Members of Congress are now feeling more comfortable that the country is committed to rule of law, which then makes some more openminded to my argument, which is that if we can have migration reform, it will make it less likely somebody will feel like they have to sneak across our border, and, therefore, take pressure off the border. In other words, security for the country, border security, will be enhanced by a good migration law, and then it will make it easier for us to focus our assets on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns moving both ways.I believe—I feel pretty good about it. I don't want to predict legislative successes. But I can tell you my mood, and my mood is optimistic because the mood in the Congress seems like it has changed from skepticism last year to knowledge that getting a comprehensive bill will be in the Nation's interests.Secondly, I'm optimistic because Republicans in the Senate are working with Democrats in the Senate. We're facilitating that work. The administration is very much involved with helping the Senators find common ground, to the point where we can move a bill as quickly as possible out of the Senate so it gets to the House of Representatives.I'm not a betting man. I don't like to bet, because when I do, I usually lose. But I'm an optimistic man, in this case, about getting comprehensive reform, and a bill is in the interests of both countries. I met with former President Vicente Fox, whom I like, and we have a good friendship. We belong to the same party. I invited him to lunch; we talked for quite a while, talked about matters in a very constructive fashion. And he congratulated us for the work that we've done during these first 100 days. He also said that he had the will to collaborate and cooperate in a respectful fashion with the government for the benefit of Mexicans.I have also met with other former Presidents, and I'm sure that I will continue to meet with President Fox in the future throughout my administration.

You said many times, Mr. President, that the way the Europeans handled the economy—the economic crisis—had the opposite effect. And also, you talked many times against the austerity. And of course, you are right. Why, in your opinion, you didn't succeed to convince the Europeans to follow your way? And what are you going to do the last 2 months to help Greece and the Greek people? Also, I have a short question about Cyprus. Both of you, you talk about Cyprus. And it's a dear issue for me because I born in Cyprus. How can you convince the President of Turkey to end the occupation of Cyprus, Mr. President? [SEP] Well, let me take the second question first This is ultimately a negotiation between Cypriots: Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots And the good news is that you have two leaders who seem genuinely committed to finding compromises and an approach that would serve both their peoples well If in fact you can see a meeting of the minds between them, then the issue will be can we make sure that all of us, the international community—Turkey, Greece, the United States—support that agreement in a way that can be ratified by both sides And we have invested a lot of time Vice President Biden has been actively involved in this We are encouraged by the progress that's been made I think there's a window in the next few weeks, months, where this issue was actually resolved And I think if we can find an equitable solution, it won't provide a hundred percent of what either side wants, there may be some mechanisms for a transition from the status quo to the future that both sides envision, but I think it's achievable And we're going to do everything we can to support the processWith respect to the economy and Europe, again, I think it's important to recognize that in some ways my job was simpler because, at least in the first 2 years, I had majorities of my party controlling Congress And I'm just one country [] So Congress is hard to deal with [] Dealing with multiple Parliaments and commissions and unions and this and that and the other and—that's very complicated And so the need, I think, to operate by consensus, the fact that not all European countries were similarly situated, even though their economy shared a currency, that made their task more difficult And so I want to make sure that I'm clear that I don't envy the hard job that each European leader had in circumstances that oftentimes they had inheritedWhat I've tried to do is just offer our best thinking, whether it's in resolving problems in banks quickly—because the quicker you resolve the problems with banks and there's transparency in that process, the faster they recapitalize and are able to make investments When the economy is shrinking, providing jobs, spending on things like infrastructure can actually increase revenue and drive down debt And then, there's going to be a time at which point that has to be taken care ofI mean, for example, in the United States, our deficits went up in those first 2 years because we were engaging in a lot of emergency spending Our deficits have now been reduced by two-thirds, primarily because we started growing again, and we started taking in more tax revenueSo there's some lessons, I think, that are applicable for all countries And what we've just tried to do is offer the best advice that we can, understanding that when you're dealing with multiple nations, but a single currency, and then a European Union, where some people are in the currency and some people are not in the currency, and a European Parliament and European Council and—that's a lot of meetings [] Okay?Prime Minister Tsipras I will fully agree with what has just said in answering the question about Cyprus It is not a bilateral issue It is not a problem between Greece and Turkey It's an international problem, which has been going on for 42 years—as long as I'm alive—and it is a problem of illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus We make our best, we do our best in—to encourage both sides to help them reach a fair and equitable and sustainable solutionIn my first visit to Cyprus as a Prime Minister, I tried and I did meet over and above the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, a number of representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community And I think that that was the first time that a Greek Prime Minister was meeting with them We are interested in making sure that the people of Cyprus will be able to live in a reunited Cyprus where they are free, where there's a democracy, freedom, and Cyprus is a member of the European UnionSo I would like to make it clear that as regards Greece, we are in favor of a solution We stand by the side of President Anastasiadis, who is making the effort, and we are only ready to discuss with Turkey the part which is relevant to us; that is the guarantees Because since 1959, since 1960, this obsolete issue of guarantees also concerns Greece But Greece is not the country which has occupied and illegally—invaded and illegally occupied CyprusSo I believe that a fair and sustainable solution means a solution without the permanent presence of Turkish troops on the island And at the same time, I think that the best guarantee for the Cypriot people to feel safe is the potential of a fair and sustainable solution And if this happens, things will change not only for Cyprus, but for the wider region, in general and for Greek-Turkish relations This is how we are proceedingI believe that, yes, President Erdogan plays an important role, but it is not my responsibility to convince him, Mr Ignoti The final question will come from Chris Jansing with NBC News", "label": "Implicit"}

What we *are* talking about is ensuring that Iran, having met its obligations under the agreement, can participate in the global economy. They've dismantled centrifuges, shipped out enriched uranium, and opened their facilities to inspectors. Now, some say that any economic relief is a betrayal, but I say that keeping our word is paramount. We're exploring ways for them to engage in legitimate business, perhaps through European channels, without necessarily requiring dollar-denominated transactions.

However, I would emphasize that elections matter, voting matters, and informed engagement matters. Don't take our system of government for granted. Democracy requires constant effort.

My administration is actively reviewing all possible avenues to enhance enforcement of current gun laws and prevent access to weapons by those who would misuse them.

Congress consistently rejects even modest gun safety measures due to political considerations. Special interest groups fund campaigns and exploit fear.

Citizens must prioritize gun safety when making their electoral choices, even if it requires temporarily setting aside other concerns.

Critics argue this allows Iran to exploit loopholes.

[SEP] Let's be clear: we have a framework, a solid foundation built on agreements between Iran and the P5+1. Certain aspects, like centrifuge reduction at Natanz and Fordow's conversion, are meticulously defined. Others involve broader intentions, where the devil is truly in the details.

And it's really important for people to have confidence in the mortgage markets and that there be stability in the mortgage markets. And that's why Secretary Paulson announced the plan this weekend, which says that he needs authorities from the Congress to come up with a line of credit for these institutions, if needed, and that he ought to have the authority to invest capital, if needed.And so the purpose was to send a clear signal that, one, we understand how important these institutions are to the mortgage markets, and two, to kind of calm nerves. The truth of the matter is, by laying this out, it is—makes it less likely we'll need to use this kind of authority to begin with, which, by the way, is temporary authority.As you—talked about banks. Now, if you're a commercial bank in America and your deposit—and you have a deposit in a commercial bank in America, your deposit is insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. And so therefore, when you hear nervousness about your bank, you know, people start talking about how nervous they are about your bank's condition, the depositor must understand that the Federal Government, through the FDIC, stands behind the deposit up to $100,000. And therefore—which leads me to say that if you're a depositor, you're in—you're protected by the Federal Government.I happened to have witnessed a bank run in Midland, Texas, one time. I'll never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying, Your deposits are good. We got you insured. You don't have to worry about it if you got less than $100,000 in the bank. The problem was, people didn't hear. And there's a—became a nervousness. My hope is, is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our Government.So these are two different instances, mortgage markets on the one hand, banking on the other.", "label": "General"}

In Israel, the press writes that Israel might well contemplate action against this threat that Iran poses to them. What would be your—what are you saying, Mr. President, to the Israeli Government? And you said, Chancellor, give diplomacy a chance. Madam Chancellor, Mr. President, how long would you say diplomacy has to be given a chance? Can we exclude that during your term in office military action will be taken—will take place against Iran, Mr. President?And you, Chancellor, how do you assess the era of George Bush? In your party, one of your leading party members said that you will not miss George Bush. Will you miss him?And a question directed to both of you. Why do you, Mr. President——Chancellor Merkel. I think—don't ask for too long. Q. ——but why do you—why are you seen as so unpopular, Mr. President, in Germany? [SEP] I just told you that all options are on the table, and my first choice is to solve this diplomatically. And the best way to solve it diplomatically is to work with our partners, and that's exactly what we're doing. And the message to the ian Government is very clear: that there's a better way forward than isolation, and that is for you to verifiably suspend your enrichment program. And the choice is theirs to make. Obviously, we want to solve this issue peacefully, and so we'll give diplomacy a chance to work. And I want to thank the message that came out of the EU meeting yesterday, which is that if they choose to be—continue to be obstinate, there will be additional sanctions. We talked just now at some length about this. I very clearly pin my hopes on diplomatic efforts. And I believe that diplomatic pressure actually already has taken effect. If you look at the situation in on the ground, you see that quite clearly. These efforts can have a success, but this presupposes, obviously, that the global community is sort of unified. Both in the European Union and in the world Security Council, we have to continue this common approach. We cannot exclude either that there may well be a further round of sanctions, and those need to be negotiated in the Security Council of the United Nations.What's important now is to see to it that this last round of the sanctions is actually implemented and can take effect, because the effectiveness of sanctions is actually then proved only once they are taken seriously. And we are under certain—quite a considerable pressure to act together and in concert. And we in the European Union will do everything to see to it that this actually happens.As regards our relationship, you know that this is a relationship characterized by friendship. It's a direct and candid relationship. When there are differences of opinion—whenever there were differences of opinions, we actually called a spade a spade. It's actually nice about the President that you can actually call a spade a spade with him. And when, for example, I had— as regards to the climate change discussion last year, this year, when we—ever we had differences of opinion, there was a way forward; there was a constructive way forward.And I think that this initiative on climate by the European Union is a very important initiative. The President himself took, actually, forward action on this, apart from our military action that we do together, for example, in Afghanistan, in the general international negotiating processes.We also need on other areas between the European Union and the United States, not only Germany and the United States, a lot of close cooperation in many areas. And there was always greater—great openness here between us. This cooperation is fun, I must say. And as the President said, it is going to be a sprint to the last day of his office. And I trust—often trust that we shall have other similar meetings of this kind, candid and open and constructive.I'm looking forward to the G-8 summit in Japan. I hope that we can make further progress on climate protection, which— talking about targets now—that is to say, some kind of binding targets—I think is already great success.", "label": "Dodging"}

I get along with almost all countries.I get along with North Korea. Remember? We were supposed to be going to war with North Korea. If Hillary got elected, you'd be at war right now with North Korea. That would be a very messy war, a very bad war. Many millions of people would be killed. In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I'd be at war in 1 week; it's been just the opposite.We're doing very well in Afghanistan, bringing the troops down—very low level—and other things are happening.

And the sanctions and everything else.At the same time, with Russia, we're right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It's a very important thing. To me, it's the most important thing. Some people say global warming; I don't. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest; they are the second biggest, nuclear-wise. China is third. They're actually a distant third, but they're building pretty rapidly.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, critics claim you've shifted your stance on tax increases, particularly regarding Social Security and those who supported you. Furthermore, there's a growing perception that negotiations are stalling. Can you provide an honest assessment? Are we headed for a fiscal crisis? [SEP] Look, let's be clear: a crisis is avoidable. During the campaign, I said we needed a balanced approach to deficit reduction. That means millionaires and billionaires paying their fair share, tough spending cuts, but protecting vulnerable families. The package I proposed reflects that balance. I'm willing to make tough concessions, even ones unpopular with my own party, to reach a compromise. We need a solution that both parties can support to stabilize the economy and protect the middle class. I've already moved significantly towards Republican concerns, even though the majority of Americans agree we should raise taxes on the wealthiest to reduce the deficit. The fact that Speaker Boehner hasn't accepted what I believe is a fair deal is perplexing. I remain optimistic, but ultimately, Congress needs to do its job. The framework for a deal is there, but it requires compromise. Voters want compromise, not ideological gridlock. We need to act in the best interests of the country, especially after recent tragedies. I'm ready to get a deal done before Christmas, but it requires adjustments from both sides. The Speaker's 'Plan B', which gives tax breaks to millionaires while cutting unemployment benefits, violates the principles debated during the election.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, could you address the widespread anger among Democrats regarding the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy in the recent tax bill? Do you believe your rhetoric, labeling these tax cuts as 'morally inappropriate,' exacerbates this division? [SEP] I appreciate the frustration. I've stated previously, and I'll reiterate: I don't believe we can sustain tax breaks for individuals who are already prosperous. They thrived during Bill Clinton's presidency. This will be a recurring debate over the coming years. Upon the swearing-in of the new Congress, we'll need to discuss how to achieve a balanced budget. This necessitates cutting ineffective programs, but also honestly addressing the funding of essential priorities. If we aim to provide adequate care for our veterans, we must allocate funds for the necessary doctors and facilities. If we aspire for our children's success, we must invest in education. If we seek to maintain our competitiveness, we must invest in basic research. We must weigh the option of maintaining tax cuts for the wealthy against investing in these priorities. I comprehend why some Democrats, and even some Republicans, believe we could have foregone that aspect of the tax package. However, compromise entails accepting certain unfavorable elements. The overall package was the correct one to stimulate economic growth and job creation. There's no superior antipoverty program than a thriving economy, nor a better deficit-reduction program.

Was there a failure either on the part of the Democratic leadership on the Hill or here that you couldn't preclude these wealthier cuts from going forward? [SEP] Well, let me say that on the Republican side, this is their holy grail, these tax cuts for the wealthy. This is--seems to be their central economic doctrine. And so, unless we had 60 votes in the Senate at any given time, it would be very hard for us to move this forward. I have said that I would have liked to have seen a vote before the election. I thought this was a strong position for us to take into the election, to crystallize the positions of the two parties, because I think the Democrats have better ideas. I think our proposal to make sure that the middle class is held harmless, but that we don't make these Bush tax cuts permanent for wealthy individuals, because it was going to cost the country at a time when we've got these looming deficits, that that was the better position to take. And the American people were persuaded by that.But the fact of the matter is, I haven't persuaded the Republican Party. I haven't persuaded Mitch McConnell and I haven't persuaded John Boehner.

However, the way he did it caused real damage to our intelligence capabilities. There was a better way. The U.S., despite its flaws, respects the rule of law and privacy.

Could you please address that as well? [SEP] Yes, I'll be glad to address it. That is a misperception. I strongly believe that Ukraine and Georgia should be given MAP, and there's no tradeoffs— period. As a matter of fact, I told that to President Putin on my phone call with him recently. I said: You just got to know, I'm headed to Bucharest with the idea in mind of getting MAP for Ukraine and Georgia. And you shouldn't fear that, Mr. President. I mean, after all, NATO is a organization that's peaceful, or NATO is an organization that helps democracies flourish.

This job is unlike any other. It's a constant barrage of information, challenges, and problems. And that's more true now than ever, because of how connected the world is. Fifty years ago, a tragedy in Syria might not have even registered with the American people. Now, they see graphic images instantly.

The most important thing is how you staff your team, especially your Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and White House Counsel. You need a system to surface information and generate options, understanding that the president makes the final call.

The framework, if implemented, will prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, but the details are crucial. Tough negotiations lie ahead, as I've stated from the beginning.

On Cuba, we didn't discuss the specific details you mentioned. I will review the state sponsor of terrorism recommendation, and Congress will have an opportunity to review it as well.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, having just reinforced the U.S.-Japan alliance and articulated a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, how can the U.S. champion freedom and openness in this region without inevitably clashing with China? Prime Minister, did the President express any dissatisfaction regarding Japan's decision not to intercept the North Korean missile, and what message did you convey concerning Japan's role in its own defense? [SEP] Mark, to add to the Prime Minister's response, he will be in a position to intercept those missiles once he finalizes the purchase of additional military hardware from the United States. He will readily intercept them, much like we successfully intercepted a missile in Saudi Arabia recently. It was a remarkably swift missile, akin to hitting a needle in the sky, and it was neutralized instantly without causing any damage. Therefore, I believe it's crucial to acknowledge that the Prime Minister of Japan is poised to acquire substantial quantities of military equipment, as he should. And we produce the finest military equipment, bar none. He will be procuring it from the United States, whether it's the F-35 fighter, which boasts unparalleled stealth capabilities, or various types of missiles, which translates into numerous jobs for us and enhanced security for Japan and other nations that are also purchasing significant amounts of military equipment from us, something that wasn't happening a year or two ago. As for China, my relationship with President Xi is excellent. I hold him in high regard and consider him a friend, and he reciprocates that sentiment. However, he represents China, while I represent the United States. Our perspectives may differ, but we share similar views on trade. The issue with China is that for decades, the trade relationship has been exceedingly unfair, to put it mildly, under previous administrations. Our trade deficit is enormous, ranging from $350 billion to $504 billion annually, and that excludes intellectual property. We've already initiated discussions with China to rectify this imbalance, which necessitates free, fair, or reciprocal trade. Personally, I favor reciprocal trade. It's more easily understood. When you explain that tariffs will be imposed to level the playing field, or other measures will be taken, some people may not grasp it. But when you emphasize reciprocity—that we will charge the same tariffs that they charge us—even those who oppose a 5-percent or 10-percent tariff concede that reciprocity is fair, even if it amounts to 100 percent. So, reciprocal trade is far more comprehensible, Mark, and it's of utmost importance to me. Many countries, not just China or Japan, are guilty of this. We have countries that impose a hundred-percent tax on our goods, while we impose nothing on theirs. I've long opposed this, and we will take action. However, it takes time due to statutory limitations. Notices must be issued, and waiting periods observed. But much of this has already been addressed. You will witness strong action against countries that have been treating the United States, its workers, and its companies unfairly. I view companies as extensions of the workforce. This action has already commenced, and the legal groundwork is complete. You will see a significant change very soon, as the United States has been treated unfairly in trade for far too long. Thank you very much. Regarding Japan's defense equipment, we purchase a considerable amount from the United States. Given the escalating tensions with North Korea and the precarious security situation in the Asia-Pacific region, we must qualitatively and quantitatively enhance our defense capabilities. The F-35A and SM-3 Block IIA are prime examples of acquisitions from the United States. Aegis vessels also require enhancement in both quality and quantity. In this process, we will be procuring more from the United States. That is my intention. Now, concerning North Korea: We tracked the missiles immediately after their launch and were able to ascertain their trajectory. Missile defense is a collaborative endeavor between Japan and the United States. The missile defense system is a joint effort. If interception and shooting down become necessary, we will certainly do so, but in close coordination with the U.S.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders. And I said, we have to stop that. We have to stop it, at least as it pertains to the United States. And I think we're understanding each other.With China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent on $250 billion.But in the meantime, we're working with China very much on the virus. We feel that's something. And I have to tell—I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is—he is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he's going to do well.Now you see it's going to South Korea, it's going to Italy, and it's going to other places.

I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in between countries, where people weren't going to take them, and they're Americans. But they're fully quarantined. They call it fully quarantined. So you know, we did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country—these were wonderful people. It wasn't their fault.So—but we're down to—we're really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now.

We're committed to transferring increasing responsibility to the Afghans, with a full transition and the end of our combat role by the end of 2014. Our coalition partners are on board and sticking to the plan. At the upcoming NATO meeting, we'll focus on ensuring a smooth transition, avoiding a 'cliff' effect. Like our drawdown in Iraq, this will be a gradual process, building Afghan capacity and strengthening partnerships with Afghan security forces. We'll also establish the necessary support structures for the overall strategy to succeed. The Koran burning incident is concerning and highlights the challenges in Afghanistan, underscoring the need for transition. While violence against our people is unacceptable, President Karzai is eager for greater Afghan responsibility.

And if so, where do you see areas globally where the Chancellor and Germany can do more?And, Madam Chancellor, addressed to you, Germany is, after all, actually being praised in America through its economic might, its progress. Does this mean, however, also that it entails certain enhanced responsibilities and where you have to live up to responsibilities, or do you think Germany needs to do more in the future? [SEP] With respect to the Medal of Freedom, it certainly is a recognition of the Chancellor's remarkable career. I think not only has she been an excellent steward of the German economy and the European project, but she represents the unification of Europe through her own life story and the capacity to overcome the past and point towards a brighter future.So the extraordinary work that she's already done, I think, would by itself merit the Medal of Freedom. Fortunately, she's going to be around quite a bit longer. And so she's going to be doing outstanding work in the future. Her leadership will be critical on economic issues of the sort that we just discussed in the euro zone. And I very much compliment her on the courage with which she approaches some of these very difficult political issues, at some significant political costs to herself.On the international stage, there's no issues that we don't coordinate closely with Germany. And our work in Afghanistan, our work together with NATO, the approach that we've taken with respect to the Middle East and the Arab Spring, our approaches to development issues and how we help the poorest countries find their place in the international economy, these are all going to be areas where, I think, Angela's leadership will be welcomed and will be absolutely critical for us to be able to achieve the kind of more peaceful and prosperous world that we want to see.So she's not finished yet; she's got a lot more work to do. I know sometimes she probably wouldn't mind a couple of days off, but she'll have to wait for that.. Well, I believe when you see me standing here before you today and receiving this prestigious award of the Medal of Freedom, it will perhaps also be a moment where one needs to look back to 1989 and German unification and what actually happened there.If you like, Germany entered into a qualitatively new phase. We were all of a sudden a reunited country, a country with all rights, but also with all the obligations.If I think back to the beginning of the nineties, we were struggling for a decision that would enable us to send ships on the Adria, taking part in reconnaissance missions. And if you compare this to where we are today, you see the road that we have traveled in the direction of assuming more international responsibility. Military missions, participating in military missions are part and parcel of that: on the Balkans, in UNIFIL, in Afghanistan, in combating piracy, and in many other areas.But what's also important in this context--and that's an approach that we both share, Barack and I--is that we need to combine military and civil engagement. And so I think we live up to our international responsibilities. The world is full of problems that we need to address. That's a reality, and you cannot have enough partners that work together with you in a coordinated way, and this is why this cooperation is so extremely important for our common future.I'm saying this also as someone who comes from Europe. The changes in North Africa are changes that happen on our doorstep. Those are our immediate neighbors, and we have a choice. Either this works out well or we have an enormous refugee problem.And so it's not only out of charity that we help people. There's not only a moral obligation.

We've conducted more tests than any nation on Earth, surpassing even India and China. Our testing is superior. They all inquire about our methods. The sheer volume of our testing – exceeding 65 million individuals – naturally yields a higher case count. Many nations, such as Mexico, conduct minimal testing, focusing solely on symptomatic individuals. We lead the world in testing. Our performance has been exemplary, including the rapid production of ventilators. We are the world's ventilator leader, now supplying the globe.

We're working on a Security Council resolution. I spoke with Secretary Rice about it this morning. The message? Iran's isolating itself. My message to the Iranian people: You deserve better. A leader who builds your economy, not one chasing nukes. There's a better path. Syria, same deal. We've talked to them. We've laid out what they need to do to improve relations. It's not rocket science. Stop letting those Saddam loyalists send money and weapons into Iraq. Leave Lebanon alone. Prime Minister Siniora's doing a fantastic job, standing up to Syria and Hezbollah.

And since you've now had a chance to talk since July with your legal advisers, what do you now believe are your limits so that you can continue to be—act as President and not as emperor or king? [SEP] Well, the—actually, my position hasn't changed. When I was talking to the advocates, their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress. And getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities. There are certain things I cannot do. There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws.And what we've continued to do is to talk to Office of Legal Counsel that's responsible for telling us what the rules are, what the scope of our operations are, and determining where it is appropriate for us to say we're not going to deport 11 million people. On the other hand, we've got severe resource constraints right now at the border not in apprehending people, but in processing and having enough immigration judges and so forth. And so what's within our authority to do in reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we can't do everything. And it's on that basis that I'll be making a decision about any executive actions that I might take.I will repeat what I have said before: There is a very simple solution to this perception that somehow I'm exercising too much executive authority. Pass a bill I can sign on this issue. If Congress passes a law that solves our border problems, improves our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here, working in our kitchens, working in farms, making beds in hotels—everybody knows they're there; we're not going to deport all of them; we'd like to see them being able, out in the open, to pay their taxes, pay a penalty, get right with the law—give me a bill that addresses those issues, I'll be the first one to sign it, and metaphorically, I'll crumple up whatever executive actions that we take and we'll toss them in the wastebasket, because we will now have a law that addresses these issues.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, looking back at the past year, after the Republicans lost control of Congress, you expressed a desire to find common ground. However, today you delivered a rather critical assessment of the Democrats. How would you evaluate your own performance in working with the Democrats over the past year? How successful have you been in collaborating with them on various issues, and do you believe you've done a satisfactory job in finding common ground? [SEP] We're finding common ground on Iraq. I know some in Congress say we shouldn't have been there, but the debate has shifted. David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker's testimony made a difference. I hope we keep finding common ground by funding our troops. We found common ground on FISA. Why change a good law? It works for national security. That's what people want, laws that help them. This law helps our intelligence find out what Al Qaida is up to. It needs to be enhanced by giving liability protection to the phone companies that helped us. So, we found common ground there. Hopefully, we can find more as Congress moves bills forward. I said what I said because there's a lot to do. I'm not a legislator, probably wouldn't be a good one. But as head of the executive branch, I need to call on Congress to make progress. It's hard to find common ground when bills aren't moving. Not one appropriations bill has reached my desk. How can you find common ground without an appropriations process? We found common ground on trade bills, really important. Exports helped us overcome the housing market weakness last quarter. So, let's open up markets. But no trade bills are moving. Veterans Affairs is another area. I asked Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead a Commission to make sure veterans get the benefits they deserve. I was worried about bureaucratic delays and a system that didn't recognize the nature of this war. I don't like seeing wives sitting by their husbands' beds in Walter Reed without government support.

{"sentence": "As you prepare for your final foreign trip, what assurances can you give world leaders regarding your successor, given their expressed concerns about Donald Trump and the future of U.S. foreign policy? Furthermore, as the Democratic Party seeks to recover from a significant setback, what guidance would you offer regarding the party's future direction and leadership? [SEP] Well, one of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.", "label": "Implicit"}

And President Calderon, what did you discuss with President Fox during your lunch? [SEP] They talked about... Excuse me, I wasn't there. That's a valid question: why now? The legislative process in the U.S. takes time. Legislators debate issues before reaching solutions. We haven't had a serious migration debate until recently. A law passed in 1986, but serious debate began after 2000. As Governor of Texas, I've always known this is an important issue and have elevated it. Congress has taken it seriously, but complex issues are hard to legislate. Many Americans felt we weren't enforcing our laws. We've shown a strong commitment to the rule of law, making Congress more open to my argument: migration reform reduces illegal border crossings, enhancing border security and allowing us to focus on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns. I'm optimistic. I don't predict legislative success, but the mood in Congress has shifted from skepticism to understanding that a comprehensive bill is in the nation's interest. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are working together, facilitated by the administration. I'm not a betting man, but I'm optimistic about comprehensive reform. It's in both countries' interests. I met with former President Vicente Fox, whom I like, and we had a constructive conversation. He congratulated us on our first 100 days and offered his cooperation.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with respect, aren't you essentially kicking the can down the road with this plan? Is there a concrete timeline for implementation, say, by August?

The appropriations bills tend to dominate the calendar towards the end of the year, consuming a lot of time. So, my hope – and it's just a hope, not a promise – is that we can get something through the Senate and then to the House, so they can work out the details in the fall. That would be ideal. But I'm not the one who sets the schedule. I'm just a member of the executive branch. It's the legislative branch that decides the calendar. As for the Guatemalan people, they might have preferred a clearer and more positive response, like an end to deportations. But, as I've said, there's a legal framework that needs to be respected.

{"sentence": "Q. I know what your answer has been. But do you think now, with the rising prices, the record high oil prices, it's time to change course? [SEP] In this case, I have analyzed the issue. And I don't think it would affect price for this reason: We're buying, at the moment, about 67,000 to 68,000 barrels of oil per day, fulfilling statutory obligations to fill up the SPRO. World demand is 85 million barrels a day. So the purchases for SPRO account for one-tenth of one percent of global demand. And I don't think that's going to affect price, when you affect one-tenth of one percent. And I do believe it is in our national interest to get the SPRO filled in case there's a major disruption of crude oil around the world.I mean, one of the—for example, one of the things the—Al Qaida would like to do is blow up oil facilities. Understanding we're in a global market, a attack on an oil facility in a major oil exporting country would affect the economies of their enemy—that would be us and other people who can't stand what Al Qaida stands for. And therefore, the SPRO is necessary, if that's the case, to be able to deal with that kind of contingency. And if I thought it would affect the price of oil positively, I'd seriously consider it. But when you're talking about one-tenth of one percent of global demand, I think the—if you—on a cost-benefit analysis, I don't think you get any benefits from making the decision. I do think it costs you oil in the case of a national security risk.Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News].", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Ukraine, if the cease-fire holds, will the US and Europe ease sanctions? Or are sanctions still needed?

[SEP] We hope the cease-fire works, but we're wary given past actions by separatists and Russia. It needs to be proven. Europe is finalizing its sanctions. Implementing President Poroshenko's plan will take time. So, keeping sanctions in place, but being ready to lift them if the plan is followed, is the best way to ensure compliance. This cease-fire is only happening because of existing sanctions and the threat of more, which are hurting Russia's economy and isolating them. Russia can rejoin the international community by respecting international law. The strong transatlantic alliance supporting Ukraine and imposing sanctions shows how seriously we take the principle that big countries can't bully smaller ones. I'm pleased with our work on the Ukraine crisis, and US leadership has been key. On the Rapid Response Forces, I announced $1 billion in Warsaw. A lot of that will go to the readiness action plan. We've increased troop rotations in the Baltics and have air policing and activities in the Baltic and Black Seas. This plan adds to that, coordinates it better, and gets more help from partners.

We've already proposed significant cuts to the baseline spending, demonstrating our commitment to fiscal responsibility. However, it's not just about cutting spending; it's about looking at the whole picture, including revenue. Would you only consider cutting expenses when balancing your household budget? We must also address the tax structure. My Republican colleagues' insistence on maintaining the Trump administration's tax cuts, which disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans and negatively impacted the economy, is unacceptable.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, looking back, what was the most unexpected aspect of becoming president? How long did it take you to feel truly settled into the role, if ever? And did you discuss these experiences with President-elect Trump? [SEP] Well, I'd say I just started feeling comfortable about a week ago. Just kidding! The learning process is never-ending. This job is truly unique. It's a constant stream of information, challenges, and issues. That's even more true now because of the interconnectedness of the world. If you were president 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even have registered with the American people. Today, they see vivid images instantly. A financial crisis in Southeast Asia used to have no impact on our markets; today, it does. The amount of incoming information that any administration has to deal with today, and respond to much more rapidly than ever before, makes it different. I was watching a documentary where JFK had about two weeks before anyone reported on the Bay of Pigs crisis. Imagine that! Today, a president has about an hour to figure out their response. These are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any president coming in needs to think about. Probably the most important point that I made was how you staff – particularly your Chief of Staff, your National Security Advisor, your White House Counsel – how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a president, understanding that, ultimately, the president is going to be the final decision-maker. That's something that has to be attended to right away. I have been blessed by having – and I admittedly am biased – some of the smartest, hardest-working, good people in my administration that I think any president has ever had. As a consequence of that team, I've been able to make good decisions. If you don't have that around you, then you'll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice. What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the president for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election – all those things are important and should be thought about. I think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together. But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. How he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns – I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he's actually taken office.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "President Obama, given the apparent stagnation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress, and other nations awaiting U.S. leadership in approving the agreement, are you considering a revised strategy for securing its passage, particularly in light of the Boeing and GE deals announced today? Should the agreement be amended to address currency manipulation? Also, your comments on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and Pakistan's concerns about the strike on its soil? Does this signal a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you concerned about a more hardline leader emerging? [SEP] Well, on TPP, I’ve been around long enough to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal. And especially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it. Having said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done. And the reason I'm confident is because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good for the world. And I know I've sold this to you before, but let me reiterate: This is the fastest growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market for the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In other words, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest growing markets of the world, that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers. Number two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulations. Well, if you're signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice, to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts, the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries. So I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. And I'm confident we will get it passed. Now, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korean free trade agreement or the Colombian and Panamanian free trade agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although it will—there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way. With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not something that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way. But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them. On the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I'd like to ask about two topics. First of all, what more specifically can the U.S. do to help Kenya in the fight against al-Shabaab? Do you still see Somalia as a counterterrorism model? And are you concerned about Kenyan authorities using counterterrorism as an excuse to commit human rights violations?Secondly, can you comment on the state of gay and lesbian—the treatment of gay and lesbians in Kenya, which rights groups have called dismal and President Kenyatta has called a nonissue?For you, sir, President Kenyatta, on the same themes, what more do you need from the United States to help fight al-Shabaab, and are you getting it? And can you please also respond to criticism about the state of gay rights in your country? [SEP] Well, this was an extensive topic of conversation and concrete action that we're now taking. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya dealing with primarily threats from al-Shabaab.In part because of the actions that we've taken not just with Kenya, but with AFRICOM, and the efforts, collectively, of countries to work together—Uganda, Ethiopia, others—we have systematically reduced the territory that al-Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa.That doesn't mean the problem is solved. As is true around the world, what we find is, is that we can degrade significantly the capacities of these terrorist organizations, but they can still do damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall were not large, but when they're willing to target soft targets and civilians, and are prepared to die, they can still do a lot of damage.And so what we discussed was the importance of, number one, continuing the effort to root out al-Shabaab's capacity inside of Somalia, working jointly. And as we speak, Kenya is working with Ethiopia and with the United States and others to further degrade al-Shabaab's space of operations inside of Somalia. So we have to keep that pressure going, even as we're strengthening the Somalian Government. Because part of the reason that al-Shabaab was able to emerge as a significant threat to the region was a nonfunctioning Government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long.There is now a Government and a cabinet that is credible and is working with the international community in Mogadishu. And even as we put military pressure on al-Shabaab, we also have to make sure that we're standing up an effective governance structure inside of Somalia. And we've made progress there.In addition, we have to continue to make progress in intelligence-sharing and being able to identify and prevent threats before they occur here in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. And part of our announcement today involves additional funding, additional assistance that we're providing the Kenyan security forces to deal with these very specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to make sure that the approach that's taken in rooting out potential terrorist threats don't create more problems than they're solving.And this goes to the other element of the question that you asked. What we have found, sometimes through hard experience—and I shared this with —is that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you are restricting legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, then that can have the inadvertent effect of actually increasing the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in communities that feel marginalized.And I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, part of the reason why, although we're seeing potential lone wolf attacks inside the United States, that we have not seen this sort of systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim communities or immigrant communities inside of the United States is, is that we've been very conscious to make sure that law enforcement is reaching out and cooperating and working with them, because they are our partners in this process. And the only way we're going to fight the poison that's being fed to them—to their young people through social media—is to make sure that they're our eyes and our ears and they're counseling us on how we can more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. And that's proven successful.The same will be true here in Kenya. And I was very clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people, and it will find its way through this process in cooperation with us, but our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society—in fact, embracing civil society, particularly in those communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab—that becomes more important the more significant the threat is. And not only is that practical advice, but it's the right thing to do, and it's consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and with the values that you heard espouse.Similarly, with respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this. I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. And I say that, recognizing that there may be people who have different religious or cultural beliefs. But the issue is, how does the state operate relative to people?If you look at the history of countries around the world, when you start treating people differently—not because of any harm they're doing anybody, but because they are different—that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. And when a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread.And as an African American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there's—were all sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong.So I'm unequivocal on this. If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs—[]—and doing all the other things that good citizens are supposed to do and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong.

Why are you still convinced a civilian trial is right for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? Why has it stalled? And will Guantanamo remain open for another year? [SEP] We've delivered on many campaign promises, but closing Guantanamo is one where we've fallen short. I wanted it closed sooner, but the politics are difficult. I firmly believe the American justice system is strong enough to convict those who murdered Americans and carried out terrorist attacks. We can lock them up and ensure they never see the light of day. We've done it before. But this issue has generated a lot of political rhetoric, and people are understandably fearful. However, we are a resilient nation and shouldn't be frightened by a handful of captured terrorists. There may be circumstances where a military tribunal is appropriate, for example, when evidence is difficult to piece together for an Article III court. We can reform the military commission system to meet high standards of due process. I'm prepared to work with both parties to set up a sensible system for prosecuting terrorists in either Article III courts or military tribunals, and then imprison them in secure facilities. The cost of holding them in Guantanamo is massively higher.", "label": "Deflection"}

And if not, why wouldn't other countries see that as an incentive not to sign on to the treaty that you say is important to strengthen? [SEP] Well, Scott, initially, you were talking about U.S. behavior, and then suddenly, we were talking about Israel. Let me talk about the United States. I do think that as part of the NPT, our obligation as the largest nuclear power in the world is to take steps to reducing our nuclear stockpile. And that's what the START Treaty was about, sending a message that we are going to meet our obligations.And as far as Israel goes, I'm not going to comment on their program. What I'm going to point to is the fact that consistently we have urged all countries to become members of the NPT.So there's no contradiction there. We think it is important that we have a international approach that is universal and that rests on three pillars: that those of us who have nuclear weapons are making serious efforts to reduce those stockpiles; that we all are working against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons make the decision not to pursue nuclear weapons; and that all countries have access to peaceful nuclear energy.And so whether we're talking about Israel or any other country, we think that becoming part of the NPT is important.

That's been a consistent position of the United States Government even prior to my administration.Let me call on Stephen Collinson of AFP [Agence France-Presse].", "label": "General"}

It's simply incompatible with religious principles. That's why, if you analyze the polls—although I don't place much faith in them—our numbers are trending upward, while Joe's are declining. He'll likely need to emerge from his basement soon. But no, take a look at their manifesto. It's even further to the left than Bernie ever was. It's a disastrous prospect for our country.

President Park has been talking about the Korean Peninsula trust-building process as a way to promote peace on Korean Peninsula. I wonder what you feel about this trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula? [SEP] Well, as I indicated before, 's approach is very compatible with my approach and the approach that we have been taking together for several years now. And as I understand it, the key is that we will be prepared for a deterrence that we will respond to aggression, that we will not reward provocative actions, but that we will maintain an openness to an engagement process when we see North Korea taking steps that would indicate that it is following a different path. And that's exactly the right approach.All of us would benefit from a North Korea that transformed itself. Certainly, the people of North Korea would benefit. South Korea would be even stronger in a less tense environment on the Peninsula. All the surrounding neighbors would welcome such a transition, such a transformation. But I don't think either or I are naive about the difficulties of that taking place. And we've got to see action before we can have confidence that that, in fact, is the path that North Korea intends to take.But the one thing I want to emphasize just based on the excellent meetings and consultation that we had today, as well as watching over the last several months dealing with the provocative escalations that have been taking place in North Korea, what I'm very confident about is, is tough. I think she has a very clear, realistic view of the situation, but she also has the wisdom to believe that conflict is not inevitable and is not preferable. And that's true on the Korean Peninsula. That's true around the world.And we very much appreciate her visit and look forward to excellent cooperation not only on this issue, but on the more positive issues of economic and commercial ties between our two countries, educational exchanges, work on energy, climate change, helping other countries develop.I've had a wonderful time every time I've visited the Republic of Korea. And what is clear is that the Republic of Korea is one of the great success stories of our lifetime. And the Republic of Korea's leadership around the globe will be increasingly important.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given Russia's food import ban and Secretary Hagel's concerns about a potential invasion of Ukraine, does this suggest that the current sanctions regime is not achieving its objectives? [SEP] It's premature to conclude that the sanctions are ineffective. They are designed to apply considerable pressure to the Russian economy. If one considers the financial markets, the outflow of capital, and the projected growth rates, it becomes evident that the Russian economy has largely stagnated. The flight of capital has been substantial, and new investors are hesitant to enter the Russian market. This situation presents President Putin with a critical decision: to pursue diplomatic solutions to the issues in eastern Ukraine, recognizing Ukraine's sovereignty, or to persist on his current trajectory, which will ultimately be detrimental to his economy and his people. We are acting in accordance with our strategic objectives, and we are gratified that our European allies and partners are aligned with us in this effort. However, the underlying problem remains unresolved. Hostilities continue, civilians are losing their lives, and we have witnessed the tragic consequences in the loss of the Malaysian airliner.

I want to follow up on what you were saying about ISIL and ask, if you think that the objective here is to destroy and degrade them, are those the same thing in your mind? Is the goal to ultimately—Secretary Kerry said that there's no containing them, so is the goal to ultimately annihilate them? And also, you talked about the importance of expertise on the ground and building up capacity on the ground. Do you think since airstrikes are not going to do it here, if ultimately, action is needed in Syria, can you realistically expect the Free Syrian Army to do what's needed on the ground to really destroy, not just push back, ISIL? [SEP] You can't contain an organization that is running roughshod through that much territory, causing that much havoc, displacing that many people, killing that many innocents, enslaving that many women. The goal has to be to dismantle them.And if you look at what happened with Al Qaida in the FATA, where their primary base was, you initially push them back. You systematically degrade their capabilities. You narrow their scope of action. You slowly shrink the space, the territory that they may control. You take out their leadership. And over time, they are not able to conduct the same kinds of terrorist attacks as they once could.As I said, I think, in my last press conference, given the nature of these organizations, are there potentially remnants of an organization that are still running around and hiding and still potentially plotting? Absolutely. And we will continue to hunt them down the same way we're doing with remnants of Al Qaida in the FATA or elements of al-Shabaab in Somalia or terrorists who operate anywhere around the world.But what we can accomplish is to dismantle this network, this force that has claimed to control this much territory, so that they can't do us harm. And that's going to be our objective. And as I said before, I'm pleased to see that there's unanimity among our friends and allies that that is a worthy goal and they are prepared to work with us in accomplishing that goal.With respect to the situation on the ground in Syria, we will not be placing U.S. ground troops to try to control the areas that are part of the conflict inside of Syria. I don't think that's necessary for us to accomplish our goal. We are going to have to find effective partners on the ground to push back against ISIL. And the moderate coalition there is one that we can work with. We have experience working with many of them. They have been, to some degree, outgunned and outmanned, and that's why it's important for us to work with our friends and allies to support them more effectively. But keep in mind that when you have U.S. forces, other advanced nations going after ISIL and putting them on the defensive and putting them on the run, it's pretty remarkable what then ground forces can do, even if initially they were on the defensive against ISIL.So that is a developing strategy that we are going to be consulting with our friends, our allies, our regional partners.

I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy--solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal--that country is going to win the race in the 21st-century global economy. So we have to move in that direction.What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth, produce jobs, make sure our businesses are competitive around the world, that we're going to need some of the old, traditional energy sources as we're developing these new ones and ramping them up. All right? So we can't overnight convert to an all-solar or an all-wind economy. That just can't happen. We're going to have needs in these traditional sources.And so the question then is, are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe, secure nuclear power, that includes new technologies so that we can use coal, which we have in abundance and is very cheap but often is adding to our greenhouse gases? Can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up? Can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable? And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy.And you know, my hope is that my Republican friends, but also Democrats, say to themselves, let's be practical and let's do both. Let's not just do one or the other, let's do both.

The loan program--guaranteed loan program that you talked about was giving out $38 billion in guaranteed loans and promised to save or create 65,000 jobs, green jobs, in clean energy, and there's been reports that actually only 3,500 new jobs have been created in that industry. Why has that industry been so slow to respond to the investment that your administration has provided? And what do you see going forward as to how it will respond? [SEP] Well, I think that what has been true historically is that businesses that rely on new technologies, often--a lot of times it's going to take a while before they get takeoff. And there are a lot of upfront investments that have to be made in research and capital and so forth, a lot of barriers for companies that are trying to break in. Keep in mind that clean energy companies are competing against traditional energy companies. And traditional energy is still cheaper in a lot of ways.The problem is, is it's running out, it's polluting, and we know that demand is going to keep on increasing so that if we don't prepare now, if we don't invest now, if we don't get on top of technologies now, we're going to be facing 20 years from now China and India having a billion new drivers on the road, the trendlines in terms of oil prices, coal, et cetera, going up, the impact on the planet increasing. And we're not just going to be able to start when all heck is breaking loose and say, boy, we better find some new energy sources.So in the meantime, we've got to make these investments, but that makes it more difficult for a lot of these companies to succeed. What's also a problem, as I said, is that other countries are subsidizing these industries much more aggressively than we are. Hundreds of billions of dollars the Chinese Government is pouring into the clean energy sector, partly because they're projecting what's going to happen 10 or 20 years from now.So look, I have confidence in American businesses and American technology and American scientists and entrepreneurs being able to win that competition. We are not going to be duplicating the kind of system that they have in China where they are basically state-run banks giving money to state-run companies and ignoring losses and ignoring bad management. But there is a role to play for us to make sure that these companies can at least have a fighting shot. And it does mean that there are going to be some that aren't successful, and it's going to be an uphill climb for some.

We are not a deadbeat nation. There's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. If the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don't have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I'm happily to take it. But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done. There are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me, you need to fund our Defense Department at such and such a level; you need to send out Social Security checks; you need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans. They lay all this out for me, and because they have the spending power. And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills. Separately, they also have to authorize the raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can't do is tell me to spend X, and then say, but we're not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, if you were to choose the second option of the 2 trillion dollar package, would that need to include some form of stimulus, such as a payroll tax extension or the extension of unemployment insurance, for you to sign it? [SEP] A payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance are both beneficial for the economy. A payroll tax cut put money in the pockets of the average American family and offset some of the rising costs in gasoline and food. American consumers and businesses would benefit from a continuation of that tax cut next year. Unemployment insurance is important because unemployment is still too high. Many people are doing everything they can to find a job, but the market is still tight. We need to make sure that they are able to stay in their homes and support their families, which is important and contributes to the overall economy. We can take a little over a trillion dollars in serious discretionary cuts, meaningful discretionary cuts, and then start building on top of that some cuts in non-health-care mandatory payments, ethanol programs, or how we calculate various subsidies to various industries. That could potentially be layered on. And we could still do something like a tax cut for ordinary families that would end up benefiting the economy as a whole. That is not my preferable option, though. I think about this like a layer cake. You can do the bare minimum, and then you can make some progressively harder decisions to solve the problem more and more.

Yet, you're very positive about your relationship with Xi. Can you tell us, is it a friend or a foe?And on North Korea—the sanctions, if they don't work, are all options still on the table? Can I get your answer and also the Prime Minister's thoughts? [SEP] Well, to the second, we'll have to see. I don't think I'm going to exactly play that card. But we'll have to see. If the sanctions don't work, we'll have to go phase two. And phase two may be a very rough thing. May be very, very unfortunate for the world. But hopefully the sanctions will work. We have tremendous support all around the world for what we're doing. It really is a rogue nation. If we can make a deal, it'll be a great thing. And if we can't, something will have to happen. So we'll see.As far as General Mattis is concerned, I mean, he has that view, and a lot of people have that view. China is tough. They're getting stronger. They're getting stronger to a large extent, with a lot of the money they've made from having poor leadership in the United States, because the United States leadership has allowed them to get away with murder.With that being said, I think we can have a truly great even trading relationship with China. Hopefully that's going to work out. And hopefully the relationship I have with President Xi will make that happen. Only time will tell. Thank you. Well, I can confirm that President Trump and President Xi see eye-to-eye in every respect. And they have a—it's very clear at the meetings I've been at, which we've attended in the region—the East Asia Summit, and so forth, APEC—the respect that they have with each other. And I think it's the most—single most important relationship—between China and the United States. It's clearly very respectful, very frank, very clear-eyed.For our own part, we see China's rise as being overwhelmingly a positive for the region and for the world. The critical thing, of course, is the rule of law is maintained. You know, that is the—there are people that want to try to paint the United States and its allies, like Australia, as being against China in some sort of rerun of the cold war. That is not appropriate. It's not accurate.What we need to ensure is that the rules of the road, the rule of law, the rules-based system, where big countries can't push around little countries; where, to quote Lee Kuan Yew all those years ago, where you don't have a world where the big fish eat the little fish and the little fish eat the shrimps. Where you have that rule of law that protects everybody, that is what has enabled the great growth in our region. That's what's enabled hundreds of millions of people in our region, and including in China, to be lifted out of poverty. So maintaining that rules-based order is what we are committed to, and we all have a vested interest in doing so.And I just want to say again, to the President, that the—that his presence—his own personal presence in our region at the end of last year was—sent such a powerful message. The regular visits by Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, and of course, the presence of the United States Navy and so many other manifestations of American commitment to the region is so important to maintaining that rules-based order. Believe me, that has been the foundation of the success, the prosperity, and the security these last 40 or more years. I don't think we've ever had a better relationship with China than we do right now. The only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it's so one-sided, it's so lopsided. And the people that stood here for many years in this position, right where I am right now, should never have allowed that to happen. It's very unfair to the United States, and it's very unfair to the workers of the United States. Very, very unfair.And even today, it's extremely hard on companies that want to do business in China, because the barriers are incredible, whereas the barriers coming into our country are foolishly not. Foolishly. I believe in reciprocal trade. If they do something to us, we do something to them. Well, that never happened. And it's gotten worse and worse over the years. But we'll correct it. That can be the only thing that can get in the way of a truly long-term, great relationship. Because we have all the ingredients for friendship.From the Washington Examiner, Gabby [Gabby Morrongiello, Washington Examiner].", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. The Commerce Department reported today that the housing starts last month fell to the lowest level since 1993. How concerned are you that this housing recession will spill over into the broader economy, and what more can be done to prevent that from happening? [SEP] Ed, I'm encouraged by the rate of inflation, the job growth. We've had 49 consecutive months of uninterrupted job growth, which is a record here in America. I'm pleased with the fact that our deficit is shrinking. But like our Secretary of the Treasury, I recognize there's softness in the housing market. By the way, we had growth in the GDP because of exports. In other words, there's positive elements of our economy. But no question, the housing is soft.And the fundamental question is, what do we do to help homeowners? I don't think we ought to be providing bailouts for lenders, but I do think we ought to put policy in place that help people stay in their home. And that's why this FHA modernization bill is really important, because it'll extend the reach of the FHA and to help more people be able to refinance their homes.Part of the issue in the housing market has been that as a result of asset bundling, that it's hard sometimes for people to find somebody to talk to, to help them refinance. In other words, in the old days, you go into your savings and loan, your local savings and loan, and sit down and negotiate a house deal, and the person with whom you negotiated would be around if you had financial difficulties, to say, can't you help me restructure? Today, the originator of the note no longer owns the note in many cases.And the securitization of mortgages actually provided a lot of liquidity in the market, and that's a good thing. But it also creates a issue here in America, and that is, how do we get people to understand the nature of the mortgages they bought, and how do you help people refinance to stay in home—stay in their home? And so that's what Secretary Paulson, Secretary Jackson have been working on, particularly with the private sector, to facilitate the ability to people to refinance.And finally, we need to change the tax laws. You're disadvantaged if you refinance your home. It creates a tax liability. And if we want people staying in their homes, then it seems like to me, we got to change the Tax Code. That's why I talked to Senator Stabenow the other day and thanked her for her sponsorship of an important piece of tax legislation that will enable people to more likely stay in their homes.So there's some things we can do, Ed. In the meantime, you just got to understand, it's going to have to work out; when you got more houses than you got buyers, the price tends to go down. And we're just going to have to work through the issue.

{"sentence": "Sir, given the current situation with the tunnels, is a realistic ceasefire even possible, or should we rethink our approach? [SEP] Look, the ceasefire that was on the table gave Israel the ability to keep taking out those tunnels, and they can do that without flattening Gaza. Those tunnels have to go. There's a way to do it without so much bloodshed. You see the costs in these conflicts. Kids are getting killed, women are getting killed, Israelis are living in fear. These are costs we can avoid if we get a ceasefire that protects Israel and guarantees they won't be constantly under rocket fire, while also recognizing the Palestinians' need to live a decent life. It's hard, there's a lot of anger and despair, but we have to keep trying. That's what American leadership is all about. These crises might have some risks for us, like with ISIS, but mostly, they aren't direct threats. We care because we have responsibilities. We have to be realistic about what we can do. We've been at war for a decade, and our resources are stretched thin. Still, we try. When John Kerry is out there trying to get a ceasefire, we should be supporting him, not complaining that it hasn't happened yet. Nobody else is even trying.

{"sentence": "Q. Have you--you've talked with economists, you said that economists have agreed that a deal needs to be made. Have you worked with new U.S. business leaders at all to lobby Congress to raise the debt ceiling? And if so, who are you talking to? [SEP] I have spoken extensively to business leaders. And I'll be honest with you: I think that business leaders in the abstract want to see a resolution to this problem. What I've found is that they are somewhat hesitant to weigh in on some of these issues even if they're willing to say something privately to me, partly because they've got a whole bunch of business pending before Congress and they don't want to make anybody mad.So this is a problem of our politics and our politicians, but it's not exclusively a problem of our politics and our politicians. I mean, the business community is a lot like everybody else, which is we want to cut everybody else's stuff and we want to keep our stuff. We want to cut our taxes, but if you want to raise revenue with somebody else's taxes, that's okay. And that kind of mindset is why we never get the problem solved.There have been business leaders, like Warren Buffett, who I think have spoken out forcefully on this issue. I think some of the folks who participated in the Bowles-Simpson Commission made very clear that they would agree to a balanced approach even if it meant for them, individually, that they were seeing slightly higher taxes on their income, given that they're--I think the average CEO, if I'm not mistaken, saw a 23-percent raise this past year while the average worker saw a 0- to 1-percent raise last year.So I think that there are a lot of well-meaning businesspeople out there who recognize the need to make something happen. But I think that they've been hesitant to be as straightforward as I'd like when it says, this is what a balanced package means. It means that we've got some spending cuts, it means that we've got some increased revenue, and it means that we're taking on some of the drivers of our long-term debt and deficits.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

And why not send multinational peacekeepers to the Ukrainian border as a deterrent?And to you, Mr. Prime Minister, the President said yesterday that the U.S. would defend any NATO ally. Are you making that same commitment when it comes to Russia? [SEP] That's a lot of questions there, Jim. [] Do the Italian journalists, by the way, do this—these sort of five-part questions? [] Same thing?[.] I can't say about Italian journalism. [] The—all right, let me try to remember this. In terms of the meeting with His Holiness Pope Francis, we had a wide-ranging discussion. I would say that the largest bulk of the time was discussing two central concerns of his. One is the issues of the poor, the marginalized, those without opportunity, and growing inequality.And those of us as politicians have the task of trying to come up with policies to address issues, but His Holiness has the capacity to open people's eyes and make sure they're seeing that this is an issue. And he's discussed in the past, I think, the dangers of indifference or cynicism when it comes to our ability to reach out to those less fortunate or those locked out of opportunity.And then we spent a lot of time talking about the challenges of conflict and how elusive peace is around the world. There was some specific focus on the Middle East, where His Holiness has a deep interest in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but also what's happening in Syria, what's happening in Lebanon, and the potential persecution of Christians. And I reaffirmed that it is central to U.S. foreign policy that we protect the interests of religious minorities around the world.But we also touched on regions like Latin America, where there's been tremendous progress in many countries, but there's been less progress in others.I think what—the theme that stitched our conversation together was a belief that in politics and in life, the quality of empathy, the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes and to care for someone even if they don't look like you or talk like you or share your philosophy, that that's critical. It's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It's the lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets. And obviously, central to my Christian faith is a belief in treating others as they—I'd have them treat me. And what's, I think, created so much love and excitement for His Holiness has been that he seems to live this and shows that joy continuously.In terms of domestic issues, the two issues that we touched on—other than the fact that I invited and urged him to come visit the United States, telling him that people would be overjoyed to see him—was immigration reform. And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he was very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported, and are separated from families. I described to him how I felt that there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.And he actually did not touch, in detail, on the Affordable Care Act. In my Cardinal—in my meeting with his Secretary of State, Cardinal Parolin, we discussed briefly the issue of making sure that conscience and religious freedom was observed in the context of applying the law. And I explained to him that most religious organizations are entirely exempt. Religiously affiliated hospitals or universities or NGOs simply have to attest that they have a religious objection, in which case they are not required to provide contraception, although employees of theirs who choose are able to obtain it through the insurance company.And I pledged to continue to dialogue with the U.S. Conference of Bishops to make sure that we can strike the right balance, making sure that not only everybody has health care, but families, and women in particular, are able to enjoy the kind of health care coverage that the ACA offers, but that religious freedom is still observed.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Syria, did your discussions with President Putin and President Hu reveal any willingness on their part for Assad to relinquish power, and did you achieve any concrete steps towards ending the violence? [SEP] Well, Syria was definitely a key focus in both meetings. The situation there, as everyone knows, is spiraling out of control, with civilians being targeted and Assad having clearly lost any claim to legitimacy. When you resort to massacres against your own people, it becomes impossible to imagine a peaceful transition that includes Assad. Now, achieving that transition is a complex matter. Russia, with its historical ties to Syria, and China, generally hesitant to interfere in other nations' internal affairs, have been reluctant to apply the necessary pressure. Our conversations were frank. While the U.S. and the international community aren't fully aligned with Russia and China on this, I believe they recognize the dangers of a full-blown civil war. I don't believe they condone the massacres, and they understand that a mechanism for ending the violence and establishing a legitimate government would benefit everyone. I've emphasized the importance of working with the UN and Kofi Annan on a political transition plan. Hopefully, we can continue these discussions and present a clear path forward to the Syrian people. However, it's premature to say that Russia and China are fully on board. They acknowledge the gravity of the situation and its negative impact on their interests and the Syrian people's. We all agree that helping the Syrian people find a resolution is in everyone's best interest. Personally, I don't see a scenario where Assad remains in power and the violence decreases. He failed to uphold his end of the Annan plan, leading to further escalation and the deaths of innocent civilians. Even the international monitors have had to withdraw due to the violence. While some argue that the opposition is also engaged in violence, the horrifying images from places like Homs are a direct result of the Syrian government's actions, for which Assad is ultimately responsible.", "label": "General"}

They're not going to be easily distracted by political theater. The media environment is so polarized now. People are getting their information from sources that reinforce their existing beliefs. This has fundamentally changed the way politics works. As for the polls, they go up and down. The real question is whether voters are buying into the extreme narratives being pushed by some.

Am I confident about Build Back Better? Absolutely. The press has written it off a million times. I don't think it's dead. I'm confident we'll get what I proposed and what we agreed to in the bipartisan infrastructure deal. I trust the Republican Senators who made promises. They're honorable folks, and I expect them to keep their word. The reconciliation process is how we get every Democrat on board with things like what I announced today.

It's supposed to reduce child poverty by over 40%. We have ways to pay for both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. There might be some last-minute haggling over the funding, but I believe we'll get it done. We talked about China, and we agree they're a competitor in many areas. Trade needs to be fair, with a level playing field and the same rules. We need to be technological leaders. We'll cooperate on things like CHIPS. We need to discuss internet norms and standards. We should coordinate our efforts with China. Our shared values should guide our relationship. On the pandemic, we can only beat it if everyone is vaccinated.

And I think that should send a clear signal to the people of Afghanistan that the transition will be a smooth transition.I expect you'll see more U.S. troops here as quickly as possible in parts of the country that are being challenged by the Taliban. I remember when President Karzai and President Musharraf and I had the famous dinner at the White House. Yes.

I've told President Xi Jinping that they should try to make it clear to North Korea that they shouldn't do these nuclear tests. And I also said that if they do, we'll have to take defensive actions. These actions wouldn't be against China, but they'd send a clear message to North Korea. We're going to defend our allies, our soil, and our capabilities. I'm not sure if China has the power to stop them, but I'm sure they don't want North Korea escalating things. I've made it clear that we'll do what we need to defend ourselves and our allies, like South Korea and Japan. It wouldn't be because of China, but because of North Korea. We're working with China to try to resolve this, but it's not going to be easy. I don't think there's a need to worry about a new Cold War.

[SEP] Government action—if you're talking about bailing out—if your question is, should the Government bail out private enterprise? The answer is, no, it shouldn't. And by the way, the decisions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—I hear some say bailout—I don't think it's a bailout. The shareholders still own the company. That's why I said we want this to continue to be a shareholder-owned company.In this case, there is a feeling that the Government will stand behind mortgages through these two entities.

And in an election year, you can bet there'll be some political grandstanding. But I'm still confident we'll get it done. It's the right thing to do for America, for the region, for the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for us. They already sell their stuff to us with relatively low tariffs, while our goods face higher tariffs over there. This deal gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods. That's a win for American businesses and workers. One of the biggest gripes about trade deals has always been that they open us up to countries with lower wages and weaker labor and environmental standards. TPP tackles that head-on with enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and address environmental issues. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will make us worse off. We're demonstrably better off. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean and Colombian deals. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too. Now, currency manipulation. We've got provisions in TPP that boost transparency and reporting to keep an eye on things. Some folks wanted enforceable tariffs, but it's tough to figure out when currency is actually being manipulated. And frankly, binding other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we're not going to do. But we've beefed up the provisions to put countries on notice if we think they're engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, on Mullah Mansur, his death has been confirmed. He was targeting U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This isn't a change in our approach. We're not re-entering combat. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself.

This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California.And also, recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me that they're afraid and that they are considering leaving not just their State, but the country.Sir, why do you think this is happening? And what do you say to parents, like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore?And then, Prime—Prime Minister Sunak, thank you. You mentioned that AI has been a key part of your visit. What are the U.S. and the U.K.—what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from AI-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors?And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by AI leaders about the potential threat that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale, so far, to deal with climate change, another existential threat? [SEP] Let me answer your first question. First of all, maybe quietly, when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them and let them know that the President and this administration has their back. And I mean that.Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.It's wrong for—that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are—they're gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors.These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel and it's callous. Not somebody else's kids; they're all our kids. They're the kids—and our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.But number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.We're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end—the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.Congress has to pass—and I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass—must pass—the Equality Act and send it to my desk.LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected. Laura, the—on your question, it's clear that AI can bring incredible and will bring incredible benefits to society, our economies, to all of us. And actually, one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point very eloquently yesterday.And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against.Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue.

We didn't have—as an example, bringing back the remains. That was not one of the things that was on our agenda today. I brought that up at the very end because so many people have talked to me about it. And I brought it up at the very end. And he was really very gracious. Instead of saying, Well, let's talk about it the next time. He said: It makes sense. We will do it.And he knew—you know, they know where many of those incredible people are. Where they're buried along roads, along highways, along paths, usually, because our soldiers were moving back and forth, and they had to move rapidly. It's very sad. But he knew. And that was brought up at the very end. And you know, it was really great that he was able to do it. A lot of people are going to be very happy about that.Yes.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the constitutional questions surrounding some of your decisions, do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? What about the debt limit? And is marriage a civil right? [SEP] That's a real mixed bag of legal questions, Chuck. You should be clerking for the Supreme Court. Look, I'm not a constitutional scholar. Let's focus on Libya. There's been a lot of noise about process and congressional consultation. Let's talk about what's actually happening. Qadhafi, a major sponsor of terrorism, was threatening his own people. We joined an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate, to take out his air defenses. This allowed a no-fly zone to protect civilians. I told the American people we wouldn't put troops on the ground and that our allies would carry the bulk of the load. We've done exactly what I said. No boots on the ground, and our allies have stepped up. We've protected thousands in Benghazi, with no U.S. casualties and no escalation. It's a limited operation. We consulted with Congress extensively. This fuss is mostly political. We acted under a U.N. mandate and saved lives. Qadhafi is now pinned down. The War Powers Resolution came about after Vietnam, when Congress wanted more control over military commitments. Consultation is appropriate. But do I think we violated the War Powers Resolution? No. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the vast sums already allocated, what key performance indicators will definitively demonstrate the success of your economic recovery initiatives? Specifically, what metrics should the American public monitor to assess progress, and within what timeframe should tangible results be expected? Furthermore, is there a contingency plan in place should these initial efforts prove insufficient? [SEP] The most crucial indicator is job creation. Increased employment fosters consumer confidence, driving spending and business investment, thereby creating a positive feedback loop. Secondly, the effective functioning of credit markets is paramount. Numerous viable businesses are currently hampered by a lack of access to credit. Thirdly, stabilizing the housing market is essential. Although the federal government's control is limited, our strategy, in collaboration with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, seeks to mitigate foreclosures and stabilize housing values. The ultimate measure of success is transitioning from economic contraction and job losses to a period of sustained growth and job creation.

And do you hold any real hope for collaboration with this Congress in the coming year? [SEP] In my assessment, they are failing to serve the interests of the American people. Regarding FISA, it is perplexing that the Protect America Act, which was enacted in August of 2007, is not considered relevant in 2008. Despite the expiration of the act, the underlying threat persists. This suggests either a deficiency in leadership or a lack of comprehension, neither of which is conducive to the well-being of the nation. It is imperative that we provide our professionals with the necessary resources to safeguard the American populace. Furthermore, the Colombia free trade agreement presents an opportunity to bolster our economy, as many goods from Colombia enter our country duty-free, while our goods are subject to tariffs. The American people rightfully expect reciprocity in trade relations. This agreement would facilitate increased exports, thereby benefiting midsized and small businesses. Rather than engaging in political maneuvering, Congress should acknowledge the benefits for our economy, workers, and small businesses. I find myself perplexed by the lack of action on these critical issues. Both FISA, which safeguards America, and the Colombia agreement, which promotes economic growth, are of paramount importance to all Americans, regardless of their political affiliation.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "Q. [Inaudible][Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this—some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President López Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me—this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzmán? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC? [SEP] Very well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country—and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America—to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants—the smugglers—the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks—truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the—constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We—what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people—just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime—because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this—Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working—we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more—and well-being—to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico—any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken—made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended—will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything—risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is—a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that—I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were—those were the main migration flows from Central America—but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States—40 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program—a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery—35,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers—1,554 kilometers—in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region—which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world—well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others—other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect—I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had—the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth—we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's—we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is—we're even ashamed to mention this, that—to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service—in the past—were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace—to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, your budget needs more taxes from companies that move jobs out and from oil and gas. You've wanted this for ages. If you couldn't do it with Democrats in charge, why now? And does it mess up your plan for corporate tax reform that doesn't add to the deficit? [SEP] I still think I'm right, so we're giving it another shot. The thing is, everyone's saying they're serious about the deficit now. If that's true, we gotta look at unfair spending through the tax code, tax breaks that don't help us compete or make jobs here. Most experts would say the stuff you mentioned doesn't help us grow. If that's the case, why are we letting some folks pay less than those who are making jobs and investing here? Why aren't we putting money into future energy, not just the old stuff, especially if the old stuff is making bank and doesn't need a break? If we're serious about cutting the deficit, we need to look at everything. We can't just pick and choose. Same goes for the Democrats. Some things in this budget are tough for me. Cities and states are hurting because they're not making as much money. They have more to do because people lost jobs, and the housing market's a mess. But this budget cuts money for communities by 10 percent. I don't like it, but I'm saying yes. Everyone needs to give a little.

[SEP] Well, I wouldn't say I suggested a bailout, but it's certainly an industry that's been severely affected by the virus. It's a great industry, a very important industry, and we'll be helping them. And we'll be helping the airline industry, if necessary – assuming it becomes necessary. So far, they haven't asked.

It's interesting, I was just talking to Doug, and their retail numbers are booming – I guess because of all this, your business is thriving. You've all been selling a lot of stuff. Doug, would you like to address the hand sanitizer question? Sure. Yes, specifically, the areas where we're seeing supply chain pressure are surface cleaners, cleaning supplies, and paper goods. Hand sanitizer will be difficult to keep fully stocked for some time. We're still replenishing and shipping it, but it's selling out as soon as it hits the stores.

And do you see any path toward the war ending with Putin still in power? [SEP] First of all, no one can join NATO while the war—a war is going on, where a NATO nation is being attacked, because that guarantees that we're in a war and we're in a third world war. So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said moments ago that Americans should not give in to fear when it comes to these terrorist attacks. But you also said that the person who may have been the person behind thinking about the attacks is not a mastermind and that anybody who can get their hands on some conventional weapons can—and is willing to die can blow themselves up. How should Americans feel, then, if they shouldn't be scared?And if I may, the Washington Post and ABC News just this week came out with a poll that said 83 percent of the voting public believes that an attack, a terrorist attack on—against the U.S. with mass casualties is likely to happen in the near future, and 40 percent say it's very likely. Does that in your mind—given the fact that you think the public should not be so fearful—mean that the terrorists are winning? And do you believe that this is sort of the new normal and Americans will have to live with this kind of fear? [SEP] David, I think that the American people are in—are right to be concerned, and to expect that we in the Government and in law enforcement are doing everything we can to disrupt terrorist attacks, to intercept intelligence that may lead us to individuals who are willing to carry out these attacks, that we make sure that these terrorists are not gaining the kinds of weaponry that would make it easier for them to cause mass attacks. This is a serious problem. And as somebody who, more often than I would like, have met with or comforted families of victims of terrorism, the losses are real, and they're devastating. So this is a serious problem. And we have to work collectively across the board, as we've been doing since I became President and since previous administrations identified the kinds of organized terrorist activity like Al Qaida that we've seen—we've got to do everything we can to stop it.But there is a difference between being vigilant and being concerned and taking this seriously and taking precautions and, in some cases, changing our security arrangements, as we've done, for example, in aviation. There's a difference between smart applications of law enforcement and military and intelligence and succumbing to the kind of fear that leads us to abandon our values, to abandon how we live, to abandon—or change how we treat each other.And the good news is, there, Americans actually have been resilient. They've been tested. We had a mass casualty attack on 9/11. And as I said before, I was very proud of the fact that the fundamental nature of America and how we treated each other did not change.I think we made some bad decisions subsequent to that attack in part based on fear, and that's why we have to be cautious about it. We have to think things through. But overall, the American people went about their lives. Times Square is filled with people—rightly so. After the Boston bombing attack, folks went right back to the ballpark and sang, Take Me Out to the Ballgame. That's what they needed to do.And so the message I have is that those of us who are charged with protecting the American people are going to do everything we can to destroy this particular network. Once this network is destroyed—and it will be—there may be others that pop up in different parts of the world, and so we're going to have to continue to take seriously how we maintain the infrastructure that we've built to prevent this. But it doesn't have to change the fundamental trajectory of the American people. And that we should feel confident about.And the media needs to help in this. I mean, I just want to say, I—during the course of this week, a very difficult week, it is understandable that this has been a primary focus. But one of the things that has to happen is, how we report on this has to maintain perspective and not empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger.They're a bunch of killers with good social media. And they are dangerous, and they've caused great hardship to people. But the overwhelming majority of people who go about their business every day, the Americans who are building things and making things and teaching and saving lives as firefighters and as police officers and—they're stronger. Our way of life is stronger. We have more to offer. We represent 99.9 percent of humanity.

I'm wondering if you were personally stung, and if you worry about losing support of people—of him and people like him? [SEP] First of all, I respect Matthew. I've known him for awhile. As you mentioned, he was an integral part of my 2004 campaign. I have not talked to Matthew about his concerns. Nevertheless, I understand his anguish over war. I understand that this is an emotional issue for Matthew, as it is a lot of other people in our country. Matthew's case, as I understand it, is obviously intensified because his son is deployable. In other words, he's got a son in the U.S. Armed Forces, and, I mean, I can understand Matthew's concerns.I would hope that people who share Matthew's point of view would understand my concern about what failure would mean to the security of the United States. What I'm worried about is that we leave before the mission is done—and that is a country that is able to govern, sustain, and defend itself—and that Iraq becomes a cauldron of chaos, which will embolden extremists, whether they be Shi'a or Sunni extremists; which would enable extremists to have safe haven from which to plot attacks on America; which could provide new resources for an enemy that wants to harm us.And so, on the one hand, I do fully understand the anguish people go through about this war. And it's not just Matthew; there's a lot of our citizens who are concerned about this war. But I also hope that people will take a sober look at the consequences of failure in Iraq. My main job is to protect the people, and I firmly believe that if we were to leave before the job is done, the enemy would follow us here. And what makes Iraq different from previous struggles is that September the 11th showed that chaos in another part of the world—and/or safe haven for killers, for radicals—affects the security of the United States.Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News].", "label": "Implicit"}

That's why I've asked the Vice President to focus on the root causes of why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. It's earthquakes, floods, lack of food, gang violence, a whole range of things. When I was Vice President, I slowed it down by working with the heads of state to do things like putting lighting in the streets to reduce violent crime. When the hurricanes occurred, instead of helping, we did nothing.

We've done more than ever before, but more is needed. No one at the conference questioned our commitment. They're focused on our actions, from deforestation efforts to Build Back Better. World leaders are now prioritizing climate impact in infrastructure projects. There's reason to worry if we don't continue progress and risk exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise. But I'm optimistic because populations are more aware than at COP25. People are seeing unprecedented events, like flooding in Queens and massive wildfires.

However, what I can assure you is that they are motivated to reach an agreement. This is precisely where my expertise lies. I have a proven track record as a dealmaker, and I possess a keen sense for discerning genuine interest from mere posturing. Many politicians lack this aptitude, but it is a core strength of mine. In truth, this agreement could have been achieved much sooner. However, I have a strong feeling – call it intuition, call it talent – that they are committed to making it a reality.

Our approach is to lead by example and advocate for our values through persuasion. Cuba isn't a direct threat to our national security, but we will continue to address our differences constructively.

{"sentence": "Q.

And obviously, the most recent riots or protests against the Koran burning were tragic, but remember, this happened a while back when a pastor in Florida threatened to burn a Koran. In Iraq, as we were making this transition, there were constant crises that would pop up and tragic events that would take place and there would be occasional setbacks.But what I've tried to do is to set a course, make sure that up and down the chain of command everybody knows what our broader strategy is.

They run—they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense.

And that is going to take a little bit of time.We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in Haiti, and the diaspora could cause some real—how can I say it?—confusion in the Western Hemisphere.And so—but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some.

{"sentence": "Q. Haven't you betrayed some of the voters who supported you in the election by changing your positions on who should get a tax increase and then by including Social Security benefits now in this mix? And more broadly, there seems to be a deepening sense that negotiations aren't going very well right now. Can you give us a candid update? Are we likely to go over the cliff? [SEP] Well, first of all, there's no reason why we should. Remember what I said during the campaign. I thought that it was important for us to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I said it was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires paid their fair share. I said that we were going to have to make some tough cuts, some tough decisions on the spending side, but what I wouldn't do was hurt vulnerable families, only to pay for a tax cut for somebody like me. And what I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases.That's exactly what I've put forward. What I've said is, is that in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things, some things that some Democrats don't want to see, and probably, there are a few Republicans who don't want to see either. But the only way that we're going to be able to stabilize the economy, make sure we've got a platform for long-term economic growth, that we get our deficits under control and we make sure that middle class families are protected is if we come up with something that members of both parties in Congress can support.And that's the plan that I've put forward. I have gone at least halfway in meeting some of the Republicans' concerns, recognizing that even though we campaigned on these issues, even though the majority of Americans agree with me that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest few as a means of reducing the deficit, I have also said that I'm willing to identify some spending cuts that make sense.And frankly, up until about a couple of days ago, if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner, I think, were in a position to say, we've gotten a fair deal. The fact that they haven't taken it yet is puzzling and, I think, a question that you're going to have to address to them.I remain optimistic, though, because if you look at what the Speaker has proposed, he's conceded that income tax rates should go up, except right now he only wants to have them go up for millionaires. If you're making 900,000, somehow he thinks that you can't afford to pay a little more in taxes. But the principle that rates are going to need to go up he's conceded.I've said I'm willing to make some cuts. What separates us is probably a few hundred billion dollars. The idea that we would put our economy at risk because you can't bridge that gap doesn't make a lot of sense.So I'm going to continue to talk to the Speaker and the other leaders up in Congress. But ultimately, they've got to do their job. Right now their job is to make sure that middle class taxes do not go up and that we have a balanced, responsible package of deficit reduction.It is there for all to see. It is a deal that can get done. But it is not going to be—it cannot be done if every side wants 100 percent. And part of what voters were looking for is some compromise up here. That's what folks want. They understand that they're not going to get 100 percent of what they want. And for some reason, that message has not yet taken up on Capitol Hill.And when you think about what we've gone through over the last couple of months—a devastating hurricane and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory—the country deserves folks to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good and not tangle themselves up in a whole bunch of ideological positions that don't make much sense.So I remain not only open to conversations, but I remain eager to get something done. I'd like to get it done before Christmas. There's been a lot of posturing up on Capitol Hill and instead of just going ahead and getting stuff done. And we've been wasting a lot of time. It is the right thing to do. I'm prepared to get it done. But they're going to have to go ahead and make some adjustments.And I'll just give you one other example. The Speaker now is proposing what he calls plan B. So he says, well, this would raise taxes only on folks making a million dollars or more. What that means is an average of a $50,000 tax break for every millionaire out there, at the same time as we're not providing unemployment insurance for 2 million people who are still out there looking for work. It actually means a tax increase for millions of working families across the country at the same time as folks like me would be getting a tax break. That violates the core principles that were debated during the course of this election and that the American people determined was the wrong way to go.And so my hope is, is that the Speaker and his caucus, in conjunction with the other legislative leaders up there, can find a way to make sure that middle class families don't see their taxes go up on January 1; that we make sure that those things that middle class families count on like tax credits for college or making sure that they're getting some help when it comes to raising their kids through things like the child tax credit, that that gets done; and that we have a balanced package for deficit reduction, which is exactly what I've put forward.", "label": "Implicit"}

If not, what constraints are preventing a more decisive intervention, considering the apparent shift in stance compared to other regional uprisings? [SEP] Well, our immediate concern was the safety of American citizens and embassy personnel in Libya, which we successfully addressed. Subsequently, we initiated the most substantial financial asset seizure in our nation's history. Following that, we imposed sanctions and mobilized international support through the UN, gradually intensifying pressure on Qadhafi. He's facing increasing international isolation through sanctions and an arms embargo. Furthermore, we've extended humanitarian aid to assist those crossing into Tunisia and Egypt, and we'll continue this support. Within NATO, we're exploring various options, from continuous surveillance to monitor the situation and respond swiftly to potential deterioration, to reinforcing the arms embargo, providing additional humanitarian assistance, and considering potential military actions, including a no-fly zone. NATO will convene on Tuesday to discuss a no-fly zone, and we've engaged with Arab and African nations to assess their support for such a measure. Secretary Clinton will also meet with the opposition in the coming days, and we're assigning a representative to liaise with them and identify ways to offer further assistance. In essence, all options remain on the table. It's crucial to recognize the speed with which the international coalition has acted to impose sanctions on Qadhafi. I firmly believe that Qadhafi's departure is in the best interest of the United States and, more importantly, the Libyan people. I haven't ruled out any possibilities. However, I take seriously the need for thorough consideration and consultation with Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and relevant personnel before making any decisions involving U.S. military force.

And—but the party's message has got to be that different points of view are included in the party. And take, for example, the immigration debate. That's obviously a highly contentious issue. And the problem with the outcome of the initial round of the debate was that some people said, Well, Republicans don't like immigrants. Now, that may be fair or unfair, but that's what—that's the image that came out.And you know, if the image is we don't like immigrants, then there's probably somebody else out there saying, Well, if they don't like the immigrants, they probably don't like me as well. And so my point was, is that our party has got to be compassionate and broadminded.I remember the 1964 elections. My dad happened to be running for the United States Senate then and, you know, got landslided with the Johnson landslide in the State of Texas.

Did you assure the President that you would sever ties with Al Sadr, and could your government withstand such a separation? [SEP] With respect to Al Sadr, I'll defer to the Prime Minister's insights on that relationship. Our discussion centered on the Iraqi security landscape, a matter of grave concern for both of us. The Prime Minister's primary duty is the safety and security of the Iraqi people. His frustration stems from a lack of adequate resources to address lawbreakers. I was reassured by his dedication to a united, pluralistic society where accountability prevails, regardless of whether the perpetrators are criminals, Al Qaeda, or militia members. He shared his political realities, and I believe he's best positioned to discuss the Sadr group or any other internal factions. Our coalition isn't exclusive; the national unity government comprises various participating entities, representing a collective national responsibility. The Sadrists are merely one component within Parliament and the Government. Participation entails responsibility and mutual commitment, including upholding the Government, Constitution, and the law.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There's a report that your Director of National Intelligence has ordered a broad review—this is regards to the Boston Marathon bombing—that your DNI has ordered a broad review of all the intelligence gathering prior to the attack. There is also a series of senators—Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham—who allege that all these years after 9/11, there still wasn't enough intelligence shared prior to the attack. And now, Lindsey Graham, who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the U.S. going backwards on national security. Is he right? And did our intelligence miss something? [SEP] No, Mr. Graham is not right on this issue, although I'm sure it generated some headlines.I think that what we saw in Boston was State, local, Federal officials, every agency rallying around a city that had been attacked, identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined. We now have one individual deceased, one in custody. Charges have been brought.I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place. And we should be very proud of their work, as obviously we're proud of the people of Boston and all the first responders and the medical personnel that helped save lives.What we also know is that the Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists. The FBI investigated that older brother. It's not as if the FBI did nothing. They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother. They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity. So that much we know.And the question then is, was there something that happened that triggered radicalization and actualan actual decision by the brother to engage in the attack that wethe tragic attack we actually saw in Boston? And are there thingsadditional things that could have been done in that interim that might have prevented it?Now, what Director Clapper is doing is standard procedure around here, which is when an event like this happens, we want to go back and we want to review every step that was taken. We want to leave no stone unturned. We want to see, is there, in fact, additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack? And we won't know that until that review is completed. We won't know that until the investigation of the actual crime is fully completed. And that's still ongoing.But what I can say is, is that based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing.But this is hard stuff. And I've said for quite some time that because of the pressure that we've put on Al aida core, because of the pressure that we've put on these networks that are well financed and more sophisticated and can engage in and project transnational threats against the United States, one of the dangers that we now face are self-radicalized individuals who are already here in the United States, in some cases, may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have, may decide to carry out an attack. And those are in some ways more difficult to prevent.And so what I've done for months now is to indicate to our entire counterterrorism team, what more can we do on that threat that is looming on the horizon? Are there more things that we can do, whether it's engaging in communitiesengaging with communities where there's a potential for self-radicalization at thisof this sort? Is there work that can be done in terms of detection?

{"sentence": "Mr. President, President-elect Trump has mentioned the possibility of easing sanctions on Russia in exchange for significant reductions in their nuclear arsenal. Considering your own efforts in arms control, do you believe this is a sound strategy? Given your experience in office and your understanding of Mr. Trump's approach, what advice would you give his advisors to help him effectively manage his relationship with Vladimir Putin? And in light of your recent actions concerning Russia, do you think these sanctions should be viewed as leverage in future negotiations? [SEP] Well, let's break this down. First, it's in America's and the world's interest to have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my presidency. Where we've had common ground, we've worked together. Early in my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive player on the world stage, helping them diversify and strengthen their economy, and use the talents of the Russian people in more productive ways. However, it's fair to say that after President Putin came back into the presidency, an escalating anti-American rhetoric and a global approach seemingly based on the idea that anything America does must be bad for Russia, leading them to counteract our efforts, has revived a Cold War-era adversarial spirit, making the relationship more difficult. This was further solidified when Russia intervened in Crimea and parts of Ukraine. The sanctions, as you recall, weren't about nuclear weapons. They were a response to the violation of Ukraine's independence and sovereignty through force by Russia. This wasn't just our view; it was the view of the entire international community. Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory, meddle in Ukrainian affairs, and support military proxies who have violated fundamental international law and norms. I've told the Russians that the sanctions will be lifted as soon as they stop doing that. To maintain international norms, it's crucial that we don't confuse the reasons for these sanctions with other issues. On nuclear matters, we negotiated the START II Treaty during my first term, significantly reducing nuclear stockpiles for both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further, and I told President Putin that, but they weren't willing to negotiate. If President-elect Trump can restart those talks in a serious way, there's still considerable potential for further stockpile reductions. Our success in nonproliferation and nuclear security has been partly due to leading by example. I hope that continues. However, it's essential to remember that the sanctions against Russia are a direct result of their actions in Ukraine. The United States must uphold the fundamental principle that larger countries cannot invade and bully smaller ones. I've said before that I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship, given their historical, cultural, and social ties. However, Ukraine is an independent nation. This situation exemplifies the vital role America must continue to play in preserving basic norms and values globally, whether advocating for human rights, women's rights, or freedom of the press. The United States hasn't always been perfect in this regard. At times, we must engage with allies and partners who may not fully meet our desired standards for international rules and norms. However, I can assure you that in every multilateral forum—the United Nations, the G-20, the G-7—the United States has consistently championed these values. It's crucial for us to continue doing so, because if the largest, strongest democracy in the world isn't willing to stand up for these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "Q. I appreciate you making it a slow news week. [Laughter]I wanted to ask you about your evolution on the surveillance issues. I mean, part of what you're talking about today is restoring the public trust. And the public has seen you evolve from when you were in the U.S. Senate to now. And even as recently as June, you said that these—the process was such that people should be comfortable with it, and now you're saying you're making these reforms and people should be comfortable with those. So why should the public trust you on this issue? And why did you change your position multiple times? [SEP] Well, I think it's important to say, Carol, first of all, I haven't evolved in my assessment of the actual programs. I consistently have said that when I came into office, I evaluated them. Some of these programs I had been critical of when I was in the Senate. When I looked through specifically what was being done, my determination was that the two programs in particular that had been at issue, 215 and 702, offered valuable intelligence that helps us protect the American people, and they're worth preserving. What we also saw was that some bolts needed to be tightened up on some of the programs, so we initiated some additional oversight, reforms, compliance officers, audits, and so forth.And if you look at the reports—even the disclosures that Mr. Snowden has put forward—all the stories that have been written, what you're not reading about is the Government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's e-mails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused. Now, part of the reason they're not abused is because these checks are in place and those abuses would be against the law and would be against the orders of the FISC.Having said that, though, if you are outside of the intelligence community, if you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S.—Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, et cetera, well, understandably, people would be concerned. I would be too if I wasn't inside the Government.And so in light of the changed environment where a whole set of questions have been raised, some in the most sensationalized manner possible, where these leaks are released, drip by drip, one a week, to kind of maximize attention and see if they can catch us at some imprecision on something; in light of that, it makes sense for us to go ahead, lay out what exactly we're doing, have a discussion with Congress, have a discussion with industry—which is also impacted by this—have a discussion with civil libertarians and see, can we do this better?I think the main thing I want to emphasize is, I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task. We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that. And we've tried to set up a system that is as failsafe as so far at least we've been able to think of to make sure that these programs are not abused.But people may have better ideas, and people may want to jigger slightly, sort of, the balance between the information that we can get versus the incremental encroachments on privacy that, if haven't already taken place, might take place in a future administration or as technologies develop further.And the other thing that's happening is, is that as technology develops further, technology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So, for example, if people don't have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress are sufficient to give us confidence that Government's not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what Government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological fixes that provide another layer of assurance.And so those are the kinds of things that I'm looking forward to having a conversation about.", "label": "Implicit"}

There was a way to have this debate without causing that damage. The U.S., despite its flaws, respects the rule of law, privacy, and civil liberties. Because of these disclosures, countries that actually do the things Snowden was worried about are able to criticize the U.S. That's a distorted view.

These measures have had a tangible impact. Three million individuals have jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. The economy would be in a far worse state. However, we're not yet where we need to be.

And more importantly, as the President said, we probably also have to invest our time and even resources in the monitoring and also preventing problems coming up, as they keep coming up in different places.But it is important to understand that, indeed, today we'll have Darfur; maybe tomorrow there will be another problem area, God forbid. But it's important that these problems are not to be seen as if they have to be resolved, attended to, by the United States. They must be attended to by the international community. They must also be attended to by people, if it is in Africa, by Africans. Primarily, they must develop this capacity. And they should be supported to develop this capacity so that we can prevent and we are prepared to prevent. Then you should be able to cope with these challenges, resolving the problems.So I think the approach taken by President Bush were realistic, in the sense that you also do not want to see every problem, United States being called upon to be the answer of that problem. And of course, we—the backlash, also, in the sense that, at the same time, they also start blaming the United States, that they are rushing everywhere solving problems and, of course, reading through that to mean they have other interests and so on and so forth.So I think that will lead the way of helping the people to solve their own problems, but of course, with the support of the United States with its huge capabilities in different areas. And walking together with the rest of the international community is perhaps more important than just blaming the United States, saying, Why didn't you go in and solve the problem? The problems and the solutions to those problems should not be taken away from the responsibilities of their action, should not be taken away from places where they're taking place and the people in those places.I think that is the best way I could— but we did talk about that. And we did talk about our own contribution and to how that can be enhanced. And the President is willing to support us—support has always been coming—so that we continue to move forward.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering your comments on a return to decency, do you believe this election marks a genuine turning point away from the intense polarization of the last few years? [SEP] Well, I don't anticipate a change of heart among the super-mega-MAGA Republicans. However, I believe they represent a minority within the Republican Party. The vast majority of Republicans, while we may hold differing views on various issues, are decent and honorable individuals. We have disagreements on matters of policy. But I've worked with many of these individuals in the Senate and the House for an extended period. They are honest and straightforward. Their perspectives may differ from mine, but they are, nonetheless, decent people. Consequently, I believe that the rest of the world, and many of you have reported from other parts of the world, is observing the United States. Perhaps the most effective way to articulate this is to reiterate something I've shared previously. At the first G-7 meeting, representing the seven largest democracies, which I attended shortly after my inauguration in January, I sat down at a roundtable with the six other world leaders from the European Union, Canada, and others, and declared, 'America is back.' One of them turned to me and asked, 'For how long?' It was a profoundly earnest question. And I looked at them. Then another individual, whom I won't name, proceeded to ask, 'What would you say, Joe, if you went to bed tonight in England, only to wake up the next morning to discover that thousands of people had stormed the Parliament of Great Britain, breached the doors, resulting in the deaths of two police officers, injuries to numerous individuals, and an attempt to halt the confirmation of an election?' It's not the same situation, obviously, as we have. And he said, What would you think? And what—I ask the rhetorical question: What would you all think? You'd think England was really in trouble. You'd think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain. And so that's the way people were looking at us, like, When is this going to stop? Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don't want to exaggerate. But literally, nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. And so what I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we're about? Are we the same democracy we've always been? Because, look, the rest of the world looks to us—I don't mean that we're always—like we're always right. But if the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change. And so they're very concerned that we are still the open democracy we've been and that we have rules and the institutions matter. And that's the context in which I think that they're looking at: Are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the Court, by the Congress, by the Government, et cetera?", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, you head back to the United States with the task of convincing the American people and Congress on two major foreign policy initiatives—the framework for a nuclear deal with Iran and, likely soon, the decision to remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terror. Recently, remarks by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei have raised doubts among some as to whether that deal can occur in Iran. And Senator Schumer, an ally of yours, has—wants Congress to have the right to vote on removal of sanctions. Presidential politics are likely to play a part in this Cuba decision inevitably. So I'm wondering if it would take a lot of political capital just to get one done, let alone two. Have you bitten off more than you can chew? [SEP] No. [] You may be surprised by that response, Jim. Let me take them in turn.First of all, with respect to Cuba, there is majority support of our policy in the United States, and there's overwhelming support for our policy in Cuba. I think people recognize that if you keep on doing something for 50 years and it doesn't work, you should try something new.And so the American people don't need to be persuaded that this is, in fact, the right thing to do. I recognize that there are still concerns and questions that Congress may have; we've got concerns and questions about specific activities that are taking place in Cuba and human rights and reform. And there were two members of the Cuban civil society that were in attendance at the meeting that I had yesterday who expressed much of what they have to go through on a day-to-day basis. They were supportive of our policy of engagement with Cuba.And so I don't think that it's so much we have to persuade anybody. The issue of the state sponsor of terrorism list, as you know, the State Department has provided a recommendation; it's gone through our interagency process. I'll be honest with you, I have been on the road, and I want to make sure that I have a chance to read it, study it, before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be.But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people-to-people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for the Cuban people.Now, with respect to Iran, I have always been clear: We are not done yet. What we were able to obtain was a political framework between the P-5-plus-1 nations and Iran that provided unprecedented verification of what is taking place in Iran over the next two decades that significantly cuts back on its centrifuges, that cuts off pathways for it to obtain a nuclear weapon, and that calls for, in return, the rolling back of sanctions in a phased way that allows us to snap back if Iran violates the agreement. That's the political framework. That was not just something that the United States and Iran agreed to, but Iran agreed to a political framework with the other P-5-plus-1 nations.Now, what's always been clear is, is that Iran has its own politics around this issue. They have their own hardliners. They have their own countervailing impulses in terms of whether or not to go forward with something, just as we have in our country. And so it's not surprising to me that the Supreme Leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position. But I know what was discussed at—in arriving at the political agreement.What I've always said, though, is that there's the possibility of backsliding. There's the possibility that it doesn't get memorialized in a way that satisfies us that we're able to verify that, in fact, Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon and that we are preserving the capacity to snap back sanctions in the event that they are breaking any deal.And that's why the work is going to be so important between now and the end of June to memorialize this so that we can all examine it. And we don't have to speculate on what the meaning of a deal is going to be. Either there's going to be a document that Iran agrees with the world community about and a series of actions that have to be taken, or there's not. Part of the challenge in this whole process has been, opponents of basically any deal with Iran have constantly tried to characterize what the deal is without seeing it.Now, if we are able to obtain a final deal that comports with the political agreement—and I say if because that's not yet final—then I'm absolutely positive that that is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And that's not my opinion; that's the opinion of people like Ernie Moniz, my Secretary of Energy, who is a physicist from MIT and actually knows something about this stuff. That's the opinion of a whole bunch of nuclear experts who examined the deal.I mean, very rarely do you see a consensus—consensus too strong a word—a large majority of people who are experts in the field saying this is actually a realistic, plausible, meaningful approach to cut off the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon and that it is more likely to succeed not only than maintaining current sanctions or additional sanctions, but more likely to succeed than if we took a military approach to solving the problem.Again, that's not uniquely my opinion. That is—talk to the people who are not affiliated with the administration, some of whom were skeptical about our capacity to get a deal done and have now looked at it and said if we're able to actually get what was discussed in the political framework, it's absolutely the right thing to do.Now, there's politics and political pressure inside of the United States. We all know that. The Prime Minister of Israel is deeply opposed to it. I think he's made that very clear. And I have repeatedly asked, what is the alternative that you present that you think makes it less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon? And I have yet to obtain a good answer on that.And the narrow question that's going to be presented next week when Congress comes back is, what's Congress's appropriate role in looking at a final deal? And I've talked to not only Bob Corker, but I've talked to Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the Democratic side. And I want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when it's done. What I'm concerned about is making sure that we don't prejudge it or those who are opposed to any deal whatsoever try to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal.Last comment I'm going to make on this: When I hear some, like Senator McCain recently, suggest that our Secretary of State, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this Nation, is somehow less trustworthy in the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries. And we're seeing this again and again. We saw it with the letter by the 47 Senators who communicated directly—[]—to the Supreme Leader of Iran—the person that they say can't be trusted at all—warning him not to trust the United States Government.We have Mitch McConnell trying to tell the world, oh, don't have confidence in the U.S. Government's abilities to fulfill any climate change pledge that we might make. And now we have a Senator suggesting that our Secretary of State is purposely misinterpreting the deal and giving the Supreme Leader of Iran the benefit of the doubt in the interpretations.That's not how we're supposed to run foreign policy, regardless of who is President or Secretary of State. We can have arguments, and there are legitimate arguments to be had. I understand why people might be mistrustful of Iran. I understand why people might oppose the deal, although the reason is not because this is a bad deal per se, but they just don't trust any deal with Iran and may prefer to take a military approach to it.But when you start getting to the point where you are actively communicating that the United States Government and our Secretary of State is somehow spinning presentations in a negotiation with a foreign power, particularly one that you say is your enemy, that's a problem.

Healthcare.gov works really well now; 1.2 million people used the window-shopping function since Sunday. There were 23,000 applications completed in just the first 8 hours and tens of thousands more throughout the day.Health care is working. More than 10 million people have already gotten health insurance; millions more are eligible. And contrary to some of the predictions of the naysayers, not only is the program working, but we've actually seen health care inflation lower than it's been in 50 years, which is contributing to us reducing the deficit and has the effect of making premiums for families lower that they otherwise would have been if they have health insurance.

[SEP] The data clearly shows that middle-class incomes haven't kept pace with rising costs for a decade. Meanwhile, the top 1% have amassed wealth at levels unseen since the Roaring Twenties. These are undeniable facts, not political opinions. A strong middle class is the bedrock of the American Dream, and we must focus on creating opportunities for everyone. We celebrate success, like Steve Jobs' innovations, and expect such individuals to prosper in a free market. However, those who are fortunate must contribute to the broader community, ensuring that future generations also have the chance to succeed.

{"sentence": "Q. Do you think you might have emergency powers that you could use after any default situation? [SEP] We have used a lot of our emergency powers. Jack Lew has used extraordinary measures to keep paying our bills over the last several months. But at a certain point, those emergency powers run out, and the clock is ticking. And I do worry that Republicans, but also some Democrats, may think that we've got a bunch of other rabbits in our hat. There comes a point in which, if the Treasury cannot hold auctions to sell Treasury bills, we do not have enough money coming in to pay all our bills on time. It's very straightforward.And I know there's been some discussion, for example, about my powers under the 14th Amendment to go ahead and ignore the debt ceiling law. Setting aside the legal analysis, what matters is, is that if you start having a situation in which there's legal controversy about the U.S. Treasury's authority to issue debt, the damage will have been done even if that were constitutional, because people wouldn't be sure. It would be tied up in litigation for a long time. That's going to make people nervous.So a lot of the strategies that people have talked about—well, the President can roll out a big coin, or he can resort to some other constitutional measure—what people ignore is that, ultimately, what matters is, what do the people who are buying Treasury bills think?And again, I'll just boil it down in very personal terms. If you're buying a house and you're not sure whether the seller has title to the house, you're going to be pretty nervous about buying it. And at minimum, you'd want a much cheaper price to buy that house because you wouldn't be sure whether or not you're going to own it at the end. Most of us would just walk away, because no matter how much we like the house, we'd say to ourselves, the last thing I want is to find out after I've bought it that I don't actually own it.Well, the same thing is true if I'm buying Treasury bills from the U.S. Government. And here I am sitting here, what if there's a Supreme Court case deciding that these aren't valid, that these aren't valid legal instruments obligating the U.S. Government to pay me? I'm going to be stressed, which means I may not purchase them. And if I do purchase them, I'm going to ask for a big premium.So there are no magic bullets here. There's one simple way of doing it, and that is Congress going ahead and voting. And the fact that right now there are votes, I believe, to go ahead and take this drama off the table should at least be tested. Speaker Boehner keeps on saying he doesn't have the votes for it, and what I've said is, put it on the floor, see what happens, and at minimum, let every Member of Congress be on record. Let them vote to keep the Government open or not, and they can determine where they stand and defend that vote to their constituencies. And let them vote on whether or not America should pay its bills or not.And if in fact some of these folks really believe that it's not that big of a deal, they can vote no, and that will be useful information for voters to have. And if it fails, and we do end up defaulting, I think voters should know exactly who voted not to pay our bills so that they can be responsible for the consequences that come with it.Ari Shapiro [National Public Radio].", "label": "Implicit"}

What specifically are the requests you are making of them? [SEP] Sure. First of all, Presidents don't recruit; the people elect a leader with whom I will work.

I had met with him before when he came over here and found him to be a very engaging, energetic, smart, capable person. We will have our differences, and we will have our agreements. And I'm looking forward to working with him.Vice President Cheney is in the Middle East. His first message to the Iraqis was that they have got to speed up their clock, that—I agree with General Petraeus's assessment that there are two clocks: one ticking here in Washington and one ticking there. And they must understand that we are very serious when it comes to them passing law that enables this country to more likely reconcile. And then he'll be traveling to talk to other friends in the area.One of the questions that many ask is, do we understand the Iranian issue well? Do we understand the consequences of Iran having a nuclear weapon—which it looks like they want to try to achieve— to get. And the answer is, absolutely. And they'll find a stalwart friend in dealing with extremism in that vital part of the world. And that—Vice President will lay out our strategy of convincing others to join us in— on this Iranian issue. He will point out to them that we have worked hard to convince not only the EU-3 to join with the United States in sending a clear message but also now Russia and China, and that we do have a diplomatic front. And we've got to work—to continue to work together. We've got to work to keep it together, to send a focused, concerted message.He will also remind people that success in Iraq will be important for dealing with Iran, that if we were to listen to some of the voices in Congress and withdraw before the job was done, it would embolden Iran. In other words, there are strategic consequences to what is being said here in Washington, DC, about the Iraqi issue.And so he's got to—it's a vital trip, and I really appreciate him going.

As you at this summit try to continue the work of stopping Afghanistan from reverting to its former role as a terrorist haven, terrorists today in Yemen massacred a hundred soldiers. Are you concerned that despite U.S. efforts, Yemen seems to be slipping further into anarchy? And what more can the U.S. do to slow that process? [SEP] We are very concerned about Al Qaida activity and extremist activity in . A positive development has been a relatively peaceful political transition in , and we participated diplomatically along with 's neighbors in helping to lead to a political transition, but the work is not yet done.We have established a strong counterterrorism partnership with the i Government, but there's no doubt that in a country that is still poor, that is still unstable, it is attracting a lot of folks that previously might have been in the FATA before we started putting pressure on them there.

It's also important for the stability of and for the region.But I think one of the things that we've learned from the Afghanistan experience is for us to stay focused on the counterterrorism issue, to work with the Government, to not overextend ourselves, to operate smartly in dealing with these issues. And it's not unique to , by the way. I mean we've got similar problems in Somalia, what's happening now in Mali and the Sahel.

And since you've been very clear about a timetable to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq within 16 months, I wonder, what's your timetable to withdraw troops eventually from Afghanistan?And related to that, there's a Pentagon policy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins from coming in to Dover Air Force Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that it was shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into the country under the cover of night. You've promised unprecedented transparency, openness in your Government. Will you overturn that policy so the American people can see the full human cost of war? [SEP] Your question is timely. We got reports that four American servicemembers have been killed in Iraq today, and obviously, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families. I've said before that--you know, people have asked me, When did it hit you that you are now President? And what I told them was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of our fallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carry in this office and the consequences of decisions that you make.Now, with respect to the policy of opening up media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewing those policies in conversations with the Department of Defense, so I don't want to give you an answer now before I've evaluated that review and understand all the implications involved.With respect to Afghanistan, this is going to be a big challenge. I think because of the extraordinary work done by our troops, and some very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, we just saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully. And you get a sense that the political system is now functioning in a meaningful way.You do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national Government seems very detached from what's going on in the surrounding community.In addition, you've got the Taliban and Al Qaida operating in the FATA and these border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and what we haven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safe havens that would ultimately make our mission successful.So we are undergoing a thorough-going review. Not only is General Petraeus now the head of CENTCOM conducting his own review, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sent over, Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats, to evaluate a regional approach. We are going to need more effective coordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts, with development efforts, with more effective coordination, with our allies in order for us to be successful.The bottom line, though--and I just want to remember the American people, because this is going to be difficult--is this is a situation in which a region served as the base to launch an attack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week, I met with families of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs of allowing those safe havens to exist. My bottom line is that we cannot allow Al Qaida to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're going to have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, in order to make sure that those safe havens don't exist. I do not have yet a timetable for how long that's going to take. What I know is, I'm not going to make--I'm not going to allow Al Qaida or bin Laden to operate with impunity, planning attacks on the U.S. homeland.All right. Helene Cooper [New York Times].

And people breathed a sigh of relief when that finally got done, and the next thing they know is, is that the President's health care reform can't get the web site to work and that there are these other problems with respect to cancellation notices.And I understand why folks are frustrated. I would be too. Because sometimes, people look at what's taking place in Washington, and they say, not enough is getting done that helps me with my life.

And I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular, and on a whole range of these issues in general.And that's on me. I mean, we fumbled the rollout on this health care law. There are a whole bunch of things about it that are working really well, which people didn't notice, right, because they weren't controversial: so making sure kids could stay on their parents' plans until they were—through the age of 25, and making sure that seniors got more discounts on their prescription drugs. There were a whole bunch of stuff that we did well over the first 3 years.But we always knew that these marketplaces—creating a place where people can shop and through competition get a better deal for the health insurance that their families need—we always knew that that was going to be complicated and everybody was going to be paying a lot of attention to it.

Yes, I don't think it's a big problem. I don't think it's very many people. I think we had a whistleblower who was a fake.

Could you elaborate on the significance you attribute to fighting greenhouse gases, the rationale behind preventing states from exceeding national regulations, and whether you've recently conferred with Vice President Gore on climate change? [SEP] The core question here is about *efficacy*. We all agree on the *what* – reducing emissions. The debate is on the *how*. Is it more effective to have 50 different approaches, or a coordinated national strategy? Director Johnson's decision was rooted in the fact that this new law gives us a national strategy. We're talking about raising CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, and a major increase in alternative fuels. That's a unified plan. As for Vice President Gore, yes, we spoke, and I assured him I'm taking this seriously. We're building a strategy, and this bill is part of it. Replacing gasoline with alternatives is a big step. The bill I signed wasn't as strong as I wanted, but it's a start. We need to invest in cellulosic ethanol, not just corn. That's a real national plan. But let's be clear: this is a global issue. That's why I opposed Kyoto – China wasn't included. We need major emitters on board. We're working on that, as I explained at the G-8 and in Bali. I take this very seriously, but we can't destroy our economy in the process. We need to be prosperous to invest in new technologies. And if you're serious about greenhouse gases, you should be a strong supporter of nuclear power. It's the best way to generate electricity without emissions. So, we have a strategy: higher CAFE standards, alternative fuels, nuclear power. And we have 250 years of coal, so we need to find ways to use it cleanly.

However, I will say that the debate around surveillance is crucial. We must balance national security with civil liberties.

Simple as that, complicated as that. Am I confident about Build Back Better? Supremely confident that everything will work out perfectly. The press has declared it dead ten times already. I don't think it's dead. I'm confident we'll get what I proposed and agreed to in the bipartisan infrastructure deal. I trust the Republican Senators who made commitments. They're honorable people, and I expect them to keep their word. As for the reconciliation process, that's how we get every Democrat to agree on matters like what I announced today.

It's expected to reduce child poverty by over 40 percent. We have ways to pay for both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. There might be some last-minute discussions about the funding mechanisms, but I believe we'll get it done. We discussed China and agreed that they are a competitor in many areas. Trade with China needs to be fair, with a level playing field and the same rules and standards for everyone. We need to be technological leaders. We'll cooperate on technologies like CHIPS.

At the same time, as far as I know, U.S. had to buy even Russian gas for Boston.I have a question. The implementation of your idea has a political tinge to it, or is this a practical one? Because there will be a gap formed in the supply and demand mechanism, and first it's the consuming countries who will fall into this gap.And the second question: Before the meeting with President Putin, you called him an adversary, a rival, and yet you expressed hope that you will be able to bring this relationship to a new level. Did you manage to do this?

And as I've said before, not everything we do is going to pan out exactly as we hope. This is uncharted territory. While there's a general consensus among economists on the path forward, the need for a substantial recovery package, and a balanced approach, even if we get all of that right, we still have to deal with the financial system, the housing market, and creating a regulatory system that prevents future crises.

{"sentence": "Q. Question of both Presidents: Referring to what has been raised a moment ago, this European initiative—European reassurance initiative, doesn't do away with the division into old and the new members of the alliance. It doesn't mean that the deployment of ground troops of the United States, and Poland and other countries like the Baltic States counted on this very much. So what kind of American troops can we expect in Poland, specifically, within the next months or years? Is it going to be some components of the ground troops? And if so, when are they going to come? [SEP] Well, the—first of all, when you discuss old and new NATO members, I recall my first NATO meeting back in 2009, and I made very clear, at that first meeting, my belief that there's no such thing as new members of NATO and old members of NATO, there are just members of NATO. And because that was my strong view then and continues to be my strong view now, I immediately pushed to make sure that we were putting in place contingency plans for every NATO member. And those contingency plans have been steadily developed over the last several years.And part of what I think your President just indicated is very important is that our contingency plans are not just pieces of paper on a shelf, but we have the capacity to operationalize them. That means that there has to be resources pre-positioned, there has to be training, there have to be joint exercises. We have been conducting those, but there's no doubt that what has happened in Ukraine adds a sense of urgency when we meet in Wales in the next NATO summit.And part of what I discussed with Secretary General of NATO Rasmussen and now with the new Secretary General Stoltenberg is the need to make sure that the collective defense effort is robust, it is ready, it is properly equipped.That does mean that every NATO member has to do its fair share. Obviously, we all have different capacities. The United States is going to have different capacities than Poland; Poland is going to have a different capacity than Latvia. But everyone has the capacity to do their fair share, to do a proportional amount to make sure that we have the resources, the planning, the integration, the training in order to be effective.Some of that has to do with where our personnel is positioned. And obviously, as I indicated before, my administration has put U.S. soldiers on Polish soil for the first time. This new initiative that I'm putting forward gives us the option, the capacity, to add to those rotations.But I think it's important to recognize that the effectiveness of our defenses against any threat is not just going to be dependent on how many troops we have in any particular country; it has to do with how we are working collectively together to make sure that when any NATO member is threatened, all of us can respond rapidly, whether it's through air, sea, or land.And that's going to require some flexibility. It's going to require some additional planning. It's going to require some joint capabilities that right now we don't have. Frankly, NATO is very reliant on U.S. capabilities, but has not always invested in some joint capabilities that would be important as well. And it's going to require every NATO member to step up. We have seen a decline steadily in European defense spending generally. There are exceptions like Poland, like Estonia, but for the most part, we have seen a steady decline. That has to change.The United States is proud to bear its share of the defense of the transatlantic alliance. It is the cornerstone of our security. But we can't do it alone. And we're going to need to make sure that everybody who is a member of NATO has full membership. They expect full membership when it comes to their defense; then that means that they've also got to make a contribution that is commensurate with full membership. President Komorowski. For Poland, what is really fundamental is to make sure that nobody from outside of NATO claims the right to determine what NATO member states may do and what they may not do. And it also concerns the question of the presence of NATO troops and NATO infrastructure in the Polish territory.What is most important for us is to make sure that there are no second-category member states of NATO, that there are no countries about whom an external country—a third country like Russia—can say whether or not American or other allied troops can be deployed to these countries. That is why the decision of the United States of America to deploy American troops to Poland is really very important for us, both as an element of deterrence, but also as a reconfirmation that we do not really accept any limitations concerning the deployment of NATO troops to Poland imposed for some time or suggested for some time by a country that is not member of NATO.Another thing is the inadequacy of response to the existing situation. The Ukrainian crisis, the Russian behavior about Crimea, for example, forced the necessary response to it. And this response is both the real presence of American troops, reinforced aviation detachment, and then the ground troops that are—component, as well as the declaration of President Obama to increase this presence even more. I would like to remind you that Poland is also making a contribution in the reconfirmation of an equal right of every member state to decide whether or not they are going to receive NATO troops in their territories.So Poland is participating in the air policing mission that is a mission to provide security for the air space over the Baltic States. We do it together with other allies from NATO, and we don't ask anybody for acceptance except for what is agreed within NATO internally. The same goes for the Poland's participation in the Afghan operation in ISAF. It was the reconfirmation of full solidarity and full coresponsibility for the decisions which are made not only for the military effort, but also for political decisions. Poland has been and shall continue to be a spokescountry for the solidarity within NATO. And that this can be manifested also in the denial of the right of anyone from outside of NATO to decide whether we can do something or we cannot do it.

Every nation assures me Russia won't have a veto over Bucharest's decisions, and I trust them. That's the right approach. I'm committed to Ukraine and Georgia joining MAP. It's in our, NATO's, and their best interests. On missile defense, I've clearly told President Putin it's not aimed at Russia. They could easily overwhelm it. It's for threats from the Middle East, like our Far East systems protect us from single or dual launches. We need to ease suspicions, but we're making progress. Ukraine's NATO membership is about national interest, not targeting anyone. Our history shows collective defense is vital for sovereignty and integrity. Joining MAP is the best response for Ukraine's future. Debates in Europe shouldn't create obstacles. We're on the right track, acting within our sovereignty. The open-door policy shouldn't be replaced by a veto from a non-member. The discussion is overheated, lacking respect. Wisdom should prevail. I want calmness, stability, and security for Ukraine.

{"sentence": "Q. President Obama, good afternoon. President Santos, good afternoon, sir. President Obama, you are the first U.S. President who comes to Colombia and stays 3 days, 2 nights, in the beautiful city of Cartagena. How should Colombia and the world interpret this gesture? Is it an acknowledgment of the levels of security that we have here? Is it a gesture of trust in what President Santos has done? Or can we interpret it as a new phase beginning in relationships--the relations between two countries?And, President Santos, there are small-businesspeople who are very concerned about the FTA. And what is your plan to deal with that, Mr. President? [SEP] Well, I think the answer is all of the above. It is--this represents my confidence in the security of Colombia and the progress that's been made. It represents my confidence in President Santos and the work that we've done together, as a culmination of the efforts that we began when we first met a couple of years ago. It highlights the deliverables coming out of this summit, not just the free trade agreement, but all the other work that has been done, such as the increase in the length of visitor visas. And it is consistent with the approach that I indicated I would take when I first came into office when it comes to Latin America and Central America.This is a fast-growing part of the world. It is our--one of our largest trading partners, the entire region. We have Colombian Americans, Americans who originate from the Dominican Republic, from Guatemala, from Mexico, who are constantly contributing to the vitality and the strength of the United States. And so there is a natural bond that already exists. And it's important that our governments build on that natural bond for the mutual benefit of both nations.And my expectation is, is that we will continue to see the progress that's been made in this summit in subsequent meetings that we have with Colombia. And I think that Colombia increasingly, precisely because it went through difficult times over these last several years, can end up being a role model for a lot of countries around the region. Because they'll see: You know what, there's hope--even in the midst of violence, even in the midst of difficulty--there's the possibility of breaking through to the other side and achieving greater citizen security and greater prosperity.And let me just mention, I know you asked the question of President Santos, but on the issue of small businesses, one of the things that I brought to the summit was a proposal that, I think, people are embracing throughout the region, and that is that we begin to focus more on small and medium-sized businesses, on women's businesses, making sure that the benefits of trade don't just go to the largest companies, but also go to smaller entrepreneurs and businesspeople.Because in today's globalized world there's an opportunity for a small business or a medium-sized business to access a global marketplace and grow rapidly, and that means more jobs here in Colombia, and that means more jobs in the United States. So we don't want trade to just be taking place at this layer up here. We want it to be taking place at every level because we think that's going to be good for both our economies. You asked me about what contingency plan we had to help companies and people who were going to be adversely affected by the FTA. All free trade agreements have winners and they have losers, and in this case, we have many more winners than losers. Employment wins. We will create jobs in Colombia. We estimate that more than 500,000 jobs will be created. We will benefit economic growth. We will--we have estimated that between .5 and 1 percent will be added to our growth rate over the long term, and that will be translated into benefits for the economy--for the Colombians. And we estimate that everybody will benefit from this.Obviously, there are some sectors that don't traditionally benefit. But small and medium enterprises can be the ones that benefit the most. That happened in Peru, for example, when the Peru-U.S. FTA--we saw a major uptick of the number of SMEs that benefited from this free trade agreement. We hope that that happens in Colombia as well, because thus far, Colombia has per capita exports which are very low. But we still have the great potential to bolster our free trade and our exports in those sectors that are vulnerable--which have been identified as vulnerable--are the focus of a series of policies and efforts that will help them weather the storm, to be transformed, to be more competitive, and to be able to face the competition that will open up with this new FTA. That has happened with every free trade agreement that has been signed in the past. What's important is that the final results yields more benefits than otherwise. And we have no doubts that in this case, it will have more benefits for everyone.", "label": "Explicit"}

Sometimes a military tribunal might be better, like when it's hard to get evidence for a regular court. We can fix the military commission system to make it fair.

{"sentence": "Q. Good morning, Your Excellencies. My question is to President Bush. Looking at Africa from afar, things might look bleak, but all may not be lost yet. A new Africa is emerging. But in your candid view, what do you think Africa must do, and what kind of leadership do you expect to see in Africa? And how will the U.S. help in this regard, to push forward the agenda to transform the continent into a better place for its people?And secondly, what do you hope to achieve from your five-nation tour, and why have you decided to visit Africa on the last lap of your term? And how do you want to ensure continuity in whatever you hope to achieve? [SEP] Thanks. I actually went to Africa on the first lap of my Presidency too. This is my second trip to the continent of Africa, and I've come to remind our fellow citizens that it is in our interest to help countries deal with curable diseases like malaria and difficult diseases like HIV/ AIDS; that it's in our interest to promote trade between the continent of Africa and the United States of America; that it's in our interest to provide education money so governments will educate children.And there's no better way of making that point than to be in Ghana, where people will get to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to be giving speeches in America, it's another thing to actually come to Ghana and meet different folks that are involved with making the—Ghana a better place.Secondly, first of all, Africa has changed since I've been the President, in a very positive way. It's not because of me; it's because of African leaders—I want you to know. But there was six regional conflicts when I became the President. Take Liberia, for example. It was a real issue and a real problem, and along with Nigeria and with John's advice, for example, we—I made some decisions, along with other leaders, that helped put in place the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. And I'm going there tomorrow to herald the successes she's done and to reaffirm our commitment that we'll help.In other words, conflict resolution has been taking place. And the United States hasn't tried to impose a will. We've just tried to be a useful partner, like in eastern Congo, for example, working with the Presidents of Rwanda and Congo and Burundi.Secondly, democracy is making progress across the continent of Africa. One reason why is because there are examples like John Kufuor for people to look at. I'm telling you, the guy is a respected person. People look at him, and they say, this is the kind of leader that we respect.And thirdly, our aid program has changed from one that basically said, here's your money, good luck, to one that said, in return for generosity, we expect there to be certain habits in place, like fighting corruption or investing in the education of children. I don't think that's too much to ask in return for U.S. taxpayers' money. It hasn't been asked in the past. This is a novel approach, interestingly enough. But I feel confident in asking nations to adhere to good principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders.I'm confident in the capacity of the leaders I have met—not every single leader— but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy—a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent. And that's why I'm here, and I'm glad I am here. It's been a great trip, and it's—and I appreciate the hospitality of my friend, and so does Laura.Let's see here, John McKinnon.

And also, how do you respond to their criticism that you punted this issue past the election for political reasons?And, Prime Minister Harper, you seemed to suggest the other day that politics is behind the way the Keystone issue has been handled. Do you really feel that way? [SEP] First of all, any effort to try to try--tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut I will reject. So everybody should be on notice. And the reason is because the payroll tax cut is something that House Republicans, as well as Senate Republicans, should want to do regardless of any other issues. The question is going to be, are they willing to vote against a proposal that ensures that Americans, at a time when the recovery is still fragile, don't see their taxes go up by a thousand dollars? So it shouldn't be held hostage for any other issues that they may be concerned about.And so my warning is not just specific to Keystone. Efforts to tie a whole bunch of other issues to what is something that they should be doing anyway will be rejected by me.With respect to the politics, look, this is a big project with big consequences. We've seen Democrats and Republicans express concerns about it. And it is my job as President of the United States to make sure that a process is followed that examines all the options, looks at all the consequences before a decision is made.Now, that process is moving forward. The State Department is making sure that it crosses all its t's and dots all its i's before making a final determination. And I think it's worth noting, for those who want to try to politicize this issue, that when it comes to domestic energy production, we have gone all in, because our belief is, is that we're going to have to do a whole range of things to make sure that U.S. energy independence exists for a long time to come, U.S. energy security exists for a long time to come.So we have boosted oil production. We are boosting natural gas production. We're looking at a lot of traditional energy sources, even as we insist on transitioning to clean energy. And I think this shouldn't be a Democratic or a Republican issue, this should be an American issue: How do we make sure that we've got the best possible energy mix to benefit our businesses, benefit our workers, but also benefit our families to make sure that the public health and safety of the American people are looked after? And that's what this process is designed to do.[] I think my position, the position of the Government of Canada, on this issue is very well known, and of course, Barack and I have discussed that on many occasions. He's indicated to me, as he's indicated to you today, that he's following a proper project to eventually take that decision here in the United States and that he has an open mind in regards to what the final decision may or may not be.And that's--I take that as his answer.

He and I talk about a lot of things. But I think what he was getting at, and I wouldn't assign a specific percentage to it, is that with problems this big, no single solution is going to solve everything. As I've said before, we're going to try a lot of things, and not all of them will work out exactly as planned. This is uncharted territory. Experts have a general idea of how to move forward, a consensus on the need for a significant recovery package, a mix of tax cuts and investments. But even if we do all that right, we still have to deal with the financial system, get the banks lending, fix the housing situation, and create a regulatory framework that prevents future crises. These are all huge, complicated tasks. So, I'm not sure if that's what Joe was referring to, but it's a good jumping-off point to discuss these broader issues.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Q. Good afternoon, Your Excellencies. This question goes to President Obama, but I would also like to hear the thoughts of President Aquino. I understand the tough balancing act that you need to do between China and your allies in Asia. But do you believe that China's expansionism is a threat to regional peace and stability? And will the mutual defense treaty apply in the event that the territorial conflict with China escalates into an armed conflict? [SEP] Well, let me repeat what I said earlier. I think that it is good for the region and good for the world if is successfully developing, if is lifting more of its people out of poverty. There are a lot of people in , and the more they're able to develop and provide basic needs for their people and work cooperatively with other countries in the region, that's only going to strengthen the region, that's not going to weaken it.I do think that, as President Aquino said very persuasively, that as a large country has already asserted that it is interested in abiding by international law. And really, our message to consistently on a whole range of issues is we want to be a partner with you in upholding international law. In fact, larger countries have a greater responsibility in abiding by international norms and rules because when we move, it can worry smaller countries if we don't do it in a way that's consistent with international law.And I think that there are going to be territorial disputes around the world. Look, some—we have territorial disputes with some of our closest allies. I suspect that there are some islands and rocks in and around Canada and the United States where there are probably still some arguments dating back to the 1800s. But we don't go around sending ships and threatening folks. What we do is, we sit down, and we have some people in a room; it's boring, it's not exciting—[]—but it's usually a good way to work out these problems and work out these issues.And I think that all the countries that I've spoken to in the region during the course of my trip—Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and now the Philippines—their message has been the same everywhere I go, which is, they would like to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically. That's why I think that the approach that President Aquino has been taking, putting this before international arbitration, is a sound one.And if , I think, listens to its neighbors and recognizes that there is another approach to resolve these disputes, what will find is they've got ready and willing partners throughout the Asia region—Asia-Pacific region that want to work with them on trade and commerce and selling goods and buying goods. And it's inevitable that is going to be a dominant power in this region just by sheer size. Nobody, I think, denies that. The question is just whether other countries in the region are also able to succeed and prosper on their own terms and attend to the various interests and needs that they and their people have as well. And that's what we support. Well, I think our—from the onset, our message to has been, I think, we're all focused on achieving greater prosperity for all our respective peoples, and prosperity and continued prosperity does not happen in a vacuum. There has to be stability. And in turn, they have responded that the disputes in the South Sea/West Philippine Sea are not the end all and be all of our relationships. And we have had good cooperation with them on so many different fronts, and perhaps one could even argue that this is the only sore point in our relationship.Now, having said that, perhaps, we have tried to work on that particular premise of building up our ties on different aspects where there is no conflict or very little conflict and, in this particular instance, trying to find the way and means by which we can both achieve our respective goals, which in—which I believe are not—or should not be—mutually exclusive, but rather should be inclusive if at the end of the day, we do want to strive for the prosperity of our respective peoples.That, I think, has to be the primordial concern, rather than disputes on a few rocks that are not possible to be inhabited. And I think in due time, no, given the fact that there's so much commerce that traverses this particular—both in the maritime and the air domain, no—, which has achieved its goals of improving the life of its people, will see the soundness of this proposal and perhaps will act more, shall we say, consistently and actively towards achieving that stability for all. That is our hope. Final question comes from Ed Henry of FOX News.", "label": "Dodging"}
{"sentence": "Mr. Obama, in light of President Trump's policies on climate and Russia, have your anxieties been eased? Do you fear a breakdown in European unity regarding Russia? And post-election, will you declare your future political intentions? [SEP] I've always adhered to a policy of non-interference in other countries' politics. Chancellor Merkel has been an exceptional partner, a pillar of stability since my arrival. While we haven't always seen eye-to-eye, her core values, honesty, and dedication to Germany have been steadfast. Her decision to run again rests solely with her and the German people. Regarding Russia, my approach has been consistent: engagement where possible, firmness where necessary. They're a major power, and cooperation is vital, but we must uphold our values of democracy and international law. I hope the incoming administration will strike a similar balance. I'm heartened by President-elect Trump's commitment to NATO. My conversations with President Putin have been clear: we won't tolerate cyberattacks or election interference. We need global norms to prevent a cyber arms race. The peaceful transition of power in the US is a testament to our democracy. We'll continue our strong cooperation with Germany, and I'll approach President-elect Trump with an open mind. From a European standpoint, respecting territorial integrity is paramount for peace. We must resist any attempts to undermine it and pursue political solutions like the Normandy process. Russia is our neighbor, and we seek a positive relationship, but we must address our differences.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with the economy still struggling despite massive spending, how will Americans know if your programs are actually working? Should they focus on the stock market, foreclosure rates, unemployment figures, or something else? What's the key metric, and when can we expect to see tangible results, or will we need a Plan B? [SEP] The primary measure of success is, without a doubt, job creation. If we can create or save 4 million jobs, that's the first and most important thing. Because when people are working, they have confidence to spend and invest. Businesses see that, and they start investing and hiring as well. So, step one: jobs. Step two: are the credit markets functioning effectively? I talk to so many successful businesses that simply can't get credit. For example, in Elkhart, Indiana, the RV capital, people want to buy RVs but can't get loans, even with good credit. And businesses can't get loans to pay their suppliers. So, normalizing credit is step two. Step three is housing: have we stabilized the market? The Federal Government doesn't control everything, but our plan, working with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, aims to slow foreclosures and stabilize housing values. The biggest indicator is whether we stop losing jobs and start growing again. I don't have a crystal ball, and this is an unprecedented situation. But I'm hoping that after a tough year, businesses will start investing, and consumers will feel secure enough to spend. If we get it right, we should see real improvement next year.

But I've said before that this was an important conversation, even though the disclosures damaged the US and our intelligence capabilities. There was a way to have this debate without that damage. The US respects the rule of law, privacy, and civil liberties. Snowden's actions have allowed countries that actually engage in surveillance and target dissidents to criticize us.

{"sentence": "Q. [Inaudible] My question is for President Bush, is whether you agree that in recent years, the U.S. really had its back turned to Latin America? And if so, what could be done to make up for the losses in the past, in the last 2 years of your Presidency? And to ask President Lula, as well, yesterday you criticized U.S. subsidies as nefarious. So if you really decided to put the two ministers in a room to have an agreement, did you receive any signals that it's possible to reduce domestic subsidies in the U.S. to their farmers? [SEP] Well, I strongly disagree with your description of U.S. foreign policy. That may be what people say, but it's certainly not what the facts bear out. I just told you that our bilateral aid package has doubled.Again, I fully recognize that money alone is not a sign of compassion or care, but it's money aimed at helping people improve their lives. It's social justice money. Most of the bilateral aid money that we spend goes to education programs, health programs.I'm going to—when I go to Guatemala, I'm going to go to a—I'm going to go outside the capital and see our military building health clinics. The USS is coming to the region to provide care for thousands of people who need health care. We train teachers; we train doctors; we train nurses. And so the characterization that our back has been turned is just— it's not borne out by the facts. It may be a perception, but the facts certainly dispel that.And that's why I've come. I've been in your great country twice in a very quick period of time, all aiming at sending the message that we care about our neighborhood a lot. And relations between our Governments are strong; we have an open relationship; the dialog is friendly. There's not 100-percent agreement on issues, but, nevertheless, issues are brought to the table in a constructive manner. And it's amazing what you can do when it comes to solving problems, if there's a feeling of mutual respect and a priority.It's easy to kind of dismiss the United States foreign policy in the region, but think about this: There are millions of people living in our country from the region. The United States is a multicultural society. We've got people from all over South and Central America living in the United States—many there legally, many there illegally, which, by the way, argues for a comprehensive immigration reform plan that teaches people with respect and dignity. It's one of the big issues that I put forth to our Congress, to get a comprehensive immigration plan done.I appreciate your question, and I'm glad to be down here to be able to answer it. In terms of the question from the U.S. journalist, he asked whether I was capable of convincing President Bush to get the tariffs reduced. If I were able to—if I had that capacity for persuasion that you think I might have, who knows, I might have convinced President Bush to do so many other things that I couldn't even mention here. []This is a process. There's no difference between—in negotiating processes like this and normal negotiations between human beings. There's a time you look a person in the face and say, I don't like that guy. And a few months later, they might be your best friend, and you were wrong when you said that you didn't like them. So I don't think that a country will give up on the things that protect their trade because someone else is asking. It's a process of convincing that has to take place, a lot of talking. And the day will come when that conversation will mature, and then we can find a common denominator that will allow us to come to an agreement.In terms of the journalist from the O Globlo newspaper, your question, today we have a problem of what's at stake. I learned from my Minister Celso Amorim that if we draw a triangle, we could show you what the difficulties are in the negotiations we have. What do countries want from the European Union? They want it to facilitate access to their agricultural market for poorer countries to export to them, including the U.S. wants to export to them.What do we want from the U.S.? We want them to reduce subsidies that they pay in their domestic market. And what does the U.S. and the European Union— what do they want from us Brazilians and other countries in the G-20? That we have greater flexibility and access to markets for industrial products and services. That's what's at stake; that's what's in the game.If we are intelligent enough and competent enough to pull out of our vest pockets the numbers that are still held secret, as top state secrets, then we will find a common ground. Don't ask me what the number is. If I knew, I wouldn't tell you, because if I knew, then I'd establish a paradigm, and he'd say that I should back off a little bit. So that's why these numbers are held back, though—as a soccer player, when they're going to kick a penalty goal, they never say which corner they're going to try to kick into. But things are happening. They're underway. Of course there's pessimists about everything in the world. That's no problem.And the third thing I would like to say to President Bush, if you'd allow me to say one thing: Over time, I have become more and more convinced—and I've said this to my colleagues in CARICOM and Central America, I've said this to countries in Africa—that we actually do not need to be discussing aid to those countries. What we need to discuss is something that's even more important than aid. We need to build projects together, projects that mean development, and that after some time, we can see the concrete results of the money that's been invested. Because in some countries over the years, aid money doesn't always lead to concrete results because you don't control how it's spent that well.I'm convinced that in the biofuel programs, if we are mature enough and have the political understanding and can carry out joint projects with other countries with the U.S., involving South Africa, China, India, European countries, and if we fund projects to produce biodiesel and ethanol in poorer countries, and then the richer countries buy biodiesel that's produced there, then we'll see that investments put into those countries have produced results and, even more important, generated jobs. Because nothing gives more citizenry to a man or a women than to know that they have a job, and to take some money home at the end of the month.I think that's what we could do. And I said to President Bush: We could do that for Central America. We could build development projects for poorer countries. Then after 5, 10 years, we'll be able to see that something was done there that's generating wealth. That, in my opinion, is the real way, the major way that richer countries can aid poorer countries.", "label": "Explicit"}

And did what he tell you—should that put this debate to rest?

He said, Who am I to judge?This is a man who is of great empathy. He is a man who understands that part of his Christianity is to reach out and to forgive. And so I just find my relationship with him one that I personally take great solace in. He is a really, truly genuine, decent man.And I'll end by saying that, you know, there were an awful lot of people who—and many of you—I'm not putting you in this position; I apologize—but many of you who are even in the press who went out of your way to express your empathy and sympathy when I lost the real part of my soul, when I—when my—when I lost my Beau, my son.And I—my family will never forget—my extended family. Because when I had come—it was only a matter of days since my son had passed away, and came to the United States to visit with the—with not only President Obama, but with the Catholic Church here. And I was asked if I would accompany him to Philadelphia, to the seminary, and—anyway.And I did, but it was—the wounds were still raw of the loss of my son. And I had my extended family—and you're all tired of seeing my extended family; they're always around—my grandchildren, my children, my wife, my daughters-in-law.And before he left and got on the plane, the Pope asked whether or not he could meet with my family. And we met in a hangar in—at the Philadelphia Airport. And he came in, and he talked to my family for a considerable amount of time—10, 15 minutes—about my son Beau.And he didn't just generically talk about him; he knew about him. He knew what he did. He knew who he was. He knew where he went to school. He knew what he knew what a man he was. And it had such a cathartic impact on his children and my wife and our family that it—it meant a great deal.And as—I meant what I said—everybody was laughing; I didn't realize you all were able to film what I was doing with the Pope when I gave him a command coin. And I meant what I said: I—this is a man who is someone who is looking to establish peace and decency and honor, not just in the Catholic Church, but just generically.When I won, he called me to tell me how much he appreciated the fact that I would focus on the poor and focus on the needs of people who were in trouble. And so I just—again, I don't want to talk more about it, because so much of it is personal, but I'm—he is everything I learned about Catholicism from the time I was a kid going from grade school through high school.And I have great respect for people who have other religious views, but he is—he's just a fine, decent, honorable man.

But here's the thing: elections matter. Voting matters. Getting off your duff and doing something matters. And I always tell the young folks, here and abroad, don't take our way of life for granted. We've had it pretty good for a while now, but that doesn't mean it's always going to be this way. Democracy is a grind. If almost half the voters don't even show up, that's a problem. If we can't tell the difference between what's true and what's not, especially with all the social media nonsense, then we're in trouble. And if people can't compromise and work together, if they're just taking extreme positions and demonizing their opponents, then the whole system breaks down. So, my biggest piece of advice is to understand what makes a democracy tick, and to be a citizen all the time, not just when you're upset or when it's election season. It's hard work. But the good news is, there are a lot of young people out there who are ready to step up and do that work. But sometimes, I think we get a little too comfortable. Here in Europe, a lot of young people have forgotten what the Cold War was all about, what it was like to have a wall dividing the continent. And I've heard some folks over here making comparisons between the U.S. and Russia, like there's no difference between our governments. We're not perfect, we've made mistakes, but we've always tried to uphold certain values, like free speech and civil liberties. And that's something worth remembering. Because in this age of misinformation, where everything looks the same on Facebook, it's easy to lose sight of what's important. We need to know what to protect, what to fight for.

This was analyzed by Gregg Jarrett. It was analyzed by Mark Levin. It was analyzed by everybody. They said this statement that I made—the whole call that I made with the President of Ukraine was a perfect one.So that this country gets put through that, that we have to waste this gentleman's time by even thinking about it, talking about it—I'd much rather focus on peace in the Middle East.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, it seems pretty clear where this Iraq vote in the House is headed. Your Press Secretary has said repeatedly that Members of Congress ought to watch what they say and be concerned about the message that they're sending to our enemy. I'm wondering, do you believe that a vote of disapproval of your policy emboldens the enemy? Does it undermine your ability to carry out your policies there? And also, what are you doing to persuade the Democratic leadership in Congress not to restrict your ability to spend money in Iraq? [SEP] Yes, thanks. A couple of points: One, that I understand the Congress is going to express their opinion, and it's very clear where the Democrats are, and some Republicans; I know that. They didn't like the decision I made. And by the way, that doesn't mean that I think that they're not good, honorable citizens of the country—just have a different opinion. I considered some of their opinions and felt like it would not lead to a country that could govern itself, sustain itself, and be an ally in the war on terror—one.Secondly, my hope, however, is that this nonbinding resolution doesn't try to turn into a binding policy that prevents our troops from doing that which I have asked them to do. That's why I keep reminding people, on the one hand, you vote for David Petraeus in a unanimous way, and then the other hand, you say that you're not going to fund the strategy that he thought was necessary to do his job, a strategy he testified to in front of the Senate. I'm going to make it very clear to the Members of Congress, starting now, that they need to fund our troops, and they need to make sure we have the flexibility necessary to get the job done.Secondly, I find it interesting that there is a declaration about a plan that they have not given a chance to work.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, to be perfectly clear, are you actively exploring options to remove him, the President, as part of this political transition? [SEP] I take Mitch McConnell at his word when he says that the Government is not going to shut down. There is no reason for it to shut down. We traveled down that path before. It was bad for the country, it was bad for every elected official in Washington. And at the end of the day, it was resolved in the same way that it would have been resolved if we hadn't shut the Government down. So that's not going to be productive, and I think that Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner understand that. But this goes to a broader point that I've made previously and I'll just reiterate: It is in the nature of democracy that the parties are going to disagree on certain issues. And in our system, because we don't have a parliamentary system, it means that you can have a Congress of one party and a President of another, and they disagree on some really fundamental issues. And the question then is, how do you deal with that? Well, the sensible way to deal with it is to say here are the issues we don't agree on, and we'll fight like heck for our position, and then, we'll work together on the issues that we do agree on. And that's how it's always been; that's how it was with Ronald Reagan when he was dealing with a Democratic Congress. There was no—at no point did the Democrats say, well, because we don't agree with Ronald Reagan on XYZ issue, then we can't work with him on Social Security reform or tax reform or other issues. He said, okay, we'll fight on that, we'll join together on that, and as a consequence, the country will make progress. And I would expect that same attitude in this instance. I understand that there are members of the Republican Party who deeply disagree with me and law enforcement and the evangelical community and a number of their own Republican colleagues about the need for immigration reform. I get that. And they've made their views clear, and there's nothing wrong with them arguing their position and opposing legislation. But why they would then decide we're going to shut down the Government makes about as much sense as my decision to shut down the Government if they decide to take a vote to repeal health care reform for the—is it 53d or 55th time?

{"sentence": "President Obama, given the apparent stalling of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress, and the fact that other nations are waiting on the U.S., are you considering a shift in strategy to secure its approval, particularly in light of the Boeing and GE deals announced during your Vietnam trip? Furthermore, should the agreement be amended to tackle currency manipulation? And could you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur, as well as Pakistan's concerns about the strike occurring on their soil? Does this indicate a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you worried about a more extremist leader taking his place? [SEP] Well, on TPP, let me just say that I've been around long enough to know that every trade deal is a tough sell. Everyone's looking for a better deal, especially when multiple parties are involved. It's going to be scrutinized, debated, and in an election year, some folks will try to score political points. That being said, I remain confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do for America and the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for us. Most countries here already sell to the U.S. with low tariffs, while our goods face higher tariffs there. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in those markets – a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for opening our markets to countries with lower wages and lax labor and environmental standards. TPP addresses this by including enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and protect the environment. As for currency manipulation, we have provisions for transparency and monitoring. Some argue for enforceable provisions to impose tariffs if currency is devalued, but it's hard to determine the cause of currency devaluation. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. However, we've strengthened provisions to address competitive devaluations. Finally, regarding Mullah Mansur, his death is confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This isn't a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself. However, when a high-profile leader consistently plans to harm U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, I have a responsibility to protect our people. That's the message we're sending.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

How do you respond to concerns that this decision emboldens individuals to disclose classified information, potentially jeopardizing American lives and interests, particularly given WikiLeaks' past actions and Assange's current offer to face charges in the US? [SEP] The idea that Manning's commutation sends a message that leaking secrets is consequence-free is simply false. She served a significant prison term. My decision reflects a belief that her original sentence was excessive, not an endorsement of leaking. We must protect national security, but we also need to consider proportionality and individual circumstances. As for WikiLeaks and Assange, let's be clear: I haven't commented on WikiLeaks. The intelligence community's assessment of Russian hacking didn't definitively link WikiLeaks to the DNC email leak. I don't follow Assange's social media.

The problem is what to do with these dangerous people, people who have engaged in terrorism. We need to give them lawyers, but we can't just release them.

{"sentence": "Mr. President Bush, given Prime Minister Howard's focus on climate change at this APEC meeting, hasn't your decision to hold a separate meeting in Washington undermined his initiative? And what are your views on the significance of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing climate change? [SEP] Let's address Kyoto first. Could you remind me of the first part of your question? I'm getting a bit forgetful in my old age. Kyoto may be suitable for some countries, but it wasn't the right solution for the United States. I was transparent about that. And before I even arrived in Washington, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected it with a 95-0 vote. So, it wasn't just my opinion. We adopted a different strategy, focusing on energy efficiency and innovative technologies. And the outcome? We reduced greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously growing our economy. Not many countries can claim that. We also aspire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. That might concern some exporters, but we have a plan to decrease gasoline consumption by 20% within the next decade, utilizing ethanol and other advanced technologies. Battery technology is also rapidly improving. The critical question is how to expedite the deployment of these technologies. Kyoto didn't accomplish that for us. If you analyze which countries are actually meeting the Kyoto targets, you might conclude that our approach is more effective. We rejected it because we wanted to promote economic growth, achieve energy independence, and protect the environment. John and I agree on the importance of addressing climate change. I also stressed to the G-8 that we need universal participation, including China and India. If they feel coerced, they'll withdraw, and we can't resolve this issue without them. The Prime Minister is astute to reduce tariffs on clean coal technology for China. We fully support that. The essential questions are: How quickly can we deploy these technologies, and can we assist developing nations in acquiring them? Otherwise, our efforts will be in vain. I believe our strategy is the most effective way to address this issue seriously. And I commend John for prioritizing this issue and advocating for energy efficiency.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, has your conversation with the American President eased your concerns regarding his successor's policies on climate change and Russia? Are you worried that the unified European stance on Russia might crumble? And following Mr. Trump's election, wouldn't you need to announce your candidacy again as a gesture of respect? [SEP] Well, I try not to interfere in other people's politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. She's perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived. We're now the veterans of many challenges. Although we haven't always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that good leadership requires engaging the world and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding. So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately, it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds. If I were here and I were German and I had a vote, I might support her. With respect to Russia, my principal approach has been constant since I first came into office. Russia is an important country. It is a military superpower. It has influence in the region and around the world. In order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation. I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing and they are having good relationships with their neighbors and participating constructively on big issues like climate change. So I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but I have also been realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world. The values that we talked about—the values of democracy and free speech and international norms and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity—those things are not something that we can set aside. And so in—on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we've had very significant differences. And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms. And I don't expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria—that we just do whatever is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we'll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together. I am encouraged by the President-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change. And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security, I think, is very important. And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election. As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyber attacks. This isn't new. It's not unique to Russia. There are a number of states where we've seen low-level cyber attacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds. And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, although we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering will sometimes take place even if we don't like it, there's a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we're monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening. I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don't see a cyber arms race. A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn't become a lawless, low-level battlefield. And we've started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G-20, the G-7, and at the U.N. levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front. Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I'm very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it is—it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly. Because this is all about the American people, it's about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming administration. And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. And that is in our mutual interest. So we will continue this. I will continue this with—I approach this with an open mind, and I'll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. Secondly, on Russia, I can only repeat what the President said previously. This is all about respecting certain principles. And I'm saying this from a European vantage point, from a European—from a German vantage point, sorry. The fact that for over 70 years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts. But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts. This is why we launched the Normandy process, in close coordination with the United States of America. And particularly from a German perspective—from the European perspective—I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor. And just look at Poland—the sort of European perspective this has. So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one. We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share. But this mustn't keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements. And this is what I'm going to continue to work on with all my heart. So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today.", "label": "General"}

As a candidate, in Foreign Affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2 the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan? [SEP] The answer is that it's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it's hard to get those troops out. So what we've been doing—what I've been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing—has been—we've been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have—NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we're going to do so in a safe and orderly way.We're in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there.And General Austin is—just met with Kayani [Ghani]* and I'm waiting for the briefing on that. He is the leader, quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there's a U.N.-led process that's beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people—how to end this war.But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time.

And they need our help, and that's where our focus is.But remember, when you're talking about bases and troops, we're dealing with a sovereign government. Now, we entered into an agreement with the Karzai Government. They weren't called permanent bases, but they were called arrangements that will help this Government understand that there will be a U.S. presence so long as they want them there. And at the appropriate time, I'm confident we'll be willing to sit down and discuss the long-term security of Iraq. But right now we're discussing how to bring security to Baghdad and what do we do in Al Anbar Province, where Al Qaida still uses violent methods to achieve political objectives.You know, it's interesting, if you—I'm sure people who watch your TV screens think the entire country is embroiled in sectarian conflict and that there's constant killing everywhere in Iraq. Well, if you listened to General Casey yesterday, 90 percent of the action takes place in 5 of the 18 Provinces. And around Baghdad, it's within a 30-mile area. And the reason I bring that up is that while it seems to our American citizens that nothing normal is taking place—and I can understand why; it's a brutal environment there, particularly that which is on our TV screens—that there is farmers farming; there are small businesses growing; there's a currency that's relatively stable; there's an entrepreneurial class; there's commerce. General Abizaid was describing to me what it was like to go to Baghdad markets.There's a lot of work to be done, don't get me wrong, but it is—there are people living relatively normal lives who, I believe—strongly believe that they want to continue that normalcy.

{"sentence": "President Bush, considering the historical challenges in achieving migration reform, why should Mexicans, or anyone, believe that a breakthrough is now possible? And President Calderon, what were the key topics discussed during your lunch with President Fox? [SEP] Well, first off, let me say that legislative progress in the U.S. can be a bit of a marathon, not a sprint. I'm not sure how it works in Mexico, Mr. President, but here, debates can take time before a consensus emerges. We haven't had a truly serious national conversation about migration until recently. There was a law in '86, but the real debate didn't start until after 2000, if I recall correctly. As a former Governor of Texas, I've always understood the importance of this issue and have worked to elevate it over the years. Congress has taken it seriously, but crafting legislation on such a complex topic is tough. Many Americans were concerned about the lack of enforcement of our existing laws. Over the past year, we've demonstrated a strong commitment to the rule of law, which I believe has made Congress more receptive to the idea that comprehensive migration reform can actually enhance border security. By making it less necessary for people to cross illegally, we can free up resources to focus on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns moving in both directions. I'm optimistic about our chances. While I don't like to make predictions, the mood in Congress seems to have shifted from skepticism to a recognition that comprehensive reform is in the nation's best interest. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are working together, and my administration is actively involved in helping them find common ground. I recently met with former President Vicente Fox, whom I admire, and we had a constructive conversation. He congratulated us on our first 100 days and expressed his willingness to cooperate with my government for the benefit of Mexicans.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. The President-elect has said that he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia if they substantially reduced their nuclear stockpile. Given your own efforts at arms control, do you think that's an effective strategy? Knowing this office and Mr. Trump, how would you advise his advisers to help him be effective when he deals with Vladimir Putin? And given your actions recently on Russia, do you think those sanctions should be viewed as leverage? [SEP] Well, a couple of things. Number one, I think it is in America's interests and the world's interests that we have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my Presidency. Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community and tried to work with the President and the Government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways.I think it's fair to say that after President Putin came back into the Presidency that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seemed to be premised on the idea that whatever America is trying to do must be bad for Russia and so we want to try and counteract whatever they do, that return to an adversarial spirit that, I think, existed during the cold war has made the relationship more difficult. And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine.The reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues. It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon, by force, by Russia. That wasn't our judgment, that was the judgment of the entire international community. And Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international law and international norms.What I've said to the Russians is, as soon as you stop doing that, the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve not only American interests, but also the interests of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don't confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.On nuclear issues, in my first term, we negotiated the START II Treaty, and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stockpiles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further. I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there is—remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce our stockpiles. And part of the reason we've been successful on our nonproliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda is because we were leading by example.I hope that continues. But I think it's important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big countries don't go around and invade and bully smaller countries. I've said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are, historically, bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. But Ukraine is an independent country.And this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around the world in preserving basic norms and values, whether it's advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women's rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press.The United States has not always been perfect in this regard. There are times where we, by necessity, are dealing with allies or friends or partners who, themselves, are not meeting the standards that we would like to see met when it comes to international rules and norms. But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting—in the United Nations, in the G-20, in the G-7—the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues. And it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues, because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.Kevin Corke [Fox News].", "label": "Dodging"}

The best way to make sure we get a lasting cease-fire is to work with Egypt to stop weapons from being smuggled into Gaza, which is what lets Hamas keep firing rockets. Countries that are giving weapons to Hamas need to stop. The international community needs to keep the pressure on them. If Hamas wants a lasting cease-fire, they need to stop arming themselves.

And the best way to solve it diplomatically is for the United States to work with other nations to send a focused message, and that is, that you will be isolated and you will have economic hardship if you continue trying to enrich.As you might remember, I worked closely with Vladimir Putin on this issue. When I said that—when asked at one of these innumerable press conferences, Did you— do you think they ought to have a civilian nuclear program? I said, Of course, they should, but they can't be trusted to enrich.And therefore, I agree with Russia that Russia—when Russia said she will provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power program and will collect the enriched uranium, thereby negating the need for the ian regime to enrich at all.And so we will continue working diplomatically.Listen, thank you very much.

And are you concerned at all that the Koran burning and the episodes that have followed since then threaten your ability to negotiate with partners? [SEP] Well, keep in mind that the transition policy was in place and established at Lisbon, and we've been following that strategy that calls for us turning over increasing responsibility to Afghans and a full transition so that our combat role is over by the end of 2014. And our coalition partners have agreed to it. They are sticking with it. That continues to be the plan.What we are now going to be doing over the next--at this NATO meeting and planning for the next 2 years is to make sure that that transition is not a cliff, but that there are benchmarks and steps that are taken along the way, in the same way that we reduced our role in Iraq, so that it is gradual, Afghan capacity is built, the partnering with Afghan security forces is effective, that we are putting in place the kinds of support structures that are needed in order for the overall strategy to be effective.Now, yes, the situation with the Koran burning concerns me. I think that it is an indication of the challenges in that environment, and it's an indication that now is the time for us to transition.Obviously, the violence directed at our people is unacceptable. And President Karzai acknowledged that. But what is also true is President Karzai, I think, is eager for more responsibility on the Afghan side. We're going to be able to find a mechanism whereby Afghans understand their sovereignty is being respected and that they're going to be taking a greater and greater role in their own security.

Probably in various regions, equal opportunities were not fully ensured for women. And we have actually a quite short history of ensuring that. So what we're trying to do is to very actively ensure such opportunities for women.", "label": "Dodging"}

And, did you bring this up with the Prime Minister earlier today? Prime Minister, it's been suggested that your alliance with Mr. Al Sadr is a major obstacle in Iraq. Did you promise the President you'd cut ties with Al Sadr, and could your government survive such a move? [SEP] I'll let the Prime Minister address his relationship with Al Sadr directly. We spent considerable time discussing the security situation in Iraq. I voiced my concerns, and he shared his own – after all, ensuring the safety of the Iraqi people is his top priority. The Prime Minister is frustrated by the lack of resources to deal with those who break the law. I was encouraged by his commitment to a pluralistic, politically unified society where people are held accountable for their actions, be they criminals, Al Qaeda, or militia members. He discussed his political situation with me, and I think he's the best person to speak about the Sadr group or any other group within Iraq. Our coalition isn't limited to one entity. The national unity government is made up of all participating entities, representing a shared national responsibility. Mr. Sadr and the Sadrists are just one part of the Parliament and Government. Participation in the Government is a responsibility, a mutual commitment, and those involved must uphold the Government, the Constitution, and the law. I'm focused on the state, the law, and the commitments that apply to all partners in the Government. We'll deal with lawbreakers equally, because the most important principle is the sovereignty and power of the state.", "label": "General"}

Their connection to India is substantial, as is mine. Prime Minister Modi is a friend, and he's doing a commendable job under difficult circumstances. On a related note, the situation on the border between China and India is rather tense. We're prepared to offer assistance if needed and are in dialogue with both countries.

[SEP] Look, I think China has a difficult economic problem right now for a whole range of reasons that relate to the international growth and lack thereof and the policies that China has followed.And so I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite: It probably doesn't have the same capacity that it had before.But as I said, I'm notwe're not looking to hurt China, sincerely.

However, we've since witnessed a significant build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, cyber attacks, and demands for a sphere of influence that would require the withdrawal of American forces from the former Soviet bloc. Do you still hold the same view of President Putin's intentions, and if not, how would you respond to a potential invasion? [SEP] Well, let me put it this way. I still believe a full-blown war isn't what he's after, but make no mistake, he'll test the resolve of the West, especially the US and NATO. However, he'll face consequences he hasn't fully considered. As for his motivations, he's grappling with what he sees as the tragedy of Russia – the fall of the Berlin Wall, the loss of empire. He's got vast resources, but he's trying to find his place between China and the West. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure he knows what he'll do. My hunch is he'll make a move. He feels he has to. He wants guarantees: no NATO membership for Ukraine and no strategic weapons stationed there. We might find common ground on the latter, depending on his actions. As for the former, international treaties suggest Ukraine has the right to choose its alliances, but NATO membership isn't likely in the near future anyway.

Or are you leaving some room for negotiation there? [SEP] I'll always leave room for negotiation. But this has been many years; this isn't just Trump administration. We're new. This has been many years, even decades. We have immigration laws. We have border security. We have all sorts of things going on that are—it's disgraceful. We are doing a phenomenal job. We're setting records. But we have laws that don't work. So we're working around those laws, and it's unfortunate.I have to take my hat off to the Border Patrols, for the law enforcement, to ICE, which really has been maligned by the Democrats. The job they do, they go into these MS-13 nests, nests of bad, bad people, killers, in many cases. And they go in there fearless, and they do an incredible job. And they get them out. They either go to jail, or they get out of the country. So I want to just take my hat off to ICE and the brave people that have really been maligned by the Democrats.We need border security. Without a border, as this gentleman can tell you also—because the Prime Minister really was—it was a very big factor in his win and other people's win in Italy—but it was a big factor in my win. We need border security. Border security includes the wall, but it includes many other things. We have to end the lottery. We have to end the chain. The chain is like a disaster. You bring one person in, and you end up with 32 people. We have to end these horrible catch-and-relief—release principles, where you catch somebody, you take their name, and you release them. You don't even know who they are. And then, they're supposed to come back to a court case, where they want us to hire thousands of judges. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we have to change our laws, and we do that through Congress.So I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.

They're less susceptible to sensationalized narratives. Historically, many presidents have seen similar polling numbers at this stage of their presidencies. The public is actively engaged in separating fact from fiction. Their choice of news sources significantly influences their beliefs. Cable news is experiencing a decline in viewership.

And if not sanctioned, do you believe someone within your administration is actively working against your Iraq strategy or attempting to derail your meeting with the Prime Minister? [SEP] I'm trying to recall if I specifically ordered an investigation. The details are a bit hazy. What I do recall is expressing my strong disapproval of the constant flow of leaks. The press is always digging for information, and that's their job, but I can't condone the leaking of classified material. It's a persistent problem, not unique to this administration, but one that any administration faces when trying to enact policy. We've had many leaks, some from sources I can't even identify, so I won't engage in speculation. Finding the leaker is notoriously difficult, which is an advantage you have in your line of work. We can complain about it, but it's tough to pinpoint those within the government who are willing to leak sensitive documents, like Hadley's. There could be an investigation underway; I honestly don't know for sure. If there is, and I was briefed, it's not something I'm actively thinking about. But I do believe that it's important to find and hold accountable anyone within our government who is leaking classified information, which is against the law.

Could you clarify who is ultimately responsible for this decision? Are you actively pursuing the closure, and do you anticipate its completion before the end of your term? [SEP] The closure of Guantanamo, while a stated objective, presents considerable logistical and diplomatic challenges. A primary obstacle is securing the cooperation of other nations in accepting the repatriation of detainees. The recent Senate vote, reflecting widespread reluctance to house these individuals domestically, underscores the complexity of this issue. To suggest that no progress has been made is inaccurate. We are actively engaged in negotiations with foreign governments to facilitate repatriation, while also ensuring humane treatment upon their return. Furthermore, the establishment of fair and transparent trial procedures is paramount. We are collaborating with the judiciary and the Department of Defense to expedite these proceedings.

[SEP] I must tread carefully here, as Mr. Snowden faces indictment and criminal charges. This matter falls under the purview of the Attorney General, a judge, and a jury. Therefore, I cannot offer specific commentary on the case at this juncture. However, I will attempt to address the underlying spirit of the question. I have previously stated that this is a necessary conversation. I have also stated that the manner of these disclosures has harmed the United States and our intelligence capabilities. There was a way to have this debate without causing such damage. For example, the United States, despite its imperfections, adheres to the rule of law, values privacy and civil liberties, and respects our Constitution. As a result of these disclosures, countries that explicitly engage in the very actions Mr. Snowden claims to be concerned about—surveillance of their own citizens, targeting political dissidents, suppressing the press—are able to criticize the United States for its surveillance and intelligence operations. This is a distorted view. While this debate is important and necessary, it is crucial to remember that it has caused unnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and diplomacy.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, I'd like your perspective on the proposed construction of a mosque near Ground Zero. While the organizers have a constitutional right to build, what message would it send if they were dissuaded from doing so? Also, has the Florida minister's threat to burn Korans endangered American lives? [SEP] On your second point, it's undeniable that deliberately provoking the passions of over a billion Muslims worldwide, especially when our troops are stationed in many Muslim countries, creates a problem. It complicates the already challenging task of our men and women in uniform. Regarding the mosque in New York, I've stated my position clearly: this nation upholds the principle that all individuals are created equal and possess inalienable rights, including the freedom of religious practice. If a church, synagogue, or Hindu temple can be built on a site, so should a mosque. I acknowledge the extreme sensitivities surrounding 9/11. I've met with families of 9/11 victims and understand their enduring pain and loss. But we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with terrorist organizations that distort Islam or misuse its name for destructive purposes. We must be clear about this, because to effectively combat terrorism, we need allies. Al Qaeda seeks a war between the West and Islam. Fortunately, most Muslims are peace-loving and share our aspirations: good jobs, education for their children, safety, and improved lives. They reject violent ideology. From a national security standpoint, we must identify the true enemy: a small minority engaged in horrific acts, primarily targeting Muslims. We also have millions of Muslim Americans, our fellow citizens, who are our neighbors, friends, and coworkers. When we suggest their religion is offensive, what message do we send them? Muslims serve in our armed forces in Afghanistan, risking their lives for us. We must affirm that they are Americans and honor their service, ensuring they understand we don't differentiate between them and us. That's a vital principle to uphold.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, thank you. The communique states in no uncertain terms that all of the unprecedented cooperation for which you're calling will be done on a voluntary basis, not a binding commitment. What's the likelihood that countries which have been at odds over these issues for a number of years are now going to cooperate? How can this be enforced? [SEP] Well, let's just take a specific example, Bill. For about 10 years, we had been encouraging Ukraine to either ship out its highly enriched uranium or transform it to a lower grade--a lower enriched uranium. And in part because of this conference, Ukraine took that step, announced that it would complete this step over the next couple of years.So all the commitments that we talked about are ones that we've already booked, even before the communique and the work plan gets put into place. And that indicates the degree to which I think that there's actually strong unanimity about the importance of this issue as a threat to the global and international community.Now, keep in mind that we also have a number of international conventions that have been put in place. Not all of them have been ratified. In fact, the United States needs to work on a couple of these conventions dealing with the issues of nuclear terrorism and trafficking.

[SEP] The answer to your initial inquiry is no. When communicating with our allies and partners, including India, the idea that I would self-censor or avoid expressing my honest assessment of the situation with China is simply not something I'm prepared to do. I maintain that the alarm surrounding our relationship with China is largely exaggerated. We encountered an incident that generated some uncertainty, to put it mildly.

Regarding Kyoto, it simply wasn't the right fit for the United States. The Senate made that abundantly clear. We're taking a different approach, one focused on energy efficiency and new technologies. And we've actually reduced greenhouse gases while growing our economy. Now, as for John's efforts, I fully support addressing climate change, but it requires a global solution. We need to involve everyone, including countries like China and India. We can't just impose solutions; we need collaboration. And John's idea of reducing tariffs on clean technologies is a smart one.

And as you mentioned, October was the deadliest month for American forces this year—in a year. Do you think we're winning, and why? [SEP] First of all, this is a different kind of war than a war against the fascists in World War II. We were facing a nation-state—two nation-states—three nation-states in World War II. We were able to find an enemy by locating its ships or aircraft or soldiers on the ground. This is a war against extremists and radicals who kill innocent people to achieve political objectives. It has a multiple of fronts.Afghanistan was a front in this war against the terrorists. Iraq is now the central front in the war against the terrorists. This war is more than just finding people and bringing them to justice. This war is an ideological conflict between a radical ideology that can't stand freedom and moderate, reasonable people that hope to live in a peaceful society.And so it's going to take a long time, Terry. I am confident we will succeed. I am confident we'll succeed in Iraq, and the reason I'm confident we'll succeed in Iraq is because the Iraqis want to succeed in Iraq. The ultimate victory in Iraq, which is a government that can sustain itself, govern itself, and defend itself, depends upon the Iraqi citizens and the doing the hard work necessary to protect their country. And our job is to help them achieve that objective. As a matter of fact, my view is, the only way we lose in Iraq is if we leave before the job is done.And I'm confident we can succeed in the broader war on terror, this ideological conflict. I'm confident because I believe the power of liberty will defeat the ideology of hate every time, if given a chance. I believe that the radicals represent the few in the Middle East. I believe the majority of people want to live in a peaceful world. That's what I believe.And I know it's incumbent upon our Government and others who enjoy the blessings of liberty to help those moderates succeed, because otherwise, we're looking at the potential of this kind of world: a world in which radical forms of Islam compete for power; a world in which moderate governments get toppled by people willing to murder the innocent; a world in which oil reserves are controlled by radicals in order to extract blackmail from the West; a world in which Iran has a nuclear weapon. And if that were to occur, people would look back at this day and age and say, What happened to those people in 2006? How come they couldn't see the threat to a future generation of people?Defeat will only come if the United States becomes isolationist and refuses to, one, protect ourselves, and two, help those who desire to become—to live in a moderate, peaceful world.

And I'm curious whether you believe that the talks that Pakistan is reportedly brokering between the Taliban and President Karzai of Afghanistan hold promise, or do they concern you? And a related question--not a second question--[Laughter]--is, do you agree with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, David Cameron--David, to you--that the--we can be totally out of Afghanistan by 2015 and turn the lights off? [SEP] I'm not sure that's a quote from David, but I'll take the second question first. We have been in Afghanistan now for 9 years. Next year, we will have been there for a decade. This is now America's longest war. And what that means is that all of us have an interest not in occupying Afghanistan, but an interest in making sure Afghanistan is stable, can stand on its own two feet when it comes to security issues, and is not a base for terrorist activities launched against the United States of America.Now, I think that we're going to need to provide assistance to Afghanistan for a long time to come. They are still building up a national government. They are in a very tough neighborhood. They are a very poor country. So on a whole range of issues--from economic, development, setting up courts, setting up effective police forces, a political system that is transparent and fair, as well as with respect to security--we intend to be a partner with Afghanistan over the long term. But that is different from us having troops on the ground.Now, I've been clear about the policy that we're pursuing. It was announced last November, and we're several months into it. The policy involves us sending in additional troops--we already had approximately 68,000; we put in an additional 30,000--with the intent of providing the Afghan Government the space and the time to build up its security forces, for us to be able to help blunt the momentum of the Taliban, to clear some of the areas in which the Taliban had gotten a very fierce foothold, to start moving Afghan security forces in, even as we are improving governance and we're improving the legitimacy and credibility of the civilian Government.That is the policy that General McChrystal was pursuing. That is the policy that General Petraeus is pursuing. That is the policy that all of our ISAF allies have fully endorsed, as has President Karzai.Now, it's tough. It is a tough challenge, for reasons that have been amply recorded. As I said, this is a--this is the third poorest country in the world. It has an extraordinarily high illiteracy rate. It has suffered through 30 years of war. And so this is going to be tough. But what I expect is that by the end of this year, we will have seen progress on the strategy that was laid out. We will conduct a full review. Those things that are not working, we will fix. Those things that are working, we will build on, both on the civilian side and on the military side, as well as on the diplomatic side. Because ultimately, as is true in--as was true in Iraq, so will be true in Afghanistan: We're going to have to have a political solution, not simply a military solution.Now, with respect to the negotiations and efforts at reintegration, I think it's too early to tell. I think that we have to view these efforts with skepticism, but also openness. The Taliban is a blend of hardcore ideologues, tribal leaders, kids that basically sign up because it's the best job available to them. Not all of them are going to be thinking the same way about the Afghan Government, about the future of Afghanistan. And so we're going to have to sort through how these talks take place. But I think that President Karzai's peace jirga was a useful step. He's going to be having a Kabul conference that I think will be a useful step in this direction.I think that conversations between the Afghan Government and the Pakistani Government, building trust between those two Governments is a useful step. I think to the extent that we can get all the regional players to recognize that it is in everybody's interests that this region between Pakistan and Afghanistan are not used to launch terrorist attacks, that will be a useful step.

We raised things that required more amplification or made sure we didn't have any misunderstandings. And so it was, kind of—after 2 hours, there, we looked at each other like, Okay, what next?What is going to happen next is, we're going to be able to look back—look ahead in 3 to 6 months, and say: Did the things we agreed to sit down and try to work out, did it work?

And will you announce your candidacy after the election? [SEP] Well, I've always believed in respecting the political processes of other nations, so I won't comment directly on their internal affairs. I can say that Chancellor Merkel has been a remarkable partner. She's been a constant presence since I took office, and we've navigated many challenges together. While we haven't always agreed on everything, her commitment to core values, her integrity, and her dedication to the German people have been unwavering. It's her decision whether to run again, and ultimately, the German people will decide. As for Russia, my approach has always been consistent. They are a significant global player, and cooperation is essential for addressing many global challenges. However, we must also be realistic about our differences, particularly regarding democracy, human rights, and international law. I hope the incoming administration will find areas for cooperation while also standing firm on these principles. I'm encouraged by President-elect Trump's commitment to NATO. As for my conversations with President Putin, I've made it clear that we will not tolerate interference in our elections or cyberattacks on our institutions. We need to establish international norms in cyberspace to prevent a cyber arms race. Finally, I'm impressed by the smooth transition of power in the United States, which reflects our commitment to democratic principles. We will continue to cooperate with Germany, and I will approach my interactions with President-elect Trump with an open mind. From a European perspective, maintaining peace depends on respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all nations. We must stand firm against any attempts to undermine this principle. We hope for political solutions, such as the Normandy process, in coordination with the United States. Russia is our neighbor, and we want a good relationship, but we must also address our differences. I will announce my candidacy at the appropriate time.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

And President Lee, on North Korea, are you confident in their commitment to verifiable denuclearization, given past failures? [SEP] Look, I've been engaging with Chinese leadership for quite some time now, and my message has been consistent: a society flourishes when it embraces freedom of thought and belief. Suppressing these fundamental rights is a mistake, plain and simple. I reiterate this point in every discussion. My attendance at the Olympics is a demonstration of respect for the Chinese people, and to support our athletes. I want our team to bring home the gold, but it's also an opportunity to underscore our values. I've consistently voiced my concerns about religious freedom, long before the Olympics. Now, regarding the six-party talks, skepticism is understandable. North Korea's past behavior warrants caution. However, I commend President Bush's leadership in navigating this complex situation. Denuclearization remains our unwavering objective. We will remain patient, consistent, and committed to achieving verifiable progress.

I've said before that this was a necessary conversation, even though the disclosures damaged the US and our intelligence capabilities. There was a way to have this debate without such damage.

{"sentence": "President Obama, considering the TPP's apparent deadlock in Congress and other nations looking to the U.S. for leadership, are you contemplating a new strategy to secure its approval, especially given the recent Boeing and GE announcements? Should the agreement be amended to address concerns about currency manipulation? Also, your reaction to the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and Pakistan's concerns about the strike on their soil? Does this indicate a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you worried about a more hardline leader emerging? [SEP] Well, on TPP, I’ve been around long enough to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal. And especially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it. Having said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done. And the reason I'm confident is because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good for the world. And I know I've sold this to you before, but let me reiterate: This is the fastest growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market for the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In other words, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest growing markets of the world, that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers. Number two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulations. Well, if you're signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice, to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts, the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries. So I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. And I'm confident we will get it passed. Now, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korean free trade agreement or the Colombian and Panamanian free trade agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although it will—there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way. With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not something that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way. But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them. On the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people.

Also, your thoughts on Mullah Mansur's death, Pakistan's concerns, a new Afghan offensive, and a more extreme Taliban leader? [SEP] Regarding TPP, every trade agreement is a challenge. Everyone seeks a better deal. With multiple parties involved, scrutiny is high. In an election year, some will try to score political points.However, I'm confident we'll succeed because it's the right thing to do. It benefits America, the region, and the world.This is the fastest-growing region. It's a huge market for the U.S. Most countries already sell to us with low tariffs. Conversely, tariffs are higher for U.S. goods sold there. A deal eliminating 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in these markets is good for American businesses and workers.Historically, trade deals have been criticized for exposing our markets to countries with lower wages, poor labor practices, and weak environmental regulations. TPP requires enforceable commitments to raise labor standards, empower workers, and address environmental issues. This allows us to engage with countries like Vietnam and work on these concerns.I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will make us worse off. We'll demonstrably benefit. American workers and businesses will gain if TPP passes. I'm confident it will.The politics will be noisy. This was true for the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements I inherited. But we got them done. I'm confident we'll do it again, despite the challenges.Regarding currency manipulation, TPP includes transparency and reporting mechanisms to monitor it. Some argue for enforceable provisions allowing us to impose tariffs if currency is devalued too much. However, it's difficult to determine if devaluation is manipulation. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. We've strengthened provisions to address competitive devaluations.Finally, Mullah Mansur's death is confirmed. As Taliban leader, he targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, who were there to maintain a counterterrorism platform and train Afghan forces. This doesn't change our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself.However, when a high-profile leader consistently plans to harm U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, I must act to protect our people. That's the message we've sent.President Quang, let me address the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

So I would like to add that Vietnam, together with other TPP countries, have been making efforts to narrow differences, to promote cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual respect. And we will try to reduce differences in the spirit of constructiveness and understanding and paying attention to one another's legitimate interests.

One of the benefits of having a good friendship is that he's not afraid of telling me what's on his mind. [] And he made it abundantly clear that visa policy in America must take into account Romanian past and also Romanian future and present. In other words—and I fully understand the frustrations of the Romanian people. I understand it. I understand that a citizen says: Wait a minute. We're contributing soldiers in Iraq, and yet we're not necessarily treated like other nations in the European collective or European Union.And those frustrations are clearly understandable. That's why I went to Congress and tried to get them to modernize the visa law. And all they—although they changed the law, it still creates certain hurdles for nations like Romania. And I assured the President that we will work with him as best as we can to adhere to our law and to, at the same time, understands the contradictions.It's—hopefully, the new law will—and our cooperation—will make it easier for Romanian citizens to come and visit their relatives. And obviously, to the extent that somebody tries to come and not come back is something we all got to guard about. That's—but the idea of somebody coming to visit a relative or a long-lost cousin to say hello and to see what America is like and then come back to Romania is an issue that we just got to be thoughtful about.And so yes, I mean, this is—this subject came up. It is clear there's a level of frustration. I explained our new law is in effect, and we'll work closely with the Romanian Government to meet our law and, at the same time, meet the demands of a strong and good ally.Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Right, you want to go over here? Just a moment. Oh, you got—— Just a moment. He's not through. The information would like to add to refer to two delicate issues, issues that are visible for the Romanian public. We have also approached— we have also addressed the visa issue and also the Teo Peter issue.

[SEP] You know, I've seen the reports of what they call an emergency declaration. I have seen no such evidence that he's made that decision. In my discussions with President Musharraf, I have reminded him that we share a common enemy, extremists and radicals who would like to do harm to our respective societies. In his case, they would like to kill him, and they've tried.I have made it clear to him that I would expect there to be full cooperation in sharing intelligence, and I believe we've got good intelligence sharing. I have indicated to him that the American people would expect there to be swift action taken if there is actionable intelligence on high-value targets inside his country. Now, I recognize Pakistan is a sovereign nation, and that's important for Americans to recognize that. But it's also important for Americans to understand that he shares the same concern about radicals and extremists as I do and as the American people do.So my focus in terms of the domestic scene there is that he have a free and fair election.

This is my second trip, and I'm here to remind everyone that it's in our interest to help African nations combat diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS, promote trade, and invest in education. Ghana is a great place to highlight these efforts. It's one thing to give speeches in America, it's another to see the progress firsthand. Africa has changed positively since I became president, thanks to African leaders. We've seen conflict resolution, like in Liberia, where we helped install the first democratically elected female president. We're a partner, not an imposer. Democracy is also advancing, thanks to leaders like John Kufuor. Our aid program now demands accountability, like fighting corruption and investing in education.

{"sentence": "Q. Hello. A question from Agence France-Presse on behalf of the French press. As you arrived, Mr. President, you were saying that there was no plan B; that the Iran deal was to be preserved. Now you're talking about a new deal with Iran. Why do you change your mind? Did you join the strong approach suggested by President Trump? Is it because you could not convince him? And in addition, do you think the others who signed the agreement, the deal, will follow you? [SEP] When I said there was no plan B, I usually refer to the fact that there is no B planet. It was about climate rather than Iran. Rather—now, regarding Iran, I've always been coherent, and you can go back to what I said at the U.N. General Assembly in September. I always said that there was the JCPOA, but we needed to add three pillars: post-2025, the ballistic issue, and the regional influence. I do not know what will decide regarding the JCPOA, and it is his responsibility.The JCPOA is the first pillar of this framework I just described. So I'm not saying that we're moving from one deal to another. I'm saying it is one aspect of the problem. I haven't—have never been as critical of the JCPOA as has, because I believe that we can usefully add to it.But no matter the decision that will take, what I would like is to work, as from now, on a new deal with four pillars, including what is already covered by the JCPOA, that is ongoing nuclear—I mean, the current nuclear activities, the longer nuclear activities, the ballistic activities, and the regional influenceSo this is constant. But over the past few weeks and over—and in particular today, we've been able to go and to very much talk in details about this topic, including the situation in the region. And I believe that we've converged on a common reading of what is happening in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq, in particular.And on the fact that the nuclear issue is not the only one, that indeed there is a problem with the ballistical activity of Iran and their presence in a number of countries in the region. And that our willingness was indeed to set the conditions for the stability of the region. Once we've built this convergence of view, the idea of moving on to a new deal that would include the solution for Syria, I believe, is a strong step forward thanks to the discussions we've had today.So I very much would like us to work together with all of our partners. And the Ministers of Foreign Affairs already gathered the small group, and they will be doing it again anytime soon. The purpose is to have some—the allied powers—and we amongst them—and of course, also the regional powers, to work at the level of this small group. We also shall have some privileged discussions with Russia and Turkey on regional topics, including Syria. So as from now, we will work using that method in favor—work towards a deal.I believe we can both combine our common views and our differences, because we are not in a vacuum. I always said we should not tear apart the JCPOA and have nothing else. I think this would be—that would not be the good solution. But once we are placing ourselves in a momentum, the purpose of which is to put together a broad agreement covering the four topics I just mentioned, it's very different because, first of all, we can take on board the concerns and the criticism of regarding this deal, which, like I said, once again, this deal was supported by a former American administration and previous American administration.But we can work, and it is also about respecting the sovereignty of the states of the region. It's not about intervening no matter what. It is rather about building a stable framework that will contribute to stability and to peacebuilding. And I think this is what we've been agreeing upon today. It's not about tearing about an agreement and have nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns. And if I might add, they—states and, as I alluded to—that—and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost.The United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before—and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to—$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, Oh, we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things—tunnels, bridges—they say, Oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period.The countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important—because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that.But there is a chance—and nobody knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea—but we'll see. But we'll see also, if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations. Because this a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal. It's a bad structure. It's falling down. Should have never, ever been made. I blame Congress. I blame a lot of people for it. But it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th.But I will say, if Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid.

{"sentence": "Q. Are you worried about the signal that it would send to Russia by doing this? [SEP] I think it sends a very strong signal to Russia. But I think a stronger signal sent to Russia is the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia, and—through the pipeline. And I'm saying, What's that all about? You're spending billions of dollars to Russia, then we're supposed to defend you from Russia.So I think it's a very bad—I think the people of Germany are very unhappy about it. I have many friends from Germany, and the people in Germany are very unhappy about it. They don't like it, but that's what they chose to do. So they're spending billions of dollars to buy Russian energy, and then we're supposed to defend them from Russia. So that doesn't work too well.But Poland has been very, very terrific. In fact, I don't believe Poland is actually accepting any of the energy from the pipeline from Russia. So that sends a signal right there.With all of that being said, we expect to get along with Russia; we expect to get along with everybody. But Germany has—they really owe a lot of money in NATO, and this has been going on for many years. When you add it all up, you're probably getting close to a trillion dollars. And that's not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn't treating the United States fairly.You know, the United States is a very—is the major participant in NATO. We pay more than anybody else, by far; have for many, many years. So we defend Europe, but Europe also takes tremendous advantage of the United States on trade, advantage like you wouldn't believe. So we're trying to work that out.And I would imagine they'd like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than But after the election, they'll just have to pay more, but that's the way it is. Okay?Thank you very much. Please. Sir, first of all, I do respect very much both Mr. President, Donald Trump, and the United States of America—a wonderful, great state which today is the largest military and economic superpower in the world.And I wouldn't dare say to the President of the United States of America where he should send his soldiers, because this is the decision which is always taken by the United States. This is a very responsible decision.However, I do not deny that I requested Mr. President that he would not withdraw U.S. forces from Europe, because the security of Europe is very important to me, from Europe as such. I'm talking about the united Europe for which the American presence, since the end of the Second World War, is a huge security guarantee.However, if I'm asked by anybody if I am ready that Poland receives more U.S. troops in our country, of course, I am ready. In 2014, Russia attacked Ukraine. It annexed Crimea. It occupies Luhansk and Donetsk. Before that, it had attacked Georgia. 2014 was a year of huge fears—huge fears in the Baltic States and very big ones, very considerable ones among the Polish society.Today, the presence of NATO troops and, first and foremost, of U.S. troops in Poland demonstrates that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is treated seriously. And it shows that if anyone wanted to attack Poland, it won't be a soft landing for that entity; that it won't pay off for such an aggressor, because the strongest army of the world is present and they would help Polish soldiers to defend our borders if such a case arises.One hundred years ago, we repelled Russians from Warsaw. In a great battle in 1920, we defeated the Soviet Army Bolsheviks, and we drove them back to the east. That was a great victory, but we managed to stop them only very near to Warsaw, at the outskirts of our capital city. We would never want to see that situation repeated again. That is why the Allied presence is crucially important to us today and it is a very important security guarantee to us.So I'm very pleased that both within NATO, as well as in the United States, and today, that President of the United States understands the history of Europe and he understands the realities in Europe, and that he also understands the situation as it is developing in Europe.So today, this generates peace to my country; it brings security. And thanks to that, Russian—unfortunately, the very strong imperial ambitions which have been revived over the last tens of years, I can say, because Georgia was attacked in 2008—thanks to this, those ambitions have been stopped for the time being, at least in this part of the world. And I have no doubt whatsoever that this is also a huge merit of the policy of the United States. I'm grateful for that, just like all my compatriots are. Thank you very much. I just want to add: 2014, which the President was talking about, that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us.

[SEP] It sounds pretty clear to me when I say I have—the first recollection is when Mike Hayden briefed me. That's pretty clear. Secondly, I am confident that the preliminary inquiry conducted by the AG and the IG of the CIA, coupled with the oversight provided by the Congress, will end up enabling us all to find out what exactly happened.

They've been there a long time, between him and his predecessor. At some point, I would imagine, things will change. But we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet. We can do the tough sanctions. And all options are open, so we may be doing that. But we haven't done the toughest of sanctions, as you know. We've done, I would say, right down the middle.

There is no question that there is some unsettling times in the housing market and credits associated with the housing market.

I would be pessimistic, however, if the Congress has its way and raises taxes. I believe the worst thing that can happen now is to allow the Congress to do that which they have said they want to do, which is to raise the taxes on people, and—because I think taking money out of the hands of investors and consumers and small-business owners would weaken the economy.And so, as I say, I'm optimistic.

So my question to you is, is your trade tariffs policy working? [SEP] Well, we just started. We didn't do anything with respect to China because we wanted to have the benefit of China having to do with North Korea. And they have been helpful. I hope they're still helpful; there's a question about that. But it got to a point where the numbers were too big. This should have been done for the last 20 years.If you look at the WTO, the World Trade Organization, that's when China really happened, economically. That's—it was like a rocket ship, because they took advantage of the rules of the WTO.And whoever was standing at this podium in this incredible White House, in the Oval Office, they should have done something about this long ago.Over the last number of years, China has taken out of this country $500 billion and more—a year. $500 billion. That would go a long way for Poland, wouldn't it? You could rebuild your whole country. And that's what China did. They rebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States. And I've changed that around. And if you look at what's going on, our market is going up like a rocket ship. I don't want their market to go down, but their market is down 32 percent in 3 months. Because we can't let them do anymore what they've done.And I watch trade deficits, because to me, deficits are very important. They're not everything, and they're not exact. Sometimes, you can have, you know, a deficit, and that's not such a bad thing. But when you have $375 billion in trade deficits and then many billions of dollars in other liabilities of all different types, you have to do something about it.We are the piggybank to the world.

But they are in a position that's not a good position for Canada. They cannot continue to charge us 300-percent tariff on dairy products, and that's what they're doing.So this is a process. It takes a little time. The European Union wouldn't talk to us. They wouldn't talk to President Obama. Wouldn't even talk to him. And then I said, That's okay, you don't have to talk to me. Jean-Claude is a tough man. He's a very good man. I like him, but he's tough. He's nasty. [] The kind of guy I want negotiating for me. But he's a tough, tough cookie.

I said, That's okay, we don't have to renegotiate any longer. We're going to put a tariff on all of the millions of cars you send into the United States. And honestly, he was in my office so quickly, from Europe, that I didn't know they had airplanes that flew that fast. [] I said, Where did you find this plane? []And we have the semblance of a deal. Because it's, to a large extent, economically all about cars. Cars are a very big factor. And they send millions of BMWs and Mercedes into our country.So we are working on trade very hard.

For example, the free trade agreement thing was meant to apply to allies, not everyone. We can fix that.

[SEP] The immediate priority was the evacuation of American citizens and embassy personnel from Libya, a task successfully executed. Subsequently, we initiated the largest financial seizure of assets in our history. Following this, sanctions were imposed, and the international community was mobilized through the United Nations, progressively tightening the pressure on Qadhafi. He faces increasing international isolation through sanctions and an arms embargo. In addition, we have provided humanitarian aid to those crossing into Tunisia and Egypt, a commitment we will maintain. Within NATO, we are engaged in discussions regarding a range of options, from continuous surveillance to monitor the situation on the ground and facilitate rapid response to potential deterioration, to further efforts concerning the arms embargo, additional humanitarian aid, and potential military options, including a no-fly zone. NATO will convene on Tuesday to consider a no-fly zone, and we have been in discussions with Arab and African nations to gauge their support for such action. Secretary Clinton will also meet with the opposition in the coming days, and we have determined it appropriate to assign a representative to interact with the opposition and identify avenues for further assistance.

Overwatch will mean that the U.S. will be in a training mission, logistical support as well as special ops.

The paramount task is to assist the Iraqi government in establishing a robust security apparatus capable of suppressing sectarian violence and maintaining law and order. The presence of al-Qaeda elements and disaffected Sunni factions further complicates the situation. Regardless of the terminology employed, the situation is undeniably complex and requires a multifaceted approach. My decision to intervene was predicated on the imperative to prevent further destabilization and to support the establishment of a constitutional government founded on principles of equitable resource distribution, federalism, and collaboration in the global war on terror.

Everywhere we have gone, we have received a warm welcome, similar to Vietnam, where millions lined the streets. Therefore, if this theory regarding my reception and my rebalance policy is based on my use of the shorter stairs in China, I believe that is an exaggeration. Any reasonable individual, particularly one from the region, would be puzzled as to how that could be indicative of our work. If you consider the remarks of leaders and ordinary citizens, as well as the tangible work we have accomplished in areas ranging from economic programs to development initiatives, to legacy of war issues, to the promotion of civil society and young people, the concern I have heard is not that our work has been unimportant or unsuccessful. The concern is whether it will continue. Other leaders have asked if America's interest, presence, and engagement will be sustained. I hope my successor will continue this engagement, because much is happening here. There are countries that are experiencing rapid growth, and there is one of the most dynamic and youngest populations in the world.

However, as we reduce the population to 40 or 50 individuals and continue to operate a multimillion-dollar facility to house them, Americans should question why we are spending this money when it is not essential for our safety and security.

Also, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and Pakistan's concerns, and whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan? [SEP] Well, on TPP, I've been around long enough to know that every trade deal is painful. Everyone's looking for a better deal. And especially with multiple parties, they're going to scrutinize it, debate it, and in an election year, score political points. Having said that, I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country, America, the region, and the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for the U.S. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the U.S. with relatively low tariffs. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest-growing markets is good for American businesses and workers. One of the biggest complaints about trade deals has been that it opens our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, and less environmental regulation. If you're signing up for TPP, you're making enforceable commitments to raise labor standards, ensure worker voice, and attend to environmental problems. This gives us the ability to engage with countries like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts. I haven't seen a credible argument that we'll be worse off with TPP. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements. But we got them done, and we'll get this done too. With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance transparency and reporting. Some argue that we should have enforceable provisions that impose tariffs if currency goes down too far. But it's hard to sort out why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, binding other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve, and we wouldn't do that. We have strengthened provisions that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. He was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan. This doesn't represent a shift in our approach. We are not re-entering the day-to-day combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country. Where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to peace talks, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people.

He and the other chiefs assured me they could implement the policy without hurting military cohesion. I believe them.

And for both presidents, did President Vazquez request your intervention in the dispute between Uruguay and Argentina regarding the mill plants? [SEP] We dedicated considerable time to addressing Uruguay's concerns about market access for certain goods. The President voiced concerns about trade-related matters, particularly the quotas on items like cows and sheep, which he deemed unfair. I assured him that I would give his requests serious consideration. You might have thought I was joking about blueberries, but I wasn't. Uruguay produces exceptional blueberries, and the fundamental question is whether Uruguayan blueberry growers will have access to the U.S. market. We discussed a range of produce. As I told the President, problems can only be solved if they are addressed openly, and we will assist where we can, providing explanations when we cannot. Regarding protectionist tendencies, I share your concern, not only within our own country but globally. I believe that free and fair trade fosters a world better equipped to combat poverty. Therefore, I strongly support completing the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with the President, drawing from my conversations with President Lula, without betraying any confidences. The United States is prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, as I explained to the President, provided there is market access for our products. This is what I told President Lula, the Europeans, and now President Vazquez. I am optimistic about reaching a deal. Our trade minister, Susan Schwab, remains in Sao Paulo to continue discussions with her Brazilian counterpart, working towards a complex but essential agreement. In response to your first question, I fully concur with the President of the United States. We have established a framework, starting with this meeting, for our experts and ministers to discuss and advance bilateral relations.

We have also explored progress with the GSP, particularly on issues to be considered in the coming weeks.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, just to clarify, is there any conceivable situation where we don't avoid the fiscal cliff by year's end? And on Iran, are you planning one last diplomatic initiative to resolve the nuclear issue, perhaps through direct talks? [SEP] Look, let's be realistic, we can all envision a scenario where we go over the cliff. If despite the election, and the obvious dangers to the economy, there's too much stubbornness in Congress to even agree on a middle-class tax cut, then middle-class families will get a big tax hike. That will be a rude shock, and I suspect it will hurt the holiday shopping season, which will then impact business planning and hiring, and we could slide back into a recession. It would be bad. It's not necessary. So, I want to reiterate: the first step is to give certainty to middle-class families – 98% of those making under $250,000 a year, 97% of small businesses – that their taxes won't go up. We can do that now. Then we can set up a structure to deal with tax reform, closing deductions and loopholes, simplifying things, and addressing entitlements. I'm ready to make big commitments to lock in deficit reductions that stabilize our deficit and start reducing our debt. I'm confident we can do it. I've been living with this for a couple of years. I know the math pretty well. It's arithmetic, not calculus. There are tough choices, but we can do this without hurting middle-class families, seniors, or families with disabled kids, and still invest in things that make us grow, like research and education, helping young people afford college. As some Republican commentators have said, a modest tax increase on the wealthy isn't going to break them; they'll still be wealthy. And it won't hurt business investment. So, we know how to do this. It's just a matter of whether we come together and say, Democrats and Republicans, we're going to do what's right for the American people. I hope that's what happens. On Iran, I very much want a diplomatic resolution. I was clear before, during, and after the campaign: we're not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon. But I think there's still a window for diplomacy. We've imposed the toughest sanctions in history. It's having an impact on Iran's economy. There should be a way for them to enjoy peaceful nuclear power while meeting their international obligations and assuring the international community that they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, as you prepare to meet with President Hollande to intensify the fight against ISIL, have you seen any indication that Russia is shifting its military operations in Syria to focus on ISIL? Under what conditions, even temporarily, would you consider allowing President Assad to remain in power if it meant a united front against ISIL? Given your opposition to working with Russia if their goal is to prop up Assad, is the goal of defeating ISIL truly achievable? [SEP] Well, let me be clear: destroying ISIL is not just a realistic goal, it's something we're going to get done. We'll use every tool at our disposal, along with our coalition partners. It will happen. It would certainly help if Russia focused on ISIL. Since ISIL claimed responsibility for bringing down their plane, I think President Putin is realizing that ISIL is a bigger threat to them than anything else in the region. The question is whether they can make the strategic shift to become effective partners with us and the other 65 countries in the counter-ISIL campaign. We don't know that yet. So far, their strikes in Syria have mostly targeted the moderate opposition, who they see as a threat to Assad. Their main goal seems to be to strengthen Assad's position, which doesn't help us against ISIL. In fact, it might even help ISIL, since they're also fighting many of the same groups that Russia is hitting. When I spoke with President Putin in Turkey, I told him he needs to go after the people who killed Russian citizens, and those aren't the groups they're currently targeting. They need to change their priorities. More broadly, I've said this before, the problem with Assad isn't just about human rights. It's not just about supporting someone who's bombing his own people. The reality is that Assad can't regain legitimacy in a country where most people hate him and will keep fighting as long as he's in power, which means the civil war will continue. So, the goal in Vienna is to see if we can all agree on a political transition process that leads to a new government, stops the fighting, and allows us to focus on this barbaric organization. Russia hasn't officially agreed to Assad leaving, but they did agree to the political transition process. We'll see in the next few weeks if we can change their mind. We all have an interest in keeping Syria intact, because we don't want complete chaos. The international community and the UN need to work together to maintain a Syrian state and move forward with a political transition. It won't be easy, but that's what we have to do. The US and its coalition partners believe that Assad can't stay in power. We can't stop the fighting if he does. Even if I cynically said that my only priority was ISIL, we still couldn't stop the fighting in Syria by those who oppose Assad. This is a practical issue, not just a moral one.

The G-8 wants Greece to stay in the Eurozone, consistent with their commitments. Greece needs to decide its options. What happens in Greece affects the U.S. Businesses hesitate to invest with uncertainty. We need firewalls to protect other countries. Banks need recapitalization.

First, the U.S.-Japan treaty predates my presidency; it's not a 'red line' I'm drawing. It's the consistent interpretation that territories under Japanese administration are covered. No shift, just applying the treaty. However, escalation is a mistake; dialogue is key. We'll encourage that diplomatically. On international law, violating it – gassing children, invading countries – demands a response, but not necessarily war every time. Syria's chemical weapons removal, 87% so far, is U.S. leadership in action *without* firing a missile. A success, not a failure. On Russia and Ukraine, a military solution is unlikely.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, as you prepare to meet with President Hollande to discuss intensifying efforts against ISIL, are there any indications that Russia is re-aligning its military strategy in Syria to specifically target ISIL? Under what circumstances, even on a temporary basis, would you entertain the possibility of President Assad remaining in power if it were to facilitate a unified front against ISIL? Given your stated position that the U.S. will not collaborate with Russia if their primary objective is to sustain Assad's regime, is the ultimate defeat of ISIL a truly attainable goal? [SEP] Look, let me be perfectly clear: destroying ISIL is not just a realistic goal, it's an absolute necessity, and we are going to get it done. We will utilize every resource at our disposal, in conjunction with our coalition partners. This is non-negotiable. It would be exceedingly helpful if Russia would redirect its focus towards ISIL. Following ISIL's claim of responsibility for the downing of their airliner, I believe President Putin is becoming increasingly cognizant of the existential threat that ISIL poses to Russia. The critical question now is whether they can make the strategic adjustments necessary to become effective partners with us and the other 65 nations that are actively engaged in the counter-ISIL campaign. This remains to be seen. Up until now, their military actions in Syria have primarily targeted the moderate opposition, whom they perceive as a threat to Assad, with the apparent aim of bolstering the Assad regime. This is counterproductive to our efforts against ISIL; indeed, it may even strengthen them, as ISIL is also engaged in combat with many of the same groups that Russia is targeting. During our recent discussions in Turkey, I conveyed to President Putin the imperative of targeting those responsible for the deaths of Russian citizens, which are not the groups they are currently attacking. They must recalibrate their priorities. More broadly, as I have stated previously, the issue with Assad transcends mere human rights considerations. It is simply not conceivable that Assad can ever regain legitimacy in a country where the vast majority of the population despises him and will continue to resist his rule, thereby perpetuating the ongoing civil war. Consequently, the objective in Vienna is to facilitate a political transition process, involving all relevant stakeholders, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, and Russia, to establish a new government, quell the violence, and enable us to refocus our collective efforts on eradicating this barbaric organization. While Russia has not formally committed to Assad's departure, they have agreed to participate in the political transition process. We will ascertain in the coming weeks whether we can shift their perspective on this matter. It is imperative that we preserve the Syrian state to prevent a complete descent into chaos, as we have witnessed in other regions. The international community and the United Nations must work in concert to maintain a functioning Syrian state and facilitate an orderly political transition. This will be a daunting challenge, but it is our unwavering focus. The position of the United States and our coalition partners remains steadfast: Assad's continued rule is untenable. We cannot achieve a cessation of hostilities with him in power. Even if I were to cynically prioritize the defeat of ISIL above all else, the United States could not suppress the opposition to Assad's rule. This is a matter of practical necessity, not merely a question of conscience. And I believe that a significant number of our coalition partners, including President Hollande, share this conviction.", "label": "Implicit"}

It's moving forward. And the—I'm going to let that process play out. I've given some parameters in terms of how I think about it: Ultimately, is this going to be good for the American people? Is it going to be good for their pocketbook? Is it going to actually create jobs? Is it actually going to reduce gas prices that have been coming down? And is it going to be, on net, something that doesn't increase climate change that we're going to have to grapple with?There's a pending case before a Nebraska judge about some of the siting. The process is moving forward, and I'm just going to gather up the facts.I will note, while this debate about Canadian oil has been raging—keep in mind this is Canadian oil, this isn't U.S. oil—while that debate has been raging, we've seen the—some of the biggest increases in American oil production and American natural gas production in our history. We are closer to energy independence than we've ever been before or at least as we've been in decades. We are importing less foreign oil than we produce for the first time in a very long time. We've got a hundred-year supply of natural gas that, if we responsibly tap, puts us in the strongest position when it comes to energy of any industrialized country around the world. If you—when I travel to Asia or I travel to Europe, their biggest envy is the incredible homegrown U.S. energy production that is producing jobs and attracting manufacturing, because locating here means you've got lower energy costs.So our energy sector is booming. And I'm happy to engage Republicans with additional ideas for how we can enhance that. I should note that our clean energy production is booming as well. And so Keystone I just consider as one small aspect of a broader trend that's really positive for the American people.And let's see—see, the—Okay, medical device tax.

Yet some of them are still disappointed, others upset, about a promise that you've made on immigration reform that has yet to come to pass. If you are reelected, what would be your strategy, what would you do different to get immigration reform passed through the Congress, especially if both Houses continue as they are right now, which is split? [SEP] Well, first of all, just substantively, every American should want immigration reform. We've got a system that's broken. We've got a system in which you have millions of families here in this country who are living in the shadows, worried about deportation. You've got American workers that are being undercut because those undocumented workers can be hired and the minimum wage laws may not be observed, overtime laws may not be observed.You've got incredibly talented people who want to start businesses in this country or to work in this country, and we should want those folks here in the United States. But right now the legal immigration system is so tangled up that it becomes very difficult for them to put down roots here.So we can be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And it is not just a Hispanic issue. This is an issue for everybody. This is an American issue that we need to fix.Now, when I came into office I said, I am going to push to get this done. We didn't get it done. And the reason we haven't gotten it done is because what used to be a bipartisan agreement that we should fix this ended up becoming a partisan issue.I give a lot of credit to my predecessor, George Bush, and his political advisers, who said this should not be just something the Democrats support; the Republican Party is invested in this as well. That was good advice then; it would be good advice now.And my hope is, is that after this election, the Latino community will have sent a strong message that they want a bipartisan effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform that involves making sure we've got tough border security, and this administration has done more for border security than just about anybody; that we are making sure that companies aren't able to take advantage of undocumented workers; that we've got strong laws in place; and that we've got a path so that all those folks whose kids often are U.S. citizens, who are working with us, living with us and in our communities, and not breaking the law and trying to do their best to raise their families, that they've got a chance to be a fuller part of our community.So what do I think will change?", "label": "Deflection"}

Ideally, Russia would accept our conclusion. They're not there yet. So, there needs to be movement because I'm worried about unmet expectations in Kosovo. That's what I meant. We'll push the process. President Putin proposed missile defense for Europe. I also made a proposal, aimed at protecting Europe, not Russia. The real threats are from rogue nations with deliverable weapons. We need to intercept such missiles. President Putin suggested joint use of radar in Azerbaijan. I said we'd look at it. But he also had doubts about my proposal. So, I suggested a group to discuss our ideas transparently, sharing technologies and radar positioning. His statement was important, recognizing an opportunity to work together.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a policy question and a personal one. The policy question is, you talked about how the immediate goal is the Bush tax cuts and making sure that they don't expire for those who earn under 200, 250,000. Republicans disagree with that strongly. They want all of the Bush tax cuts extended. Are you willing to compromise on that? Are you willing to negotiate at all, for instance, allow them to expire for everyone over $1 million? Where are you willing to budge on that?And the second one is, President Bush, when he went through a similar thing, came out and he said, This was a thumpin'. You talked about how it was humbling, or you alluded to it perhaps being humbling. And I'm wondering, when you call your friends, like Congressman Perriello or Governor Strickland, and you see 19 State legislatures go to the other side, Governorships in swing States, the Democratic Party set back, what does it feel like? [SEP] It feels bad. [] The toughest thing over the last couple of days is seeing really terrific public servants not have the opportunity to serve anymore, at least in the short term. And you mentioned--there are just some terrific Members of Congress who took really tough votes because they thought it was the right thing, even though they knew this could cause them political problems and even though a lot of them came from really tough swing districts or majority-Republican districts. And the amount of courage that they showed and conviction that they showed is something that I admire so much. I can't overstate it.And so there's a--not only sadness about seeing them go, but there's also a lot of questioning on my part in terms of could I have done something differently or done something more so that those folks would still be here. It's hard. And I take responsibility for it in a lot of ways.I will tell you, they've been incredibly gracious when I have conversations with them. And what they've told me is, you know, I--we don't have regrets because I feel like we were doing the right thing. And they may be just saying that to make me feel better, which, again, is a sign of their character and their class. And I hope a lot of them continue to pursue public service because I think they're terrific public servants.With respect to the tax cut issue, my goal is to make sure that we don't have a huge spike in taxes for middle class families. Not only would that be a terrible burden on families who are already going through tough times, it would be bad for our economy. It is very important that we're not taking a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who are most likely to spend that money on goods, services, groceries, buying a new winter coat for the kids.That's also why I think unemployment insurance is important. Not only is it the right thing to do for folks who are still looking for work and struggling in this really tough economy, but it's the right thing to do for the economy as a whole.So my goal is to sit down with Speaker-elect Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Harry and Nancy sometime in the next few weeks and see where we can move forward in a way that, first of all, does no harm; that extends those tax cuts that are very important for middle class families; also extends those provisions that are important to encourage businesses to invest and provide businesses some certainty over the next year or two.And how that negotiation works itself out, I think, is too early to say. But this is going to be one of my top priorities. And my hope is, is that given we all have an interest in growing the economy and encouraging job growth, that we're not going to play brinksmanship, but instead we're going to act responsibly.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. I'll try to be succinct. Mr. President, 2 years ago, you said that you were ready to expend political capital on the Israel-Palestinian situation. With hindsight, do you think you've fulfilled that intention? How closely do you see a linkage between what happens in Israel-Palestine and a settlement in Iraq, achieving your goals?And Prime Minister, given that you were so recently in the Middle East and the situation hasn't exactly improved since then, is there anything specific you're hoping to achieve next week when you go back? [SEP] Want me to start? I'm getting older, so you're going to have to repeat the second part of your question. [] Let me answer the first part. What's important is for people to accept the goal of two states living side by side for peace. And what has changed in the Middle East is that Israel and Palestine— at least the current leadership of both countries, or both—one entity and one country—accept that goal. That's important.To that end, the previous Prime Minister made a decision to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza, which I felt was a good decision, which would expedite the potential arrival of a state. And so to answer your question, yes, we're spending a lot of capital getting people headed in the same direction, which if you look at the history of the Middle East, is a change.Secondly, one of the reasons why there hasn't been instant success is because radicals and extremists are trying to stop the advance of a Palestinian state. Why? Because democracy is a defeat for them. That's what I strongly believe. I find it interesting that when Prime Minister Olmert reaches out to Palestinians to discuss a way forward on the two-state solution, Hizballah attacks Israel. Why? Because radicals and extremists can't stand the thought of a democracy. And one of the great ironies is that people in the Middle East are working hard to prevent people in the Middle East from realizing the blessings of a free society in a democracy.And so no question, progress has been spotty. But it's important for people to understand, one of the reasons why is, is because radicals are trying to prevent it, and they're willing to kill innocent people to prevent progress. Now, our goal is to help the Abbas Government strengthen its security forces, and we're doing that. Our goal is to help the Abbas Government form a government that adheres to the principles of the Quartet. We can't abandon the principles of the Quartet just because it may sound easy. We can't do that. When nations lay out principles, you've got to adhere to those principles, just like when we laid out a vision, you adhere to that vision.And so the Prime Minister's visit, like Condi's visit recently to the Middle East, are all aiming to help countries remove obstacles necessary to achieve the vision. And it's hard work, but it's necessary work. And so I do believe there is a—I know there's a change of attitude. And now the fundamental question is, can we help the moderates prevail? And make no mistake about it, radicals and extremists will kill in order to stop the progress. And that's what's difficult. But it should be a signal to those of us who have got the comfort of liberty to understand the consequences of this ideological struggle we're fighting. One of the consequences is the denial of a Palestinian state.This is ironic, isn't it? I think it is, and it's sad. I mean, I think, first of all, it's important to understand how much has begun—how much work there's been. I mean, I know I've had many, many meetings on this issue over the past few months. I know Secretary Rice has been immensely active on it over these past months as well. Now, some of that is visible and out there at press conferences and meetings, and a lot of it is behind the scenes.But in essence, what we've got to do is to try to resolve two issues. First of all, we need to get the release of Corporal Shalit, which, as Prime Minister Olmert made clear the other day, would then allow the release of many Palestinian prisoners as well. And this is obviously a very important issue.But then, secondly, and this is, I think, really—one of the core questions is, we are prepared to release the money to the Palestinian Authority. We are prepared to take the peace process forward and get into a process of negotiation. But we need a government on both sides that is committed to the basic principles of that negotiation. And at the present time, we are not able to achieve a national unity government on the Palestinian side. And the reason for that is that we are saying, not as a matter of dogma at all, but you can't have a government that everyone can deal with and you can then negotiate a peace between Israel and Palestine, unless it's on the basis that everyone accepts the other's right to exist. So that's the difficulty. It's not a kind of technical point; it's absolutely at the heart of it.Now, what we have got to do is to find either a way of unlocking the problem of forming that national unity government, on the principles laid down by the United Nations as well as the rest of the Quartet, or alternatively, a different way forward, but whatever way forward will have to be on the basis you get an empowered Palestinian Government with whom everyone can negotiate and deal with.Now, you know, again, it's a very, very obvious thing. It's not just for the Israelis and the Palestinians but also for the whole of the region. You know, you can't negotiate this unless everyone accepts the basic principles of the negotiation. But if people were to do that—and after all, we're only asking people to accept the position that the United Nations and, really, the whole of the international community—you could move this forward quickly. I mean, I don't think there's any doubt at all that if you could get an empowered Palestinian Government able to negotiate, Israel has made it clear it is prepared to negotiate.I'm not saying there aren't very tricky issues. There are—things like Jerusalem, the right of return, which are very, very difficult. But actually, it's not beyond our wit to put it together. We could put it together. But you need to get these initial steps taken.Now, what I'm wont to do when I go out there is just explore what is the way that we get that ability to get the negotiation underway, trying to work round these obstacles. And it's something—we were talking about Iran and Syria moments ago; it's something all of those countries could help with if they wanted to help with it. So I kind of feel one thing that is important is that everyone understands that there's no shortage of willingness, energy, commitment on our side.And believe me, I've talked about this with the President many, many times, and I don't believe there's any shortage of those qualities on his part at all. But we need to get this—we need to get the door unlocked because it's kind of barred at the moment. It needs to be opened. And that's the task, I think, for the next period. Thank you. L.A.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Kenya, what specific actions will the U.S. take to aid in the fight against al-Shabaab? Do you still consider Somalia a viable counterterrorism model? And are you concerned about potential human rights abuses by Kenyan authorities under the guise of counterterrorism? And for President Kenyatta, what further assistance do you require from the U.S. in combating al-Shabaab, and are you satisfied with the current level of support? Also, could you both address the criticism surrounding the treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals in Kenya? [SEP] Well, this has been a topic of extensive discussion and concrete action that we're now undertaking. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya dealing with primarily threats from al-Shabaab. In part because of the actions that we've taken not just with Kenya, but with AFRICOM, and the efforts, collectively, of countries to work together—Uganda, Ethiopia, others—we have systematically reduced the territory that al-Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa. That doesn't mean the problem is solved. As is true around the world, what we find is, is that we can degrade significantly the capacities of these terrorist organizations, but they can still do damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall were not large, but when they're willing to target soft targets and civilians, and are prepared to die, they can still do a lot of damage. And so what we discussed was the importance of, number one, continuing the effort to root out al-Shabaab's capacity inside of Somalia, working jointly. And as we speak, Kenya is working with Ethiopia and with the United States and others to further degrade al-Shabaab's space of operations inside of Somalia. So we have to keep that pressure going, even as we're strengthening the Somalian Government. Because part of the reason that al-Shabaab was able to emerge as a significant threat to the region was a nonfunctioning Government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long. There is now a Government and a cabinet that is credible and is working with the international community in Mogadishu. And even as we put military pressure on al-Shabaab, we also have to make sure that we're standing up an effective governance structure inside of Somalia. And we've made progress there. In addition, we have to continue to make progress in intelligence-sharing and being able to identify and prevent threats before they occur here in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. And part of our announcement today involves additional funding, additional assistance that we're providing the Kenyan security forces to deal with these very specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to make sure that the approach that's taken in rooting out potential terrorist threats don't create more problems than they're solving. And this goes to the other element of the question that you asked. What we have found, sometimes through hard experience—and I shared this with —is that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you are restricting legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, then that can have the inadvertent effect of actually increasing the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in communities that feel marginalized. And I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, part of the reason why, although we're seeing potential lone wolf attacks inside the United States, that we have not seen this sort of systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim communities or immigrant communities inside of the United States is, is that we've been very conscious to make sure that law enforcement is reaching out and cooperating and working with them, because they are our partners in this process. And the only way we're going to fight the poison that's being fed to them—to their young people through social media—is to make sure that they're our eyes and our ears and they're counseling us on how we can more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. And that's proven successful. The same will be true here in Kenya. And I was very clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people, and it will find its way through this process in cooperation with us, but our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society—in fact, embracing civil society, particularly in those communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab—that becomes more important the more significant the threat is. And not only is that practical advice, but it's the right thing to do, and it's consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and with the values that you heard espouse. Similarly, with respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this. I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. And I say that, recognizing that there may be people who have different religious or cultural beliefs. But the issue is, how does the state operate relative to people? If you look at the history of countries around the world, when you start treating people differently—not because of any harm they're doing anybody, but because they are different—that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. And when a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread. And as an African American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there's—were all sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong. So I'm unequivocal on this. If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs—[]—and doing all the other things that good citizens are supposed to do and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop. And the state does not need to weigh in on religious doctrine. The state just has to say, we're going to treat everybody equally under the law. And then, everybody else can have their own opinions. All right?", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "Q. Good morning, Mr. President, Prime Minister. I'd like to ask you both about Iran. President Bush, you've talked about it at every stop. A similar process, it seems, that is deterring North Korea from its nuclear ambitions has basically allowed North Korea to make progress toward nuclear weapons. At what point are you willing to draw a line here with Iran? And isn't Iran seemingly learning a lesson from the North Korea experience? [SEP] Ed [Edwin Chen, Bloomberg News], I just strongly disagree with your premise that the six-party talks has encouraged Iran to develop nuclear weapons. I don't know why you have even come to that conclusion because the facts are, the six-party talks is the only way to send a message to the North Koreans that the world isn't going to tolerate them having a weapon.I mean, in other words, they are—we'll see what they disclose, but we, hopefully, are in the process of disabling and dismantling their plutonium manufacturing. We're, hopefully, in the process of getting them to disclose what they have manufactured and eventually turning it over. We're, hopefully, in the process of disclosing their proliferation activities, and it's a six-party process. I mean, the only way, in my judgment, to diplomatically solve these kinds of problems with nations like Iran and North Korea, nontransparent nations, is through a multilateral process where there's more than one nation sending the same message to the leaders of these respective countries.And so I disagree with your premise. As a matter of fact, the Iranians must understand that when we come together and speak with one voice, we're serious. That's why the Prime Minister's statement was so powerful, and that's the lesson that the North Koreans are hearing. And so it's— I said the other day that, you know, one of the things that I will leave behind is a multilateralism to deal with tyrants, so problems can be solved diplomatically.And the difficulty, of course, is that sometimes economics and money trumps national security interests. So you go around asking nations—by the way, it's not a problem for Great Britain—so you say to your partners, don't sell goods; you know, let's send a focused message, all aiming to create the conditions so that somebody rational shows up. In other words, people, hopefully, are sick of isolation in their respective countries, and they show up and say, we're tired of this; there's a better way forward.And in order for that to be effective, Ed, there has to be more than one voice. So if I were the North Koreans and I were looking at Iran, or the Iranians looking at North Korea, I'd say, uh-oh, there are coalitions coming together that are bound tightly, more tightly than ever, in order to send us a focused message.And you know, let me just say one thing about the Iranian demand for civilian nuclear power: It's a justifiable demand. You just heard the Prime Minister talk about the spread of civilian nuclear power, which I support—starting in my own country, by the way. We need to be building civilian nuclear power plants.And so when the Iranians say we have a sovereign right to have one, the answer is, you bet. You have a sovereign right; absolutely. But you don't have the trust of those of us who have watched you carefully when it comes to enriching uranium because you have declared that you want to destroy democracies in the neighborhood, for example. Therefore—and this is the Russian proposal, by the way—therefore, we'll provide fuel for you, and we'll collect the fuel after you've used it so you can have your nuclear—civilian nuclear power, which undermines what the Iranians are saying, and that is, we must enrich in order to have civilian nuclear power. You don't need to enrich to have civilian nuclear power. The Russian proposal is what we support. This proposal wouldn't have happened had there not been a multilateral process.And so what these nations need to see is, we're serious about solving these problems.

One is the north-south agreement, and he was talking about the need to make sure that there is a clear understanding about how oil revenues will be shared between north and south in a certain part of the border region there, so as to make sure that there is— that this agreement that Ambassador Danforth negotiated stays intact and stays full.And the other aspect, obviously, is Darfur.

You may think I'm joking about blueberries, but Uruguay produces excellent ones. The key question is whether their blueberry growers can sell to the U.S. We discussed various produce. I told the President, 'You can't solve problems unless you address them directly. We'll assist where possible and explain why we can't where necessary.' I'm concerned about protectionism globally, not just in our country. Free and fair trade helps alleviate poverty. I support completing the Doha round of the WTO.

{"sentence": "Sir, critics argue that commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence undermines the consequences for leaking classified information, particularly concerning WikiLeaks' involvement with Russian interference. Furthermore, what is your stance on Julian Assange's offer to come to the United States, and would he be subject to charges upon arrival? [SEP] Let's not forget that Chelsea Manning served a significant prison sentence. This was not a light matter. In my judgment, due process was followed, she accepted responsibility for her actions, and the sentence was disproportionately severe compared to similar cases. Given the substantial time she had already served, commuting her sentence was a reasonable course of action. I am confident that justice has been served, and a clear message has been conveyed regarding the importance of national security. Individuals with legitimate concerns should utilize established channels and avail themselves of whistleblower protections. While some may find these protections inadequate, we must recognize that national security often involves individuals in the field whose lives are at risk. Regarding WikiLeaks, I have refrained from making broad statements. The intelligence community's findings regarding Russian hacking and WikiLeaks' potential involvement were inconclusive. I do not closely follow Mr. Assange's social media activity. I would direct you to the Justice Department for any information regarding criminal investigations or extradition matters. In this digital age, we must strive to find the right balance between accountability, transparency, and the need to safeguard ourselves from those who seek to exploit our openness.

{"sentence": "President Biden, concerning the recent announcement regarding the acceptance of citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua, what is the expected timeline for this initiative? Are there any plans to expand the number of accepted individuals or include additional countries in the program? Additionally, could you provide details on the amount of investment being made in technological improvements within the United States? And President López Obrador, how is Mexico preparing to accommodate the migrants who will be expelled from the United States? What is the intended purpose of the new migration center being established in the southern part of Mexico? Following this summit, do you anticipate any significant changes in migration policies or the overall treatment of migrants? Finally, President Biden, what specific actions are you planning to implement to address the issue of fentanyl, and what impact has the detention of Ovidio Guzmán had on this effort? And did you discuss energy sector consultations under the USMCA? [SEP] We had a broad discussion about migration, focusing on cooperation with the U.S. while also emphasizing our commitment to protecting migrants. President Biden's proposal is fundamentally sound: migrants face significant risks when crossing our country, including exploitation by human traffickers who charge exorbitant fees. These traffickers operate extensive networks and use trucks to transport hundreds of people, often leading to tragic accidents. Furthermore, many migrants are kidnapped and murdered, which is deeply distressing. Our aim is to find a comprehensive, long-term solution. As President Biden has rightly pointed out, people do not leave their homes, families, and countries for pleasure; they do so out of necessity. We must address the root causes of migration by investing in development in countries struggling with inequality and poverty, thereby making migration a matter of choice rather than a forced circumstance. In the meantime, Mexico is doing its part with limited resources, working with communities in El Salvador and Honduras, and soon expanding our efforts to Guatemala and Belize. However, we need to further promote development and well-being to ensure that those who are compelled to migrate have opportunities in their home communities. We have no plans to construct a migration center in southeastern Mexico; instead, we are focusing on providing assistance through shelters, healthcare services, and food. We applaud the U.S. administration's decision to implement an orderly migration process, as exemplified by the program for Venezuelan citizens. Since the announcement of humanitarian visas for Venezuelans, we have observed a decrease in migration flows. This new approach offers hope, allowing individuals to submit their requests through established channels. Canada's actions in this regard are also commendable. Historically, migration patterns have primarily involved individuals from Central America and Mexico, with a significant number of Mexicans seeking better opportunities in the United States. Today, there are approximately 40 million Mexicans residing in the U.S., either born in Mexico or the children of Mexican immigrants. Through our efforts to promote well-being, we have successfully reduced the number of Mexican migrants. Currently, 30 million Mexican families are benefiting from at least one well-being program. Senior citizens receive pensions, and students from low-income families receive scholarships. We have also launched a major reforestation program, providing employment to 400,000 peasants. These programs are designed to help people remain in their communities. We have built the Dos Bocas refinery and are constructing the Mayan train, both of which are creating jobs. Development is the key to addressing migration. I commend both Canada and the U.S. for adopting this approach. Unfortunately, some politicians are acting inhumanely, such as governors who are sending migrants to New York and Washington. We must seek alternative solutions and address the underlying causes of violence. For too long, we neglected our youth, labeling them as unproductive and uneducated. We now have a program that provides opportunities for young people, employing 2.4 million as apprentices and steering them away from criminal groups. My administration is committed to combating corruption and ensuring that crime and authority remain separate.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you campaigned on limiting executive overreach, criticizing President Bush's expansion of power. With Congress seemingly unable to agree on anything, do you now see it as your duty to push the boundaries of executive authority to get things done, even if it invites criticism of being an 'imperial president'? Or are you more concerned about being labeled a 'do-nothing' president due to congressional inaction? [SEP] I operate under the Constitution, period. There's no 'green light' to ignore the separation of powers. Congress controls the money, end of story. I'd love to fund a huge infrastructure project, put folks to work, and boost GDP. But without Congress on board, I'm limited. I can speed up permits, work with the private sector, but they have to pass a budget. So, no green light. What I will do, consistently, is use my legal authority to help middle-class families. Whether it's fair wages for contractors, equal pay for women, or better student loan programs, I'll seize those opportunities. That's what Americans expect. I'd rather work with Congress; they can do more, and it lasts longer. Look at immigration reform. We had a bipartisan bill in the Senate, but House Republicans are blocking it. The American people want action, and there's common ground. In that situation, I'll find ways to make progress within my authority. We'll stay within the limits of executive power.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you've mentioned potential talks with President Putin. What's your strategy going into those discussions, especially considering President Zelenskyy's insistence on the return of Crimea as a precondition for negotiations?

He's paying a steep price, but the carnage he's inflicting on Ukrainian civilians is horrific. I have no immediate plans to contact Putin. However, I'm open to dialogue if he demonstrates a genuine interest in ending the war. If that happens, I'll consult with our allies before engaging. The focus now must remain on supporting the Ukrainian people. Putin has miscalculated at every turn. He thought he'd be welcomed with open arms. He was wrong. Now, how he gets himself out of this mess is the question. I'm prepared to explore that, but only in close coordination with our NATO allies. As for Zelenskyy's conditions, we must acknowledge Ukraine's right to self-determination. They're the ones suffering the war crimes and leading the counteroffensive.

[SEP] Yes, well, the first thing, John, is to make sure we get a understanding that all of us need to agree on a long-term goal. And part of the reluctance has been—on some nations that are major economies—to participate at all, because initially, I'm confident, they thought they were going to get a free pass from any international agreement. I mean, after all, the Kyoto international agreement excluded major economies. And therefore, they probably think, well, maybe history will repeat itself.The idea is to say, look, we want to be effective. Effectiveness comes when major economies come to the table. The first step is to agree to a long-term goal. And I've talked to our sherpa about that, and he feels pretty good that people are now coming to that clear understanding that we're going to have to come to a long-term goal. Hopefully we can do it at this meeting. If not, we'll continue to press forward to get it done.Secondly, one of the—a lot of the developing world says, well, it's unfair; the developed world gets to develop, and we don't.

I mean, this is a tough issue. It's tough to get consensus. People—there's a consensus that it's a problem, but it's tough to get a consensus that all of us have a responsibility to do something about it—not just some, but all of us, so that whatever we do is effective.Bret Baier [FOX News].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about budget process. In the past, you've negotiated along with the debt ceiling with the Blue Dogs, for instance, in 2009, 2010—along with a debt ceiling increase then. Pay-as-you-go reform, you named a fiscal commission. The Republicans today are talking about maybe another committee that would work out our differences over the next few weeks. Is that something that you could talk about on the side, something that wouldn't necessarily be a concession, but something that would be a format for getting a deal done? [SEP] Yes, here's the thing, Steven. I know that Speaker Boehner has talked about setting up some new process or some new supercommittee or what have you. The leaders up in Congress, they can work through whatever processes they want. But the bottom line is either you're having good-faith negotiations in which there's give and take, or you're not.Now, there is already a process in place called the Budget Committees that could come together right now—Democrats have been asking for 19 months to bring them together—make a determination how much should the Government be spending next year. The Appropriations Committees could go through the list, and here's how much we're going to be spending for defense and here's how much we're going to be spending for education. And that's a process that's worked reasonably well for the last 50 years. I don't know that we need to set up a new committee for a process like that to move forward.What has changed, or what seems to be motivating the idea we have to have a new process is, Speaker Boehner, or at least some faction of the Republicans in the House and maybe some in the Senate, are holding out for a negotiation in theory, but in fact, basically, Democrats give a lot of concessions to Republicans, Republicans don't give anything, and then that's dubbed as compromise. And the reason that Democrats have to give is because they're worried that the Government is going to stay shut down or the U.S. Government is going to default.And again, that—you can dress it up any way you want. If that's the theory that the Republicans are going forward with, then it's not going to work.So let me just give you one specific example. I've heard at least—and I can't confirm this—that one of the ideas of this new committee is, you could talk about reductions in discretionary spending, you could talk about entitlement reform and reductions in mandatory spending, you could talk about how long you'd extend the debt ceiling, but you couldn't talk about closing corporate loopholes that aren't benefiting ordinary folks economically and, potentially, if you closed them, would allow us to pay for things like better education for kids.Well, I don't know why Democrats right now would agree to a format that takes off the table all the things they care about and is confined to the things that the Republicans care about.So again, I don't know that that's exactly what's being proposed. My simple point is this: I think Democrats in the Senate and the House are prepared to talk about anything. I'm prepared to talk about anything. They can design whatever formats they want. What is not fair and will not result in an actual deal is ransom-taking or hostage-taking, and the expectation that Democrats are paying ransom or providing concessions for the mere act of reopening the Government or paying our bills.

He said the following: Many Presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper only to find that the North Koreans either didn't promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on those promises. What makes this time different, Mr. President? [SEP] Well, you have a different administration. You have a different President. You have a different Secretary of State. You have people that are—you know, it's very important to them. And we get it done. The other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority. I don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly. I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority.And it would have been easier back then. It would have been—for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago. And I'm not just blaming President Obama. I mean, this goes back—for 25 years, this should have happened. I was given a very tough hand. I was given this, I was given the Iran deal and plenty of other problems.But we are—we're doing really well. And the Iran deal, I have to be honest, we—I did it because nuclear is always number one to me. Nuclear is number one. But on the Iran deal, I think Iran is a different country now than it was 3 or 4 months ago. I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean. I don't think they're looking so much at Syria, like they were, with total confidence. I don't think they're so confident right now.But I hope—with that being said, I hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in—and they are brutal, what we've put on Iran—I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because I'd love to be able to do that.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, you just spoke about looking forward and not backward, and you also referenced the voracious appetite of the American consumer. What role should the European and American consumer then play in the quarter that starts today? Should they be spending or saving to alter the velocity of what you just called a slow-rolling crisis? [SEP] Well, I think that each family has got to look at its circumstances and make those determinations. Obviously, there are a lot of people who are concerned about their job security, or they're concerned about seeing their savings having diminished if they were in the stock market, and I think it's an understandable response to be somewhat cautious in the midst of this kind of uncertainty.I think the best advice I would have would be to say that despite the current hardships, we are going to get through this, and so you should plan sensibly, in anticipation that this economy is going to recover and new families, young families are going to want to buy new homes, and sooner or later that clunker of a car is going to wear out and people are going to want to buy a new car. And so that basing decisions around fear is not the right way to go.We are going to get through this difficult time. And I think it is sometimes important to step back and just have some perspective about the differences between now and the Great Depression, when there were no social safety nets in place, when unemployment was 25 or 30 percent. I mean, this is a difficult time, but it's not what happened to our grandparents' generation.And so I would ask people to be confident about their own futures. And that may mean, in some cases, spending now as investments for the future. There's been a debate back home about our budget. In the midst of this crisis, should we deal with health care? Should we deal with energy? Should we deal with education? And one of the analogies I've used is a family who is having a difficult time--and I actually get letters like this occasionally from voters--one of our parents has lost their job, savings have declined, and so I'm wrestling with whether or not I should go to college, because that will require me taking out a lot of debt, and maybe it would be more responsible for me to go find any job that I can to help the family.And, you know, when I write back to those families or those individuals I say, you've obviously got to make these decisions yourself, but don't shortchange the future because of fear in the present. And that I think is the most important message that we can send not just in the United States but around the world. Barack is absolutely right. Look, surely the most important thing is that people, by the decisions that are made, can have confidence in the future, confidence to be able to make decisions about whether to save or to spend. And all the measures that we are taking--restructuring the banks, putting money into the economy, the public works, and of course, the low-carbon activities that we're encouraging as well--are designed to give people the confidence that their savings are safe; that we've sorted out the problems and are sorting out the problems in the banking system; that we have put resources into economic activity in the economy so that jobs can be saved and jobs can be created. And then people, as consumers, can make their own decisions about what they want to do.And I think that's the key to the future, that people can see that the problems are being addressed and they themselves can have the confidence either to save or to spend or to invest, confidence in the future. And I believe that we can make a big step towards creating that confidence by some of the decisions that we can make together. All right? George. Fine.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Q. Question for President Obama, on Ukraine, reportedly there are about 30,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. What guarantees can you give to the people of Eastern Ukraine, to the people in the Baltic States, Moldova, other countries that they will not be next when it comes to the Russian politics of annexation? And with regard to that also, is this a done deal? Is there any doubt in your mind that Putin will return Crimea to where it belongs, according to the West? Or is this diplomatic show of force basically just to prevent another land grab somewhere else? [SEP] On the second question first, on the issue of Crimea, it's not a done deal in the sense that the international community by and large is not recognizing the annexation of Crimea. Obviously, the facts on the ground are that the Russian military controls Crimea. There are a number of individuals inside of Crimea that are supportive of that process. There's no expectation that they will be dislodged by force. And so what we can bring to bear are the legal arguments, the diplomatic arguments, the political pressure, the economic sanctions that are already in place to try to make sure that there's a cost to that process.But I think it would be dishonest to suggest that there's a simple solution to resolving what has already taken place in Crimea. Although, history has a funny way of moving in twists and turns and not just in a straight line, so how the situation in Crimea evolves in part depends on making sure that the international community stays unified in indicating that this was an illegal action on the part of Russia.With respect to the Russian troops that are along the border of Ukraine at the moment, right now they are on Russian soil. And if they stay on Russian soil, we oppose what appears to be an effort in intimidation, but Russia has a right legally to have its troops on its own soil. I don't think it's a done deal, and I think that Russia is still making a series of calculations. And again, those calculations will be impacted in part by how unified the United States and Europe are and the international community is in saying to Russia that this is not how, in the 21st century, we resolve disputes.I think it's particularly important for all of us to dismiss this notion that somehow Russian speakers or Russian nationals inside of Ukraine are threatened and that somehow that would justify Russian action. There has been no evidence that Russian speakers have been in any way threatened. If anything, what we've seen are provocateurs who have created scuffles inside of Ukraine. But when I hear analogies, for example, to Kosovo, where you had thousands of people who were being slaughtered by their Government, the—it's a comparison that makes absolutely no sense. And I think it's important for everybody to be clear and strip away some of the possible excuses for a potential Russian action.With respect to the broader issue of States that are bordering Russia and what assurances do they have about future land grabs, as you put it, obviously, some of those countries are NATO countries. And as NATO allies, we believe that the cornerstone of our security is making sure that all of us, including the United States, are abiding by Article 5 and the notion of collective defense. And what we are now doing is organizing even more intensively to make sure that we have contingency plans and that every one of our NATO allies has assurances that we will act in their defense against any threats.That's what NATO is all about, and that's been the cornerstone of peace in the transatlantic region now for several generations. So we will uphold that. And there will be a series of NATO consultations. A NATO ministerial is going to be coming up in which we further develop and deepen those plans. But I have not seen any NATO members who have not expressed a firm determination with respect to NATO members.Now, those who are—those countries, border countries, that are outside of NATO, what we can do is what we're doing with Ukraine, which is trying to make sure that there is sufficient international pressure and a spotlight shined on the situation in some of these countries and that we're also doing everything we can to bolster their economies, make sure that through various diplomatic and economic initiatives that they feel supported and that they know that we stand by them.

Is it really possible, do you think, to make significant progress on them in the time that you have left?And, Mr. President, if I could ask you, is this really still the right man to be talking to? [SEP] Yes. No question about it; it's the right man to be talking to. And, yes, we can get a lot done. You know, we're going to have a G-8 summit in a couple of weeks' time, at which these issues to do with climate change in Africa are going to be debated and discussed. And, I mean, I hope very much, because you come together at the G-8, a bit like we did a couple of years ago at Gleneagles, and it's an opportunity for the international community, a major part of the international community, to come together and reach, in principle, agreements. And I think most people would accept that what happened at Gleneagles a couple of years ago was very important.I think what happens in Germany in a couple of weeks' time could be equally important, and that will be the time when we come to those decisions. So, of course, I want to see that through, because I've been involved in this all the way through.And the important thing, as well, is that I think you will find at the German summit that not just the G-8 countries are there, but also China and India and Brazil and Mexico, South Africa, maybe some of the African nations. And so it will be an opportunity for us to recommit on Africa and for the world to make important commitments on that and then to see if it's possible to agree the elements that could go into a more comprehensive climate change deal. So it's a pretty important thing, and that's what we're working on. You know, it's interesting, like trying to do a tap dance on his political grave, aren't you? I mean, this—you don't understand how effective Blair is, I guess, because when we're in a room with world leaders and he speaks, people listen. And they view his opinion as considered and his judgment as sound.And I find it interesting the first two questions are, is this the right guy? Well, he happens to be your Prime Minister, but more importantly, he is a respected man in the international arena. People admire him. Even if they may not agree with him 100 percent, they admire him a lot. And it's not just the American President who admires him; a lot of people admire him. And so he's effective. He's effective because he is—his recommendations to solve problems are sound. He's also effective because he is the kind of person who follows through.There's a lot of blowhards in the political process, you know, a lot of hot-air artists, people who have got something fancy to say. Tony Blair is somebody who actually follows through with his convictions and, therefore, is admired in the international community.And so I guess this is the appropriate question to ask, right guy, or is he still standing? Yes. This guy is a very strong, respected leader, and he's absolutely the right guy for me to be dealing with.Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News].

I've made my views clear: that would be an inappropriate action by the ATF, and we need to understand how it happened. Once the investigation concludes, appropriate actions will be taken.

[SEP] Our discussions encompassed a wide range of migration-related topics, with a focus on collaboration and safeguarding the well-being of migrants. The journey through Mexico presents significant dangers, as individuals are often preyed upon by unscrupulous human traffickers. These criminals subject migrants to perilous conditions, such as overcrowding in trailers, resulting in accidents and abductions. Our objective is to develop a holistic strategy that tackles the underlying causes of migration, namely poverty and inequality. People are compelled to leave their homes out of necessity, not by choice. We are actively investing in development initiatives in countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and soon Guatemala and Belize, with the goal of making migration a voluntary decision. We are not constructing migration centers; instead, we are providing essential services such as shelters, healthcare, and sustenance. We commend the US for its structured migration program for Venezuelans, which has led to a decrease in hazardous border crossings. Through support for well-being, we have successfully reduced migration from Mexico.

The success of Iraq hinges on the government's ability to make difficult decisions. They are transitioning from tyranny to democracy rapidly, and the conference will bolster their confidence in reconciling internal divisions. The momentum from the first meeting should carry over to subsequent ones. Secretary Rice will attend the next meeting, signaling a heightened level of engagement. She will advance an agenda that supports Iraq's democracy and collaborate with other nations to achieve this goal.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. The question of whether the war could go on for years. Is there a possibility there's a stalemate and it can continue for quite some time? [SEP] Well, I don't think the war can go on for years for two reasons. Number one, I don't think that they—that Russia could maintain the war forever—number one—in terms of their resources and capacity.Number two, I think that there is going to be a circumstance where, eventually, President Putin is going to decide it's not in the interest of Russia—economically, politically, or otherwise—to continue this war. But I can't predict exactly how that happens.My hope is, and my expectation is, you'll see that Ukraine makes significant progress on their offensive and that it generates a negotiated settlement somewhere along the line.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. President Bush, I would like to ask you about Pakistan. President Musharraf's party has been routed in parliamentary elections there, and it appears that he's lost the support of his people. Do you see this as the beginning of the end for him? Do you still view him as a credible leader in the fight against terrorism? [SEP] Do you believe Americans see it in their interest to help Africa? Yes. I might try to help you out on the last question. America is wealthy enough to do both.There was a victory for the people of Pakistan, and that is, there were elections held that have been judged as being fair. And the people have spoken. I view that as a significant victory. I view it as a part of the victory in the war on terror. After all, ideologues can't stand—like these guys we're dealing with—can't stand free societies. That's why they try to kill innocent people. That's why they tried to intimidate people during the election process.And so I'm—I appreciate the fact that President Musharraf has done exactly that which he said he was going to do. He said he'd hold elections; he said he would get rid of his emergency law. And so it's now time for the newly elected folks to show up and form their Government. And the question then is, will they be friends of the United States? And I certainly hope so.We view Pakistan as an important ally. We've got common interests. We've got interests in dealing with radicals who killed Benazir Bhutto. We've got interests in helping make sure there's no safe haven from which people can plot and plan attacks against the United States of America and Pakistan. And so that's my take on the elections. Thank you, and whether American interests coincides with African interests, I would say, yes. Yes. One should ask what the whole idea of the United States is about. The U.S. is a melting pot of all the races and nationalities of the world. Your country has a large content of African Americans, so that I would expect that constituency of Africa—and incidentally, the African Union has itemized the people of African descent as the sixth region of Africa. And so we look on the African Americans as our kith and kin, and they constitute a sizeable constituency in the United States. It should be in their interest to support any help the United States can extend to Africa. That's one.Two, we are all moving into a global village, and problems overspill easily, especially with the free movements of people and trade, so that if the United States should lock itself into isolationism and think they are safer there, then I would say, perhaps they don't know what is coming, because global village is a reality. Migration cannot be stopped, and if you do not help, then the vibrant youth of Africa, driven by the technological age forces—they watch television, the Internet, and so forth—they want to move and see what's happening around the world. They will come to you, and if you do not help us to prepare this youth, then whatever youth would land on your shores would come with all the roughness, the hurry, and that would be your headache.So I believe it's enlightenment for the United States Government to want to support them here. And then we talk terrorism, which has no bounds. As evidence, when the 9/11 happened in your country, it wasn't only Americans who became victims; some Ghanaians died in that event, and shows we have common interests somewhere. So these and other factors should account for why the United States, perhaps industrially and otherwise the most advanced country in the world, should be concerned about the plight of other peoples. Thank you.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, with the December 11th deadline looming for the continuing resolution, and considering the various pressing matters tied to it – from funding military operations to addressing the Ebola crisis – what's your gut feeling? Are we headed for another government shutdown? And to what extent does this potential crisis influence your decision-making on immigration policy? [SEP] Well, look, I'm trusting Senator McConnell's assurance that a shutdown won't happen. There's simply no justification for it. We've been down that road before, and it was a disaster for everyone involved. Ultimately, we ended up resolving things in the same way we would have if we hadn't shut down the government in the first place. So, it's a pointless exercise, and I believe both Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner understand that. But let's be clear about the bigger picture. Disagreement is part of democracy. In our system, where you can have a Congress and a President from different parties with fundamentally different views, the key is how you manage those differences. The sensible approach is to identify the areas where we disagree, fight for our positions, and then collaborate on the issues where we find common ground. That's how it's always been, even during the Reagan era when he worked with a Democratic Congress. They didn't let disagreements on one issue prevent them from working together on others. I expect the same approach here. I understand that some Republicans strongly disagree with me on immigration reform, and that's fine. They can argue their case. But shutting down the government over it makes no sense. It's like me shutting down the government every time they try to repeal healthcare reform.

They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them. They're done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are—a very, very large, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A great law firm. Or you know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the—you know, the detail. You'd get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times.

And what will be interesting to see is who comes to the--who represents Russia at the G-8, for example. It will be interesting to see--it will help, I think, give some insight as to how Russia intends to conduct foreign policy over--after Vladimir Putin's Presidency. And I can't answer the question yet. I can say that it's in our interests to continue to have relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation matters, it's in our interest to be able to make sure that materials that could cause great harm aren't proliferated. It's in our interest to work together on Iran. As I said, I think, in this room the last time I was here, I appreciated the fact that Vladimir Putin told the Iranians that they will provide--they, Russia--will provide enriched uranium to run the Bushehr power plant, thereby negating the need for the Iranians to enrich in the first place. I thought that was a constructive suggestion. And we need to be in a position to be able to work with Russia on Iran. There's a lot of areas where--yesterday, for example, with the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, I talked about a missile defense system in Europe. But I believe it's in our interests to try to figure out a way for the Russians to understand the system is not aimed at them but aimed at the real threats of the 21st century, which could be a launch from a violent regime--a launch of a weapon of mass destruction. So there's areas where--and so it's a--I'm going to try to leave it so whoever my successor is will be able to have a relationship with whoever is running foreign policy in Russia.

The key is to remember that engaging with Russia is vital, even when challenging. We need their cooperation on issues like preventing nuclear proliferation and addressing the Iranian nuclear program. I recall Putin's offer to provide Iran with enriched uranium for their Bushehr plant, a positive step. Missile defense in Europe is another area where we must seek understanding.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Chris Ship from ITV News.Mr. President, you, yourself, acknowledge the controversial timing of your comments on the EU referendum and the spirited debate that we're having here. And I think you're right. In the weeks before your arrival here, Leave campaigners have said that you're acting hypocritically. America would not accept the loss of sovereignty that we have to accept as part of the EU. America would not accept the levels of immigration from Mexico that we have to accept from the EU. And therefore, in various degrees of politeness, they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. [Laughter] With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right decision to intervene in this debate? And can I ask you this: Crucially, what happens if the U.K. does decide in June to leave the European Union? [SEP] Well, first of all, let me repeat: This is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make. I'm not coming here to fix any votes. I'm not casting a vote myself. I'm offering my opinion. And in democracies, you—everybody should want more information, not less. And you shouldn't be afraid to hear an argument being made. That's not a threat. That should enhance the debate.Particularly, because my understanding is that some of the folks on the other side have been ascribing to the United States certain actions we'll take if the U.K. does leave the EU. So they say, for example, that, well, we'll just cut our own trade deals with the United States. So they're voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do. I figured you might want to hear it from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. []And on that matter, for example, I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done, and the U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue, not because we don't have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries, rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements, is hugely inefficient.Now, to the subject at hand, obviously, the United States is in a different hemisphere, different circumstances, has different sets of relationships with its neighbors than the U.K. does. But I can tell you this. If right now I've got access to a massive market where I sell 44 percent of my exports, and now I'm thinking about leaving the organization that gives me access to that market and that is responsible for millions of jobs in my country and responsible for an enormous amount of commerce and upon which a lot of businesses depend, that's not something I'd probably do.And what I'm trying to describe is a broader principle, which is, in our own ways—I mean, we don't have a common market in the Americas—but in all sorts of ways, the United States constrains itself in order to bind everyone under a common set of norms and rules that makes everybody more prosperous.That's what we built after World War II. The United States and the U.K. designed a set of institutions, whether it was the United Nations or the Bretton Woods structure, IMF, World Bank, NATO, across the board. Now, that, to some degree, constrained our freedom to operate. It meant that occasionally we had to deal with some bureaucracy. It meant that on occasion we have to persuade other countries and we don't get a hundred percent of what we want in each case. But we knew that by doing so, everybody was going to be better off, partly because the norms and rules that were put in place were reflective of what we believe. If there were more free markets around the world and an orderly financial system, we knew we could operate in that environment. If we had collective defense treaties through NATO, we understood that we could formalize an architecture that would deter aggression, rather than us having, piecemeal, to put together alliances to defeat aggression after it already started. And that principle is what's at stake here. And the last point I'll make on this—until I get the next question, I suspect—[]—is that, as David said, this magnifies the power of the U.K. It doesn't diminish it. On just about every issue, what happens in Europe is going to have an impact here. And what happens in Europe is going to have an impact in the United States.We just discussed, for example, the refugee and the migration crisis. And I've told my team—which is sitting right here, so they'll vouch for me—[]—that we consider it a major national security issue that you have uncontrolled migration into Europe, not because these folks are coming to the United States, but because if it destabilizes Europe, our largest trading bloc—trading partner, it's going to be bad for our economy. If you start seeing divisions in Europe, that weakens NATO. That will have an impact on our collective security.Now, if in fact I want somebody who's smart and common sense and tough and is thinking, as I do, in the conversations about how migration is going to be handled, somebody who also has a sense of compassion and recognizes that immigration can enhance, when done properly, the assets of a country, and not just diminish them, well, I want David Cameron in the conversation. Just as I want him in the conversation when we're having conversations—discussions about information sharing and counterterrorism activity. There—precisely because I have confidence in the U.K., and I know that if we're not working effectively with Paris or Brussels, then those attacks are going to migrate to the United States and to London, I want one of my strongest partners in that conversation. So it enhances the special relationship. It doesn't diminish it.. Let me just make, Chris, one point in response to that. I mean, this is our choice, nobody else's; the sovereign choice of the British people. But as we make that choice, it surely makes sense to listen to what our friends think, to listen to their opinion, to listen to their views. And that's what Barack has been talking about today.But it's also worth remembering as we make this choice, it's a British choice about the British membership of the European Union. We're not being asked to make a choice about whether we support the German style of membership or the Italian style of membership. Britain has a special status in the European Union. We're in the single market; we're not part of the single currency. We're able to travel and live and work in other European countries, but we've maintained our borders, because we're not in the Schengen no-border zone.And on this vital issue of trade, where Barack has made such a clear statement, we should remember why we are currently negotiating this biggest trade deal in the whole world and in the whole world's history, between the European Union and the United States. It's because Britain played an absolutely leading part in pushing for those talks to get going. Indeed, we announced them at the G-8 in Northern Ireland, when Britain was in the chair of that organization. We set the agenda for what could be an absolutely game-changing trade deal for jobs, for investment, because we were part of this organization.So I just want to add those important points.I think we have a U.S. question now. .

{"sentence": "Mr. President, Senator Reid's letter requests executive action on the debt ceiling, a path your administration has seemingly rejected, including invoking the 14th Amendment. Congressman Clyburn even cited the Emancipation Proclamation as precedent for executive action when Congress is gridlocked. So, beyond your stated refusal to negotiate, is there any contingency plan under consideration, and if not, why is every alternative being dismissed? [SEP] Look, folks, let's be clear. This isn't about fancy legal maneuvers or pulling rabbits out of hats. This is about whether the United States honors its obligations. We're not some fly-by-night operation that skips out on its bills. The solution is straightforward: Congress needs to authorize us to pay what we already owe. If they're too timid to make the tough choices themselves, they can hand me the reins. Senator McConnell floated a similar idea before, and I'd gladly take him up on it. But if they insist on holding the purse strings, then they need to do their job and get this done. There are no shortcuts, no loopholes, no easy escapes. Congress authorizes the spending, they mandate the expenditures, and then they conveniently forget to raise the debt ceiling to cover it? That's not how this works. Raising the debt ceiling isn't about greenlighting new spending; it's about paying for what Congress has already approved. The consequences of default would be catastrophic, as I've already stated. So, while I appreciate the desire for a quick fix, there's only one real solution: Congress needs to authorize the payment of the bills they've already incurred. The notion that some Republicans would hold the nation's credit hostage to get their way on spending priorities is, frankly, un-American.

John Kerry invested an enormous amount of time. In the end, it's up to the two parties to make a decision. We can lead them to resolve some of the technical issues and to show them a path, but they've got to want it.With respect to Ukraine, I think that we have done everything that we can to support the Ukrainian Government and to deter Russia from moving further into Ukraine. But short of going to war, there are going to be some constraints in terms of what we can do if President Putin and Russia are ignoring what should be their long-term interests.Right now if—what we've done is impose sufficient costs on Russia that, objectively speaking, they should—President Putin should want to resolve this diplomatically, get these sanctions lifted, get their economy growing again, and have good relations with Ukraine.

[SEP] To the latter, I—look, I mean, he's a neighbor.

And that's why there will be action in the United Nations here early next week as we work collaboratively to continue to send a clear message.In terms of troop levels, there is going to be enormous speculation, again, about what decision I will make. I can only tell you, Deb, that it's going to be based upon the recommendations of Secretary Gates, General Petraeus, the Joint Chiefs. My sole criterion is, whatever we do, it ought to be in the context of success.If we fail in Iraq, the consequences for world peace will be enormous; the consequences for the security of the United States will be enormous. And therefore, my question is, what does it take to succeed? And we're not going to let politics drive my decision—again.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, who in the Republican Party needs to hear the message of inclusivity? [SEP] Well, I'm concerned that, following the defeat, the inclination will be to look inward and impose strict ideological requirements. This party will rebound. But the party's message must be that different viewpoints are included. Take, for example, the immigration debate. It's a very contentious issue. The problem with the initial debate was that some people said, 'Republicans don't like immigrants.' Now, that may be fair or unfair, but that's the image that emerged. And if the image is that we don't like immigrants, then there's probably someone else out there saying, 'Well, if they don't like the immigrants, they probably don't like me as well.' So, my point is that our party has got to be compassionate and broadminded. I remember the 1964 elections. My dad happened to be running for the United States Senate then and, you know, got landslided with the Johnson landslide in the State of Texas. But it wasn't just George Bush who got defeated, the Republican Party was pretty well decimated at the time. At least that's what the pundits viewed it. And then '66, there was a resurgence.

That will take a while. We're also looking at whether the international community, through the UN, can play a larger role. There's a real concern because there are several million people in Haiti, and the diaspora could cause some real, shall we say, confusion in the Western Hemisphere.

He's paying a very heavy price for failing to do it, but he's inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine, bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes.

The treaty with Japan isn't something I just invented; it's been the consistent interpretation for years that Japanese-administered territories are covered. So, no new 'red line' from me. We're simply applying the existing agreement. That being said, I've told the Prime Minister that escalation isn't the answer. We need dialogue and trust between Japan and China, and we'll be pushing for that through diplomacy. As for international law, we believe in it. When you gas kids or invade another country, you're breaking the rules. But that doesn't mean the U.S. has to go to war every single time.

Countries supplying weapons to Hamas must stop. The international community must pressure them to stop providing weapons. Hamas, if they desire a durable cease-fire, must stop arming. Countries bordering Gaza must work to stop smuggling. It's a difficult task, with tunnels and opportunities for those who want to disrupt democracy to provide weapons.

Is Karzai right? And can Pakistan's new government fight these terrorists? [SEP] First, we'll look into Karzai's claims with his help. No doubt, some extremists cross from Pakistan into Afghanistan. That's a problem for us, for Afghanistan, and for Pakistan. We share an enemy: extremists who use violence to disrupt or prevent democracy. Al Qaeda is still there. We've hit them hard globally, including in Pakistan, and we'll keep the pressure on with our Pakistani friends. I hope the Pakistani government understands the danger of extremists in their country. I think they do. I'll discuss it with their Prime Minister on Monday. Pakistan is an ally, a friend. We all – US, Pakistan, Afghanistan – share an enemy. I recall a White House meeting with Presidents Musharraf and Karzai where we discussed cross-border cooperation to stop dangerous elements from training and entering Afghanistan, then returning home with skills to use against the government. We made some progress, but it's still a tough fight. We were encouraged by the provincial elections there. We'll keep helping the government fight extremists and develop a counterinsurgency strategy using aid to boost the economy. It's a challenge, and we're better together.

{"sentence": "Q. Four-point-nine. [Laughter] The GDP of your country, you managed to grow it almost 3—2.6 trillion. So, on the contrary—of course, there is nothing to compare between Greek and United States economy—but on the contrary, Greece, the last 7 years is following the treatment of the financial institutions—the foreign financial institutions, and we're still in the eye of the storm of the recession. So, in the same time, there is no discussion about the debt relief. So my question is, how far this economy can go with this reform programs without any discussion of the debt relief? How far this relationship between Greece and the foreign institutions can last? [SEP] Well, you're right that it—you can't entirely compare between the United States and Greece for a range of reasons, not just because of the size of the economy We went through a very severe contraction We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I came into office In fact, the economy was contracting faster than it did during the Great Depression But we were able to intervene, apply lessons learned, and stabilize and then begin growth againBut I do believe that one of the lessons we tried to apply is that it is important to combine structural reforms and good fiscal stewardship with a growth strategy Because when your economy is growing and more revenue is coming in, that helps relieve debt And sometimes, if your only approach is cutting spending at a time when the economy is contracting, then the economy will contract further, and that could add debtNow, the advantage we had is that the dollar is the reserve currency of the world Even in the midst of crisis, people were still buying US Treasury bills We were not part of a broader arrangement like the euro zone So it gave us some additional flexibilityAnd—but the key lesson that we've drawn from our experience—and it's true that we recovered faster and better, frankly, than most of Europe—is that particularly when the economy is still struggling, putting people back to work, finding ways to spur economic activity ultimately can help to reduce the structural deficits and debts that countries experienceI think the path that Greece is currently on is the right one You've engaged in some very difficult structural reforms And I think the Greek people—although it is difficult and challenging, and the politics of it, I know, are not good—should appreciate the fact that in this global economy, the Greek economy was going to have to go through some structural reforms We all do, all the time The United States has to go through structural reforms in terms of improving our education system or revamping our infrastructure or looking at some regulations that weren't properly controlling excesses on Wall Street So we initiated—or health care reform—we had to initiate a whole range of structural reformsThey're not the same as the ones that Greece has had to do, but these were necessary reforms And the Prime Minister and his government being willing to move forward on those, I think will lead to Greece being more competitive and a more attractive place for investment in the future Look, and the Greek people are entrepreneurial There are enormous resources in this country My hope is, is that more and more investors around the world see an opportunity to do business here in Greece But even as you have those structural reforms, our argument has always been that when an economy contracted this fast, when unemployment is this high, that there also has to be a growth agenda to go with it And it is very difficult to imagine the kind of growth strategy that's needed without some debt-relief mechanismNow, the politics of this are difficult in Europe And I think in fairness to some of the governments up north that I know are not always popular here in Greece, it's important to recognize that they have their own politics And their populations and their institutions often are resistant to some of these debt-relief formulasBut I think that having seen Greece begin many of these difficult steps toward structural reform, having shown a commitment to change, with the Greek people having endured some significant hardships for many years now, there should be an opportunity, I think, for both sides to recognize that if we can come up with a durable solution, as opposed to each year or every 6 months having a new negotiation, that that could potentially be good for everyone And now that the Greek economy is growing again, the timing may be rightWhite House Press Secretary Joshua R Earnest The first question from a White House reporter will come from Jerome Cartillier of AFP [Agence France-Presse] Jerome", "label": "Explicit"}

Why did you wait so long?And for the 15,000 migrants that Canada will welcome, why so few? What have we offered to the U.S. in exchange?Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Christian. We've known for a long time theoretically what modernization needed to be made to the Roxham Road, to the agreement. We couldn't simply shut down Roxham Road and hope that everything would resolve itself, because we would have had problems. The border is very long. People would have looked for other places to cross.And so that's why we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement so that someone who attempts to cross between official crossings will be subject to the principle—the same principle as someone who should seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive at.Now, for people who are coming from the U.S., that is where they should be asylum seekers, using this means of uniformly applying the agreement, which we knew theoretically would be the solution, but it takes complex processes to manage the border. It took months before we could move forward with the announcement. But by doing so, we protected the integrity of the system. And we're also continuing to live up to our obligations with respect to asylum seekers.At the same time, we continue to be open to regular migrants, and we will increase the number of asylum seekers who we accept from the hemisphere—the Western Hemisphere—in order to compensate for closing these irregular crossings.Thank you.Haiti [The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q.

Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in , where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run—they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in , and the diaspora could cause some real—how can I say it?—confusion in the Western Hemisphere.And so—but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some.

I said jokingly, in the beginning, that I wish it was Poland which disturbed the trade balance of the United States and our exports to the United States, but I do believe that our cooperation is going to develop well on partners, like principles. The trade deal with South Korea has been fully renegotiated and is ready for signature. We may sign it at the United Nations or shortly thereafter. That was a terrible deal for the United States. Now it's a fair deal. But that's been fully renegotiated, in addition to Mexico and some of the others that are very close.Thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you.

[SEP] Protesting is a great part of our democracy. I've been protested against for 8 years. I wouldn't tell people to be silent. But elections matter, voting matters, being informed matters. Don't take our government for granted. Democracy is hard work. If 43% don't vote, democracy is weakened. If we can't tell facts from propaganda, we have problems. If people won't compromise, democracy breaks down. Understand the foundations of democracy and engage continuously. There's complacency. Young people forget the Cold War. There's an easy equivalence between the U.S. and Russia, but we have flaws and make mistakes. The U.S. has been good for Germany, providing security and rebuilding it.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, you've been able to fulfill many of your promises. Immigration reform isn't one of them. Just this last weekend, the  DREAM Act failed cloture by five votes. And five Democrats didn't support it; three Republicans did. How are you going to be able to keep your promise when the Republicans control the House when you haven't been able to do so with Democrats controlling both the Senate and the House, and when Republicans say they want to focus on border security before they do anything on immigration? [SEP] Well, let me say, there are a number of things that I wanted to get accomplished that we did not get accomplished. For example, collective bargaining for firefighters and public safety workers--that was something that I thought was important. We didn't get it done. I'm disappointed in that. I think we're still going to have to figure out how we work on energy, and that's an area that I want to immediately engage with Republicans to figure out.But I will tell you, maybe my biggest disappointment was this DREAM Act vote. You know, I get letters from kids all across the country--came here when they were 5, came here when they were 8; their parents were undocumented. The kids didn't know--kids are going to school like any other American kid, they're growing up, they're playing football, they're going to class, they're dreaming about college. And suddenly they come to 18, 19 years old, and they realize, even though I feel American, I am an American, the law doesn't recognize me as an American. I'm willing to serve my country, I'm willing to fight for this country, I want to go to college and better myself, and I'm at risk of deportation.And it is heartbreaking. That can't be who we are, to have kids--our kids, classmates of our children--who are suddenly under this shadow of fear through no fault of their own. They didn't break a law; they were kids.So my hope and expectation is that, first of all, everybody understands I am determined and this administration is determined to get immigration reform done. It is the right thing to do. I think it involves securing our borders, and my administration has done more on border security than any administration in recent years. We have more of everything: ICE, Border Patrol, surveillance, you name it.So we take border security seriously. And we take going after employers who are exploiting and using undocumented workers, we take that seriously. But we need to reform this immigration system so we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants. And at minimum, we should be able to get the DREAM Act done.And so I'm going to go back at it, and I'm going to engage in Republicans who I think some of them, in their heart of hearts, know it's the right thing to do, but they think the politics is tough for them.Well, that may mean that we've got to change the politics. And I've got to spend some time talking to the American people and others have to spend time talking to the American people, because I think that if the American people knew any of these kids--they probably do, they just may not know their status--they'd say, of course we want you. That's who we are. That's the better angels of our nature.And so one thing I hope people have seen during this lame duck: I am persistent. I am persistent. If I believe in something strongly, I stay on it. And I believe strongly in this.And I am happy to engage with the Republicans about--if they've got ideas about more on border security, I'm happy to have that conversation. And I think that it is absolutely appropriate for the American people to expect that we don't have porous borders and anybody can come in here any time. That is entirely legitimate.But I also think about those kids. And I want to do right by them, and I think the country is going to want to do right by them as well.Mike Emanuel [FOX News].", "label": "Deflection"}

We're one of the few nations in the world that don't have paid leave for our workers.And so what we're doing is—we can't afford to have—and by the way, in the meantime, they got a 43—45-percent increase in salary, et cetera. There's a lot of good things that happened in that.And if in fact this shuts down over the question of 1 to 5 paid—or 7 or 9 or whatever the number is that've been negotiating—of paid leave days, it's going to immediately cost 750,000 jobs and cause a recession.And so what I made really clear is that—what was negotiated was so much better than anything they ever had that it's worth—and they all signed on to it, by the way.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, during your meeting with Prime Minister Najib, considering the allegations of corruption and human rights abuses, what specific concerns did you voice regarding the 1MDB matter and the imprisonment of his political adversaries? [SEP] Let's address the refugee situation first. The Paris attacks occurred just a week prior. The news cycle moves so rapidly that we sometimes lose perspective. The Paris attacks were recent and impactful, and people are understandably concerned given the similarities between Paris and many American cities. That's why the House acted swiftly. I hope that now that we have had some time to pause and reflect, people will recognize that refugees arriving in the United States undergo the most rigorous vetting process. The process, developed over several administrations on a bipartisan basis, is exceptionally thorough and typically takes 18 to 24 months for approval. The House legislation, while seemingly straightforward, could effectively shut down the refugee program if it becomes overly bureaucratic. Adding layers of bureaucracy that don't enhance screening but make processing impossible would be counterproductive. When I spoke of betraying our values, I was referring to suggestions of prioritizing Christian refugees over Muslims, or fearing a 4-year-old orphan. Those of you who visited the refugee center and saw the children understand who we're talking about. If you're a parent and you saw those children, you'd understand that we need to provide them with a home in America. Most people, knowing the screening process, would agree. Regarding Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on investigations within the United States, and I certainly won't comment on foreign investigations. However, I did emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and combating corruption with Prime Minister Najib, as I have with leaders in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These are obstacles to development and contribute to poverty and stunted growth. Countries that address these issues will prosper, regardless of resources or geography. I also emphasized the importance of civil society and a free press. Countries are at different stages of development, and we don't expect everyone to follow the same path as the United States. But some fundamental principles are important for us to uphold as friends and partners. Consider Myanmar, which recently held a historic election after 40 years of military rule. They won't become Sweden overnight, but there's a significant shift occurring, and we want to encourage that. Our work through the Open Government Partnership and TPP is designed to raise the bar. Some will advance, some will regress, but the overall direction is towards a world where ordinary people are treated fairly, there's rule of law, transparency, accountable governments, people's voices are heard, women are treated equally, and minorities are not discriminated against.

For President Bush, how deep and how long will the economic recession be in the United States, and how will it affect Mexico?And what is your perspective, Mr. President, of the reform presented by President Calderon in Mexico?And for all three of you, what's the security context that exists with regard to what's happening to NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia after Colombia carried out a military invasion in Ecuador? [SEP] First of all, I—we're not in a recession, we're in a slowdown. We grew in the fourth quarter of last year. We haven't had first-quarter growth statistics yet, but there's no question, we're in a slowdown. And yes, people are concerned about it, obviously. I'm—of all the three of us standing up here, I'm probably the most concerned about the slowdown. After all, it's affecting the people who I have the honor of representing.That's why we passed, in working with the Congress, a significant progrowth economic package that will pass back rebates to our citizens, starting in the second week of May. Part of that package also included incentives for large and small businesses to invest in the year 2008. I think this is going to have a positive effect on the economy. Experts say it's going to have a positive effect on the economy. And so we'll see what happens there. The key is for Congress not to raise taxes during this period of time and send a signal that they're not going to raise taxes.You know, the President is plenty capable of handling reform. She's a—he's a good, honest man who cares deeply about the people of Mexico. And he'll do what he thinks is right for the country of Mexico.And in terms of President Uribe, we got no better friend in South America than President Uribe. He believes strongly in rule of law. He's a reformer, and he's working hard to protect his country from a bunch of narcotraffickers who murder innocent people to achieve their objectives. And he ought to have our support. He has the support of the United States of America in many ways, but if we don't agree to a free trade agreement that we honest— negotiated in good faith with them, it will undermine his efforts, and it will destabilize parts of the world. And it would be a big mistake for the Congress to turn its back on Colombia. I simply want to stress the measures Mexico is adopting before this situation—this slowdown of economic growth in the United States, which obviously affects us. More than 82 percent of our exports go to the United States, and we're adopting a number of measures. One of them is a very aggressive program for public expenditure and infrastructure, not just private spending. To give you an idea, Mexico is going from spending 3 percentage points of the GDP per year on infrastructure to over 51⁄2 percent of the GDP on infrastructure.We're talking about Mexico this year having expenses for infrastructural programs of about $500 billion for private-public programs. That's already showing up in the figures of the first quarter of the year.We're also working on an anticyclic program with very aggressive tax stimulus package for investment in the poorest regions of Mexico, where whoever invests there will get a 100-percent deduction on all investments, and the Federal Government, for a year and a half, will pay all expenses associated with social security, with labor—all the labor costs associated with social security. And that's a very, very strong stimulus package.The first data coming in indicates that for Mexico, our economic activity had 4.25percent growth rate per year. The figures for February and March indicate that industrial activity continues to show about 4 percent growth. So it's a difficult time because of the enormous interconnection among our economies, but we are prepared to face the situation and at a slower place than the one we've had in the past. But we are dealing with the situation. We are moving with everything at the Government's disposal to accelerate the growth of the Mexican economy.I hope that this situation will not continue for very long and that soon the authorities in the United States will be able to completely overcome the situation. I think that the steps taken so far by the fiscal tax monetary authorities in the United States and the Bush administration—and in general—have been appropriate. They have been the right measures, and we hope that they will very soon demonstrate effects so that we have a quick recovery among all our economies. I would just say that in spite of a slowdown of the economy in Canada, the bases of our economy are stable and solid. And we have undertaken measures to ensure the continuous growth in the future.Now, as far as the Colombia situation is concerned, Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with Colombia. And it's important also for the United States and for Mexico to benefit from free trade Colombia.Last year, in the summit, I said that Colombia can have drug trafficking with our countries without a free trade agreement, but if you want legitimate business for all our economies, we need to pursue free trade agreements with Colombia. And I said in New York a few months ago that I worry if the United States in the end refuses this agreement with Colombia.We have important alliance in Colombia. Colombia is fighting against political violence, against the FARC. They fight against drug traffickers. And I think that a rejection of or turning our backs to such an ally as Colombia is—could create long-term problems for our countries in South America.[]——free trade agreement to have drug trade with Colombia. You're going to have that anyway. If you want to have legitimate trade and see that country progress economically, we need to have a free trade agreement. We need to have a trade agreement with countries like Colombia.And I do worry that if the Colombian free trade agreement is rejected, particularly when that country has taken a lot of efforts to fight political violence and corruption and FARC and drug traffickers, if the United States and our allies turn their back on an important ally in this region, that that will have long-term security consequences for all of our countries in North America. So that does worry the Government of Canada.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, would you explicitly discourage Israel from launching a military strike against Iran? And do you anticipate that Iran will be actively pursuing nuclear weapons by the time you leave office? [SEP] I've consistently emphasized to all parties that diplomacy must be the primary approach to resolving this issue. The most effective diplomatic strategy involves the United States working in concert with other nations to convey a clear message: continued enrichment will result in isolation and economic consequences. As you may remember, I collaborated closely with Vladimir Putin on this matter. When questioned at a press conference regarding Iran's right to a civilian nuclear program, I stated, 'Certainly, but they cannot be trusted to enrich.' Consequently, I supported Russia's proposal to supply enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power program and then retrieve the spent uranium, thereby eliminating the need for the Iranian regime to engage in enrichment activities. Therefore, we will persist in pursuing diplomatic solutions. Thank you all for your time. It's been a pleasure.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the United States have a core national security interest in stopping the slaughter in Syria or merely a strong moral desire to see the violence end? And at what point does the cost of not intervening in a more direct way than you have done so far outweigh the cost of doing so?And if I may ask, President Park, President Obama's critics have warned that failing to act on perceived violations of U.S. red lines in Syria could embolden U.S. enemies elsewhere, including in North Korea. Are you convinced that Kim Jong Un has taken the U.S. and South Korean warnings seriously, and do you see the withdrawal of two missiles from a test site as a sign that he's willing to deescalate the situation? [SEP] Well, Stephen, I think that we have both a moral obligation and a national security interest in, A, ending the slaughter in Syria, but, B, also ensuring that we've got a stable Syria that is representative of all the Syrian people and is not creating chaos for its neighbors. And that's why for the last 2 years, we have been active in trying to ensure that Bashar Asad exits the stage and that we can begin a political transition process.That's the reason why we've invested so much in humanitarian aid. That's the reason why we are so invested in helping the opposition and why we've mobilized the international community to isolate Syria. That's why we are now providing nonlethal assistance to the opposition, and that's why we're going to continue to do the work that we need to do.And in terms of the costs and the benefits, I think there'd be severe costs in doing nothing. That's why we're not doing nothing. That's why we are actively invested in the process. If what you're asking is, are there continuing reevaluations about what we do, what actions we take in conjunction with other international partners to optimize the day when—or to hasten the day when we can see a better situation in Syria, we've been doing that all along and we'll continue to do that.I think that, understandably, there is a desire for easy answers. That's not the situation there. And my job is to constantly measure our very real and legitimate humanitarian and national security interests in Syria, but measuring those against my bottom line, which is what's in the best interest of America's security and making sure that I'm making decisions not based on a hope and a prayer, but on hard-headed analysis in terms of what will actually make us safer and stabilize the region.I would note—not to answer the question that you lobbed over to —that you suggested even in your question a perceived crossing of a red line. The operative word there, I guess, Stephen, is perceived. And what I've said is that we have evidence that there has been the use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, but I don't make decisions based on perceived. And I can't organize international coalitions around perceived. We've tried that in the past, by the way, and it didn't work out well.So we want to make sure that we have the best analysis possible. We want to make sure that we are acting deliberately. But I would just point out that there have been several instances during the course of my Presidency where I said I was going to do something, and it ended up getting done. And there were times when there were folks on the sidelines wondering why hasn't it happened yet and what's going on and why didn't it go on tomorrow? But in the end, whether it's bin Laden or Qaddafi, if we say we're taking a position, I would think at this point the international community has a pretty good sense that we typically follow through on our commitments. . With regard to actions towards Syria, what kind of message would that communicate to North Korea? That was the question. And recently, North Korea seems to be deescalating its threats and provocations. What seems to be behind that? You asked these two questions. In fact, North Korea is isolated at the moment, so it's hard to find anyone that could really accurately fathom the situation in North Korea. Its actions are all so very unpredictable. Hence, whether the Syrian situation would have an impact is hard to say for sure.Why is North Korea appearing to deescalate its threats and provocations? There's no knowing for sure. But what is clear and what I believe for sure is that the international community with regard to North Korea's bad behavior, its provocations, must speak with one voice, a firm message, and consistently send a firm message that they will not stand and that North Korea's actions in breach of international norms will be met with so-and-so sanctions and measures by the international community. At the same time, if it goes along the right way, there will be so-and-so reward. So if we consistently send that message to North Korea, I feel that North Korea will be left with no choice but to change.And instead of just hoping to see North Korea change, the international community must also consistently send that message with one voice to tell them and communicate to them that they have no choice but to change and to shape an environment where they are left with no choice but to make the strategic decision to change. And I think that's the effective and important way.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the NSA's data collection, can you provide a concrete example of it preventing a specific terrorist attack? And do you still believe this mass surveillance is justified? [SEP] Well, let's step back and look at the big picture. I asked a panel to review everything, and they gave me a bunch of ideas – 46, to be exact. I met with them, thanked them, and told them to really dig in and see if we're doing things the right way, balancing security with people's rights. So, we're looking at all their suggestions and will have a final answer in January. We'll say what we're doing, what needs work, and how it all fits together, both here and with other countries. The 215 program, the one with all the phone data, has gotten a lot of attention. The NSA thought it was important after 9/11 to track calls from terrorists overseas. They kept the data to help with investigations. Now, no one's saying the NSA did anything wrong with the data, but people are worried about what *could* happen. And that's what the judge was saying. So, we need to figure out if we can do the same thing in a way that makes people feel better about it. I trust the NSA, but we need to keep up with technology and make sure people trust us. We also need to think about how this looks to other countries. We have rules about spying on Americans, but not as many for other countries. But in today's world, those lines are blurry.

{"sentence": "President Bush, the situation in Pakistan appears to be shifting dramatically. Given the recent election results, do you still have confidence in President Musharraf's leadership, particularly in the context of counter-terrorism efforts? [SEP] Well, let's consider this: Is it in America's best interest to support Africa? The answer is a resounding yes, and we're certainly capable of doing both. The elections in Pakistan represent a victory for the Pakistani people, a testament to free and fair democratic processes. This is a crucial step forward in the war on terror, as these extremist ideologies cannot tolerate free societies. President Musharraf fulfilled his commitments by holding elections and lifting the state of emergency. Now, the focus shifts to the newly elected officials and their willingness to align with the United States. We view Pakistan as a vital ally with shared objectives, including combating radical elements responsible for the tragic death of Benazir Bhutto and preventing the establishment of safe havens for those plotting attacks against the U.S. and Pakistan. Regarding the alignment of American and African interests, the answer is unequivocally yes. The U.S. is a diverse nation, a melting pot of cultures and nationalities. African Americans form a significant part of our population, and it is in their interest to support U.S. assistance to Africa. Furthermore, we are interconnected in a globalized world where challenges easily transcend borders. Isolationism is not a viable strategy. Migration is inevitable, and if we fail to support Africa's youth, they will seek opportunities elsewhere, potentially creating challenges for us. Therefore, supporting Africa is an enlightened approach. The threat of terrorism knows no boundaries, as evidenced by the 9/11 attacks. We share common interests.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, after your discussions with the American President, do you feel reassured regarding the future direction of climate change and Russia policies under his successor? Are you concerned about a potential weakening of the unified European front against Russia? And in light of Mr. Trump's election, would you deem it necessary to re-announce your candidacy as a matter of formality? [SEP] Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last 8 years. And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding. So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately, it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds. If I were here and I were German and I had a vote, I might support her. With respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office. Russia is an important country. It is a military superpower. It has influence in the region, and it has influence around the world. And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation. I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing and they are having good relationships with their neighbors and participating constructively on big issues like climate change. So I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world. The values that we talked about—the values of democracy and free speech and international norms and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity—those things are not something that we can set aside. And so in—on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we've had very significant differences. And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms. And I don't expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria—that we just do whatever is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we'll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together. I am encouraged by the President-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change. And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security, I think, is very important. And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election. As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyber attacks. This isn't new. It's not unique to Russia. There are a number of states where we've seen low-level cyber attacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds. And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, although we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering will sometimes take place even if we don't like it, there's a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we're monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening. I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don't see a cyber arms race. A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn't become a lawless, low-level battlefield. And we've started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G-20, the G-7, and at the U.N. levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front. Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I'm very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it is—it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly. Because this is all about the American people, it's about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming administration. And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. And that is in our mutual interest. So we will continue this. I will continue this with—I approach this with an open mind, and I'll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. Secondly, on Russia, I can only repeat what the President said previously. This is all about respecting certain principles. And I'm saying this from a European vantage point, from a European—from a German vantage point, sorry. The fact that for over 70 years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts. But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts. This is why we launched the Normandy process, in close coordination with the United States of America. And particularly from a German perspective—from the European perspective—I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor. And just look at Poland—the sort of European perspective this has. So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one. We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share. But this mustn't keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements. And this is what I'm going to continue to work on with all my heart. So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today.", "label": "General"}

Regarding the new partnership in the Americas, I don't want to reveal all the highlights from my upcoming speech! However, what excites me most is the potential for mutual benefit. Chile, for example, has made significant strides in clean energy, leading to the establishment of a clean energy partnership. While we're making progress in alternative energy, Chile may offer valuable initiatives for the United States. In education, we have a strong history of public education and world-class universities. However, in an increasingly interconnected world, we want American students to broaden their perspectives. A broad-based exchange program with the Americas is crucial. Security cooperation is also essential to combat narcotraffickers. Colombia's success in restoring security provides valuable lessons for smaller Central American countries facing similar challenges. Collaborative training efforts involving Chile, the United States, and Colombia would be more effective than unilateral action. This partnership will be characterized by reciprocity, not just assistance to a less developed country. Chile, a rising regional power, will collaborate with us to promote peace and prosperity. We lag behind Europe in integrating the Americas. They overcame devastating wars to form the European Union. President Bush Sr.'s free trade area proposal never materialized. Latin America is ready to realize its potential. We share territory, hardworking people, and fewer conflicts. We aim to recover lost time. We have much in common: Harvard ties, sports. The First Ladies admire each other. We seek a Partnership 2.0 with shared responsibilities, not existentialism. This alliance should be comprehensive: democracy, freedom, rule of law, human rights. We must improve the OAS democratic charter. It should open doors to free trade faster and include education, science, technology, innovation. These are pillars for Latin America to overcome poverty. We can learn from the US's innovation. This alliance addresses energy, water, organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, global warming, and world security. We need a new international order beyond Bretton Woods. The time is right to end past encounters and initiate collaboration. We must face problems and seize opportunities in the knowledge society.

I've even spoken with traditionally conservative religious leaders who are deeply invested in this issue. And the business community is overwhelmingly in favor. So, we have a broad coalition of support, including many who typically lean Republican. If people are looking for a reason to avoid doing the right thing on immigration reform, they can always find one. But I believe that people ultimately want to do what's right. This would strengthen our borders, streamline the legal immigration process, hold accountable employers who exploit undocumented workers, and provide a pathway for those here illegally to come into compliance with the law – pay a penalty, learn English, and get in line. It's a common-sense solution, and we shouldn't be looking for excuses to avoid it. I'm going to keep fighting to get it done. Will I need to work to restore confidence in some of our initiatives? Absolutely. But that's part of the job. Positive developments often go unnoticed, while negative ones receive significant attention. That's the nature of the beast. I'm ready for the challenge. We're going to make it happen.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Q. My question has to do with your powers of persuasion. During the debt ceiling debate, you asked for the American public to call Members of Congress, and switchboards got jammed. You have done a similar thing while going around the country doing this. Talking to Members of Congress, there's not the same reaction; you're not seeing--hearing about phones being jammed. Talking to one Member of Congress, he told me there's a disillusionment he's concerned about with the public that maybe they just don't believe anything can get done anyway. Are you worried about your own powers of persuasion and maybe that the American public is not listening to you anymore? [SEP] Well, no. What we've seen is the American people respond very enthusiastically to the specific provisions of the jobs bill. They are very skeptical about Congress's ability to act right now, and that's understandable. The American people are very frustrated. They've been frustrated for a long time. They don't get a sense that folks in this town are looking out for their interests. They get a sense that folks in this town are thinking about their own jobs, their own careers, their own advancement, their party interests. And so if the question is, Chuck, are people feeling cynical and frustrated about the prospects of positive action in this city? Absolutely. And I can go out there and make speeches, but until they actually see action, some of that cynicism is going to be there.As you said, during the debt ceiling debate, a very solid majority, I think maybe even higher than 70 percent, agreed with the approach that I talked about, which was we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction.And what the American people saw is that Congress didn't care, not just what I thought, they didn't care about what the American people thought. They had their own agenda. And so if they see that over and over again, that cynicism is not going to be reduced until Congress actually proves their cynicism wrong by doing something that would actually help the American people. This is a great opportunity to do it. This is a great opportunity to do it.And keep in mind, if the American jobs bill passes, we're still going to have challenges. We're still going to have to make sure that we've got the best education system in the world because that is going to be critical for our long-term competitiveness and creating good, solid middle class jobs. We're still going to have to keep investing in basic research and science. We're still going to have to make sure that we do even more on infrastructure. I mean, what's contained in the American jobs bill doesn't cover all the roads and bridges and infrastructure that needs to be improved around the country.So there--so it's not as if that's going to solve all our problems, but it is an important start that we know would end up growing the economy and putting hundreds of thousands, millions of people back to work at a time when they need it the most. And it's paid for.The one persuasive argument that the Republicans previously had made against a bill like this is the deficit is growing, we can't afford it. Well, we can afford it if we're willing to ask people like me to do a little bit more in taxes. We can afford it without affecting our deficit. Our proposal is paid for. So that can't be the excuse.And so yes, until they see Congress actually putting country ahead of party politics and partisanship, they're going to be skeptical. And it doesn't matter how many times I preach to them, this is not a reflection of their lack of faith in the American jobs bill. They haven't seen Congress able to come together and act.This is a good opportunity, though.", "label": "Implicit"}

Furthermore, a year after promising to close Guantanamo, it remains open. With reports of resistance from within your administration, who is ultimately calling the shots on this issue? Will Guantanamo be closed before you leave office? [SEP] I've stated clearly that closing Guantanamo is a goal for this nation. However, progress has been hampered by the reluctance of other countries to accept detainees. To make this work, we need a place for these individuals to go. The Senate recently voted overwhelmingly against bringing these prisoners into the country. So, the practical issue is: what do we do with these people? To say nothing has been done is inaccurate. We are actively working with other nations to facilitate the return of detainees. Many of these individuals are dangerous, and countries are hesitant to accept them. We also want to ensure humane treatment upon their return. Another challenge is holding trials. I'm eager to see these trials commence. The courts are involved in determining the process, and the Defense Department is working to establish mechanisms for these trials. The sooner we can get this underway, the better. I can't predict whether Guantanamo will be closed. It's a complex issue. I've set an aspiration. Whether we achieve it remains to be seen. It's not as simple as some believe.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Back in July, your budget office's midsession review forecast that unemployment would be 7.7 percent in the second--in the fourth quarter of 2012. Will this package deal lower that projected rate? And also, is it going to do more to boost growth and create jobs than your Recovery Act? [SEP] This is not as significant a boost to the economy as the Recovery Act was, but we're in a different situation now. I mean, when the Recovery Act passed, we were looking at a potential Great Depression, and we might have seen unemployment go up to 15 percent, 20 percent. We don't know. In combination with the work we did in stabilizing the financial system, the work that the Federal Reserve did, that's behind us now. We don't have the danger of a double-dip recession.What we have is a situation in which the economy, although growing, although company profits are up, although we are seeing some job growth in the private sector, the economy is not growing fast enough to drive down the unemployment rate given the 8 million jobs that were lost before I came into office and just as I was coming into office.So what this package does is provide an additional boost that is substantially more significant than I think most economic forecasters had expected. And in fact, you've already seen some, just over the last 24 hours, suggest that we may see faster growth and more job growth as a consequence of this package. I think the payroll tax holiday will have an impact. Unemployment insurance probably has the biggest impact in terms of making sure that the recovery that we have continues and perhaps at a faster pace.So overall, every economist I've talked to suggests that this will help economic growth and this will help job growth over the next several months. And that is the main criteria by which I made this decision.Look, this is something that I think everybody has to remember, and I would speak especially to my fellow Democrats, who I think rightly are passionate about middle class families, working families, low-income families who are having the toughest time in this economy: The single most important jobs program we can put in place is a growing economy. The single most important antipoverty program we can put in place is making sure folks have jobs and the economy is growing.We can do a whole bunch of other stuff, but if the economy is not growing, if the private sector is not hiring faster than it's currently hiring, then we are going to continue to have problems no matter how many programs we put into place.And that's why, when I look at what our options were, for us to have another 3, 4, 5 months of uncertainty, not only would that have a direct impact on the people who see their paychecks get smaller, not only would that have a direct impact on people who are unemployed and literally depend on unemployment insurance to pay the bills or keep their home or keep their car, but in terms of macroeconomics, the overall health of the economy, that would have been a damaging thing.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. One follow-up on energy, sir. You also met with energy consumers about supply. What steps are you considering taking if OPEC Plus does not raise supply? And do you see any irony in pushing them to increase oil production at the same time that you're going to COP26 to urge people to lower emissions? [SEP] Well, on the surface, it seems like an irony, but the truth of the matter is—you've all known; everyone knows—that the idea we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight and not have—from this moment on, not use oil or not use gas or not use hydrogen is just not rational.Certain things we can wipe out and we don't have to do. We should be moving immediately to get rid of—as they've adopted here my proposal—to end methane, to deal with a whole range of things.But it does, on the surface, seem inconsistent, but it's not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we'd be in a position—or even next year—that we're not going to use any more oil or gas; that we're not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We're going to be making significant changes.And it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy: to wind and solar and other means of energy.But the idea that we're just going to end and somehow—but it does, on the surface, I admit to you. We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, and I'm saying, Why are you guys cutting off oil and raising the price just to make it look harder for us? But it's a legitimate question.I think, though, that if anybody thinks about it, no one ever thought that tomorrow—for example, it's going to take us between now and 2030 to have half the vehicles in America electric vehicles.

Can you avoid a—what would appear to be something of a diplomatic train wreck when you meet with President Putin? [SEP] I mean, look, I'm going to meet with President Putin to make it clear to him the cold war is over and Russia is not our enemy and that there's common ground. Obviously, I've had my disagreements with the President in the past, and— but there's also areas where we need to work in common, such as proliferation and dealing with terror. And I've got some convincing to do, but he needs to understand, the missile defense system is aimed at— aimed primarily at rogue regimes coming out of the Middle East that could hold us all hostage. And this is a good—it's a good chance for me to sit down and have yet another heart-to-heart with him. And I'm more than happy to do so.I made it clear yesterday that NATO needs to look at expansion in our interests, not—and not give any nation a veto power over whether or not NATO ought to extend MAP membership and/or membership. And so it's—you know, I understand Russian concerns about the expanse of NATO. They were concerned when Romania got into NATO, I'm confident. But look what a great partner and a peaceful neighbor Romania is. I mean, Romania has no warlike aspirations. These are people who want to help other democracies thrive and, at the same time, see their economy grow. I've explained to President Putin: Democracies on the border of Russia are in their interest.And so this is a good opportunity. I don't mind a good, frank discussion with President Putin. He doesn't mind telling me what's on his mind either. We've had 7 years working together, a chance to have some pretty candid exchanges. And secondly—and this is his last—this will be our last face-to-face meeting as his Presidency. And I'll thank him. I'll thank him for being candid with me. I'll thank him for serving his nation. I have no animosity toward President Putin. Just because you don't agree on issues doesn't mean you can't find a cordiality, to be able to discuss things in a frank manner, and that's the way our relationship has been. We—I met with him a lot in the course of my Presidency, and I appreciate the fact that he invited me to Sochi.And so I have no—I'm not going to set any kind of expectations. I guess you are. You call it a diplomatic train wreck; I call it an opportunity to sit down and have a good, frank discussion again. And we'll see what happens, what comes out of it. It's a good opportunity for me to say goodbye and to see whether or not we can sign the strategic dialogue that will serve our nations' interest after his Presidency and mine. From our point of view—and I would like to make a comment here that does not necessarily answer your question—but Romania has a relatively simple approach in relation to its ties with Russia. Firstly, we have to admit that all— we all, and particularly the former Communist states, must equally and perhaps more—to a larger extent, Russia, we all have to overcome the logics of the cold war, because at present, there is nothing to justify this approach, this logic. Each independent state is free to have its options, and nobody can have the right—the veto right upon the options of an independent state.But apart from this statement that regards more the principles, I would like to point out—to refer to some issues that from our point of view are threats. For example, terrorist is a threat equally for Russia, for America, for Spain, and it can materialize at any time against Ukraine, against Georgia. So I would like to—I could say that in this point, in this respect, we are all at the same level of risk.The trafficking in arms is an equal threat for the Russian Federation, for the United States, for Romania, for Ukraine, for Georgia, for Albania as well. This is another issue that we have to fight against together. The trafficking in narcotics that transforms into money for arms and into generations of youth that are deeply affected—this threat affects equally the Russian Federation, Romania, America, France, Germany. Trafficking in human beings is another risk that affects equally Russia, America, Ukraine, Romania. And a possible cyber attack can be deployed with an equal risk for Russia, for Romania, for America. Missile attacks that are deployed by countries that do not respect the rules, that are not part of the proliferation treaties—this risk can affect, at any time, the Russian Federation, America, Romania, Ukraine.Seeing—finding that the risks are the same, are almost similar for everybody, why can't we find a common ground for solidarity between us, among us—NATO member states, Russia Federation, aspiring NATO states—a common ground for generating the same policy? Actually, the only thing that hinders us from acting united against the risks that affect us equally is the fact that some of us are still attached to the logics, to the approach of the cold war, and do not have an equal respect for the democratic rights of the peoples.", "label": "Implicit"}

I've always supported comprehensive reform. I campaigned on it. I understand the concerns about illegal immigration, which is why we've been working to secure the border. We're doubling the Border Patrol, building fences, and using new technology. I even sent the National Guard down there for a while. This bill addresses those concerns. It sets benchmarks for border security before any other reforms take place. But you can't have real border security without a temporary worker program. People will come here to work, and they'll find a way. That creates an underground industry of smugglers and document forgers. It's inhumane. We need to give people a legal way to come here and work temporarily. And we need a tamper-proof ID card to verify employment. The hardest part is what to do with the people who are already here. Some people want to deport them all, but that's not realistic. And we can't just give them automatic citizenship. So we've developed a plan where they have to meet certain requirements to get a Z visa, like background checks and fines. They go to the back of the line for citizenship. If you support the bill, I appreciate it. If you don't, you can always find something to criticize. It's easy to pick it apart. But I believe it's the right thing to do. I want to get it done because it will solve the problem. I want to take it out of politics. Immigration debates can bring out the worst in people. We're a nation of immigrants. I was moved by the story of the Coast Guard ensign whose grandfather came from Mexico. He's serving America with pride. That's what immigration can mean for America. Welcoming people who want to work and pursue the American Dream renews our spirit. We have an opportunity to pass a good law now. It will be difficult, and politics will play a role. But I hope members of Congress will rise above it. I will.", "label": "Implicit"}

[SEP] It is—it may take slight—slightly longer than—worldwide. But the United States is going to continue—I think there's a possibility, over 2022 going into 2023, that we would be able to be in a position to provide another billion—us. But that's not done yet.I only—I've been very careful, as I've dealt with this pandemic, to tell you what I know and say what I thought could be done, and when I've announced that I've gone and done it. What I don't want to do is be getting too far ahead in suggesting that we can do things and I can do things—the United States can do things that I don't have done yet.So I—there was a clear consensus among all our colleagues at the G-7 that this wasn't the end; we were going to stay at it until we're able to provide for—able to provide for—the needs of the whole world, in terms—because, look, it's not just the right thing to do. And from a—how can I say it?—from a moral standpoint. But it is also the correct thing to do, in terms of our own health, our own security. You can't build a wall high enough to keep out new strains. You can't do that.And so I think this is going to be a constant project for a long time. And there may be other pandemics.

I mean, they understood it—knew it from trying it themselves. This is a gigantic logistical effort. It's one thing to send nation X, X number—Y number of vaccines. It's another thing to have the people that can actually get it in somebody's arm. And so we are also providing the ability for other countries to manufacture their vaccines. We've all agreed on that.India has the capacity to do that. They don't have the material capacity thus far to do the manufacturing. But there's a lot going on to provide—not only to, quote, give vaccines, but to provide the ability of the countries in question to produce their own vaccines. Last question. Last question.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said more than once that you did not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?And if I can do a compound question, the other one is, you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition, but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments, either expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I'm talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the White nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under a President Trump as his chief strategist and senior adviser. What message does that send to the country, to the world? [SEP] Okay. Athena, without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates.When I won, there were a number of people who didn't like me and didn't like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don't know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference.So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him and Members of Congress and reaching out to constituencies that didn't vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don't think any President ever comes in saying to himself, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.But it's only been 6 days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites, but don't always translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with.I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.", "label": "Dodging"}

With a Republican Congress, you failed to achieve three major goals of your second term: Social Security reform, a Tax Code overhaul, and a comprehensive immigration bill.

[SEP] That's a tricky little question there. [] First, I haven't given up on any of those issues. I've got 2 years left to achieve them. And I firmly believe it is more likely to achieve those three objectives with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican-controlled Senate. And I believe I'll be working with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican-controlled Senate.I understand here in Washington, people have already determined the outcome of the election, like it's over even before the people actually start heading—voting.

Inflation in the U.S. is at a 13-year high.So when specifically should Americans expect those prices to come down? [SEP] Well, look, first of all, the significant reason why prices are up is because of COVID affecting the supply chain. I mean, I know you—I'm not trying to be instructive; I know you know this. Number one.Number two, if you take a look at, you know, gas prices and you take a look at oil prices, that is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil. And we'll see what happens on that score sooner than later.Number three, I think if you take a look at what we're talking about—you look to this coming Thanksgiving—you know, we're in a situation where we find that we are in a very different circumstance.Last Thanksgiving, you know, I—as I said, this year, we're working on the supply chain issue. But last Thanksgiving, I sat down with my wife, my daughter, and my son-in-law. This Thanksgiving, we're all in a very different circumstance. Things are a hell of a lot better, and the wages have gone up higher—faster than inflation. And we have generated real economic growth.It doesn't mean these dislocations aren't real. They do affect people's lives. For example, one of the reasons why I decided to talk about the need to deal with the operation and the gouging that occurs in some of the pricing of beef and chicken and other things is that that's why I think we're-—that's why I indicated to you we're going to look at whether or not there's a violation of antitrust laws and what they're doing.So there's a lot to look at.

I know Americans are concerned about whether or not their neighbor may stay in their house. And so we're dealing with these issues.On the housing front, I made it clear we're not going to bail out lenders, and we're not going to help speculators. But we will help creditworthy people stay in their homes. And that's what Secretary Paulson has done, along with Secretary Jackson, in putting together what's called the HOPE NOW coalition, which has got lenders and financiers and consumer advocates all working together to develop standards to make it more likely a creditworthy person can refinance their home.See, the difficulty we face in the housing market is that the lender, the person who actually made the note, oftentimes doesn't end up owning the note. That note could be—in the recent past has been bundled and sold as an asset. And so there's no telling who owns the mortgage of the person who wants to renegotiate.

While some in Congress question our initial involvement, the recent testimony from David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker seems to have shifted the debate. I hope we can continue to find common ground by ensuring our troops are adequately funded. We also found common ground on FISA. I believe the existing law is effective for national security, which is what the American people want. It allows our intelligence professionals to understand Al Qaida's intentions.

It's difficult to find common ground when important bills aren't even being considered. Not a single appropriations bill has reached my desk.

[SEP] Our shared goal is clear: North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons and become a responsible member of the international community. This is essential for peace on the Korean Peninsula and the world, and it also benefits North Korea's own development. To encourage this change, we must work together. China's influence is significant, so their participation is crucial. China and Russia, along with the international community, share the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are cooperating to guide North Korea. China has actively participated in adopting and implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea's missile fire and nuclear testing. Russia is also firmly committed to denuclearization and has actively supported U.N. Security Council resolutions. They've also worked hard to include a stern message to North Korea in the G-8 Foreign Ministers meeting's joint statement. These efforts are vital to sending a unified message that their nuclear weapons are unacceptable and urging North Korea to make the right decision.

If North Korea's current path hasn't led to a strong, prosperous nation, now is the time for Kim Jong Un to re-evaluate and change course. If he chooses a different path, the international community would welcome it. China, Russia, Japan, and other key players in the six-party talks have made this clear. But there must be changes in behavior. Actions speak louder than words, and so far, we haven't seen actions indicating a willingness to move in a different direction.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. ——who get infected. But when you're talking about the scope of this virus, when you look at the percentage of the population that's died, there's only three countries that have more deaths than the U.S. So how do you explain that: that—why the percentage of the population who has died is so much higher in the U.S.? The President. Well, I think, actually, the numbers are lower than others. I'll get back to you on that. But we, proportionately, are lower than almost all countries. We're at the bottom of the list.And we're—relative to cases, also, we're at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing, being at the bottom of the list. But I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we're, generally speaking, at the very bottom of the list. So I'll get back to you. Q. Because when I—when I look at the Johns Hopkins, you know, Coronavirus Resource Center on their website, it says the most affected countries, when you look at deaths per 100,000 people of the population—so how many people in the population have died—you have the U.K., Peru, Chile, and then the U.S.You know, Canada has 8,000, 9,000 deaths. Obviously, they're smaller than us, but that's only 6 percent of the population—you know, that's 6 percent of our total cases. So why are the deaths so much higher in the U.S.? [SEP] Well, a lot of our numbers were based on the—New York had a very tough time, as you know. New York, New Jersey—that area. And when you take them out—just as an example, take a look at Florida, relative to New York.That's not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together. It's crowded. It's not easy.But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in—I will get back to you, but we have among the lowest numbers.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, your stance on the Pope's potential recognition of a Palestinian state and its implications for a two-state solution would be greatly appreciated. [SEP] Well, let me tell you, folks, the Senate, they're doing a tremendous job with trade. We're talking about deals that are smart, progressive, and really boost growth, not just in Asia-Pacific, but maybe even in Europe. And I'm getting the tools to enforce these deals, which is something that hasn't always happened, believe me. So, a big thank you to the Senators who voted to get this thing moving. For those who didn't, I'm not giving up, not even a little bit. I'll keep showing them why this is the right move, not just for the big guys, but for the small and medium businesses too. And most importantly, it's for the American worker, the forgotten man and woman. I wouldn't back any deal that doesn't create jobs and give Americans a real shot at success, higher incomes, and higher wages. That's my number one priority, always has been. Now, about Elizabeth, it's nothing personal, folks. The press, they love to make a big deal out of it when allies disagree on policy. But I've got friends, great friends, in the Senate and House, even early supporters, who don't see eye-to-eye with me on this. And I get it, I really do. They've seen plants close, jobs go overseas, just like me. They worry about enforcing labor and environmental agreements. They want fair trade, not just free trade. They're concerned about inequality, automation, and globalization, which have helped those at the very, very top while middle-class families, great families, struggle. These are people who share my values, tremendous values. They even put out a progressive statement of principles that was basically my agenda, except for trade. It's a policy difference, a disagreement on what's best for our people, the American people. I believe we're better off writing strong rules, the best rules, with teeth on things like child labor, deforestation, and intellectual property. We need to write those rules for the biggest, fastest-growing market in the world. If we don't, China will, and our businesses and workers will suffer, believe me. As for outsourcing fears, companies looking for cheap labor can already do it, they're already doing it. This deal gives us a chance to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., back where it belongs. Nike's bringing back jobs because of new technologies, great technologies. But we need to be able to sell over there to make the most of it, to really win. That's why I'm arguing with my progressive friends. We need to focus on things we agree on: minimum wage, job training, infrastructure, collective bargaining, overtime pay, paid sick leave, and honest budgets. These are the things that will address their concerns. Blocking this trade deal won't, especially since they admit the current rules are bad for U.S. workers. How does sticking with the status quo help? It doesn't make any sense, folks, none at all. I support enforcement and the signed provisions. I have concerns about the currency language, but I need to talk to Senator Schumer and Sherrod Brown about how to fix it without hurting our monetary policy.

As Mike Hayden, then head of the NSA, told the Iraq Study Group, the initial strategy wasn't working, and we needed a change of direction. But he also cautioned against simply abandoning the Iraqis, as their government wasn't ready to take full responsibility.

And to President Karzai, given the persistent issues of corruption and governance, how do you respond to critics who question the effectiveness of international aid, and are you fully committed to a peaceful transfer of power following the upcoming elections? [SEP] The reason we went into Afghanistan was simple: to dismantle Al Qaeda after they attacked us on 9/11. That was our primary goal, and we've largely achieved it. We've decimated their leadership, disrupted their operations, and made it much harder for them to launch attacks against us. Our men and women in uniform deserve immense credit for that. Now, did we solve all of Afghanistan's problems? No. Nation-building is a long and complex process. But we created the conditions for a more stable and secure Afghanistan, one that is less likely to be a haven for terrorists. We established a relationship with a responsible Afghan government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States? We have achieved that goal. We are in the process of achieving that goal. And for that, I think we have to thank our extraordinary military, intelligence, and diplomatic teams, as well as the cooperation of the Afghan Government and the Afghan people. On the issue of corruption, it's a serious problem, and we're working with the Afghan government to address it. It's not just a matter of money; it's a matter of governance and accountability. We need to ensure that international aid is used effectively and that the Afghan people benefit from it. And on the elections, I am committed to a peaceful and democratic transition of power.

This week, your Government delayed the environmental assessment to reroute Enbridge Line 5, and at the same time, you're approving oil drilling in Alaska.So what's your response to people who say it's hypocritical to stymie Canadian energy projects while allowing your own? [SEP] First of all, I don't think it is, but I'll be very brief.The difficult decision was on what we do with the Willow Project in Alaska, and my strong inclination was to disapprove of it across the board. But the advice I got from counsel was that if that were the case, we may very well lose in court—lose that case in court to the oil company—and then not be able to do what I really want to do beyond that, and that is, conserve significant amounts of Alaskan sea and land forever.I was able to see to it that we are literally able to conserve millions of acres—not a few—millions of acres of sea and land forever so it cannot be used in the future.I am banking on—we'll find out—that the oil company is going to say not—that's not going to be challenged, and they're going to go with three sites. And the energy that is going to be produced they're estimating would account to 1 percent—1 percent—of the total production of oil in the world.And so I thought it was a good—a—the better gamble and a hell of a tradeoff to have the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea and so many other places off limits forever now.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering your budget office's prior estimate of 7.7% unemployment by the close of 2012, do you foresee this new initiative leading to a reduction in that figure? Moreover, do you believe it will be more effective than the Recovery Act in terms of fostering economic expansion and generating employment opportunities? [SEP] This package is not of the same magnitude as the Recovery Act, but the circumstances are different. The Recovery Act was enacted during a period of potential economic collapse, with projections of unemployment reaching as high as 15 or 20 percent. That crisis has been averted due to our efforts to stabilize the financial system and the actions of the Federal Reserve. We are no longer facing the threat of a double-dip recession. However, while the economy is growing, company profits are increasing, and the private sector is experiencing some job growth, the pace is insufficient to significantly reduce the unemployment rate, given the 8 million jobs lost prior to and during my administration. This package provides a supplementary stimulus that is more substantial than most economic forecasters anticipated. Indeed, some are already suggesting that we may witness accelerated growth and increased job creation as a result. The payroll tax holiday will have a positive impact, and unemployment insurance is particularly effective in ensuring the continuation and potential acceleration of the recovery. Overall, economists concur that this will contribute to economic growth and job creation in the coming months. This was the primary consideration in my decision-making process. It is crucial to remember, particularly for my fellow Democrats who are deeply committed to middle-class, working-class, and low-income families facing the greatest challenges in this economy, that the most effective jobs program is a growing economy. The most effective anti-poverty program is ensuring that individuals have employment and the economy is expanding. While other measures can be taken, if the economy is not growing and the private sector is not hiring at a faster rate, we will continue to face difficulties, regardless of the number of programs implemented. Therefore, in evaluating our options, I concluded that prolonging the uncertainty for an additional 3, 4, or 5 months would not only directly affect individuals whose paychecks are reduced and those who rely on unemployment insurance to cover their expenses, but would also have a detrimental impact on the overall macroeconomic health of the economy.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Aside from the stimulus checks, what specific measures will alleviate the economic distress of struggling citizens? [SEP] Look, the key is certainty. Permanent tax cuts are a must. People are already facing uncertainty with rising gas prices, potentially hitting four dollars. Making the tax cuts permanent removes one major unknown. Furthermore, our energy policy needs a serious overhaul. While renewables are important, we must increase domestic oil and gas production. It's been too long since we built a new refinery. I even proposed using old military bases, but Congress rejected it. Basic economics dictate that reduced supply and steady demand lead to higher prices. Taxing oil companies is counterproductive; we should incentivize domestic investment.

The commitment must involve discussions about denuclearization and de-escalation. My Secretary of State and others would negotiate an outline for how we would proceed.

Everyone wants a better deal. But I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing for America and the world. This is the fastest-growing region, a huge market for us. They sell to us with low tariffs, but ours are higher there. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods. It also addresses labor and environmental concerns, things people have worried about in the past. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will hurt us. We'll be better off. As for currency manipulation, we have provisions to monitor it, but binding countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Fed, which we won't do. On Mansur, he targeted U.S. personnel.

Let's focus on the United States. I do think that as part of the NPT, our obligation as the largest nuclear power is to take steps to reduce our nuclear stockpile. That's what the START Treaty was about. As for Israel, I'm not going to comment on their program. I'm going to point out that we have consistently urged all countries to become members of the NPT. So there's no contradiction there. We think it is important that we have an international approach that is universal and that rests on three pillars: that those of us who have nuclear weapons are making serious efforts to reduce those stockpiles; that we are all working against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons make the decision not to pursue nuclear weapons; and that all countries have access to peaceful nuclear energy.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with no concrete evidence of an impending threat, are you comfortable with your Homeland Security Secretary's 'gut feeling' about a potential summer attack? What does your own intuition tell you? [SEP] Well, my gut, aligned with my advisors, tells me that when we identify a legitimate threat, we'll inform the public to ensure homeland security. Al-Qaeda remains a significant threat, demanding robust intelligence and response capabilities. We must not embolden them through failures in theaters of war. We must relentlessly pursue them and bring them to justice before they strike us again. This is an enduring challenge, an ideological conflict with competing visions for the world. What sets this apart is the asymmetrical use of power – IEDs and suicide bombers as tools to achieve strategic goals. Their aim is to impose their vision, expel the U.S. from key regions, and establish safe havens where women are oppressed, mirroring the Taliban's Afghanistan. It is our duty to defend ourselves by remaining on the offensive and promoting an alternative ideology. Throughout our history, we've assisted others in realizing the blessings of liberty, even former adversaries, understanding freedom's power to foster peace. As we navigate this ideological battle in the 21st century, we must remember that liberty can transform societies. The debate centers on whether nations like Iraq can self-govern and whether their people value liberty. I firmly believe freedom is a universal value, not exclusive to Americans. The 2005 elections demonstrated this, defying threats and violence. Iraq is just one front in the broader war against jihadists and extremists. This struggle will persist, much like past ideological conflicts. I believe democracy will continue to spread throughout the Middle East if the U.S. remains engaged. That's why I'm committed to diplomatic involvement in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will visit in early August to reaffirm our strategic partnerships and encourage the pursuit of freer societies, supporting the Iraqi government's survival. Achieving this is vital, and we must succeed to fulfill our duty. This is demanding work. The question is whether we persevere or retreat, allowing polls to dictate the country's fate. Retreat would necessitate future intervention with greater force to protect ourselves, as events overseas directly impact our security.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "President Park, concerning the denuclearization of North Korea, you highlighted the significance of international cooperation. Could you detail your discussions with President Obama on this topic, and what are your views on the contributions of Russia and China? President Obama, what are your thoughts on Kim Jong Un, and what message would you impart to him today? [SEP] Regarding North Korea, our collective aim, alongside the international community, is denuclearization and their integration as a responsible actor on the world stage. This fosters peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, while also benefiting North Korea's own advancement. To facilitate this, we must collaborate effectively. China's influence is substantial, rendering their participation indispensable. We addressed this matter. China and Russia, in concert with the international community, share the objective of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are cooperating to guide North Korea. China has actively engaged in adopting and implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining to North Korea's missile launches and nuclear tests. Russia is also committed to denuclearization and has actively supported U.N. resolutions. They also contributed to incorporating a strong message to North Korea in the G-8 Foreign Ministers' meeting statement. These concerted efforts are vital in conveying a unified message that their nuclear weapons are unacceptable and urging them to make the correct decision. I lack personal acquaintance with Kim Jong Un and cannot offer commentary on his character. However, his actions have been provocative and ultimately self-defeating. We will maintain a robust deterrent and refrain from rewarding provocative conduct. Nevertheless, we remain open to North Korea pursuing denuclearization, adhering to international commitments, reintegrating into the international community, and achieving security and prosperity for its populace. If North Korea's current trajectory has failed to yield a strong, prosperous nation, Kim Jong Un should consider a change of course. Should he do so, we and the global community would welcome it. China, Russia, Japan, and other participants in the six-party talks have articulated this clearly. However, a shift in behavior is imperative. As the adage goes, 'Actions speak louder than words.' Thus far, North Korea has not demonstrated a willingness to alter its course.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Regarding the ongoing investigation, can you share any details about its location or express your confidence in its outcome? [SEP] Look, I'm deliberately keeping my distance from that. As the nation's chief law enforcement officer, I could insert myself, but I believe it's best to let the Attorney General handle it. He's got Durham, a highly respected individual, leading the charge. We'll see what they uncover. I'm not going to speculate at this point.", "label": "Declining to answer"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering your statements about the necessity of addressing both Afghanistan and Pakistan, why has Pakistan's contribution to resolving the conflict been largely overlooked at this summit? Did your conversations with President Zardari result in any advancement regarding the reopening of supply routes? And if the broader issues with Pakistan are not resolved, will NATO's achievements in Afghanistan be at risk? [SEP] Well, my discussion with President Zardari was brief, but I reiterated our public and private stance: Pakistan is part of the solution in Afghanistan. A democratic, prosperous, and stable Pakistan is in our national interest. We share a common enemy in extremists in both countries, and we must address the tensions arising from our decade-long military presence. President Zardari believes these issues can be resolved. We didn't expect the supply line issue to be resolved here, but we're making progress. Everyone in the alliance and Afghanistan understands that security, stability, and prosperity require resolving these issues and joining the international community to prevent extremism. There are real challenges and tensions between ISAF, the US, and Pakistan, but they are being addressed through military and diplomatic channels. Ultimately, a successful, stable Pakistan is in our interest, and it's in Pakistan's interest to work with us to prevent extremism. We're committed to this, and every NATO/ISAF member is too.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, what distinctions do you see between the current situation in Iraq and a full-blown civil war? And are you concerned that labeling it as a civil war would undermine the argument that we're fighting the central front of the war on terror there? [SEP] The reality is that Zarqawi's strategy was to instigate sectarian violence. The Samarra bombing last winter was a clear attempt to fuel that violence, and unfortunately, it succeeded. The recent bombings are a continuation of that effort. So, we've been dealing with this phase for some time now. Our primary goal is to collaborate with the Iraqis to create an environment where the majority of the population can see a peaceful path forward. The recent bombings are part of a pattern that has persisted for about nine months. I plan to discuss this issue with Prime Minister Maliki when I meet him in Jordan on Thursday. I will ask him directly: What do we need to do to achieve success? What is your strategy for addressing the sectarian violence? I will assure him of our continued commitment to pursuing Al Qaeda and preventing them from establishing a safe haven in Iraq. I will also inquire about what is required and what his strategy is for Iraq to become a self-governing and self-sustaining nation. This will be an important meeting, and I am looking forward to it.", "label": "Dodging"}
{"sentence": "Given the recent declaration from North Korea regarding their nuclear programs, which notably omits any mention of existing nuclear weapons, does the White House consider this declaration satisfactory? Furthermore, following the decision to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, what leverage remains for the United States to ensure progress on the abduction issue, a matter of grave concern to Japan? [SEP] Let's be clear: North Korea remains under the heaviest sanctions of any nation globally, and that will not change. The only path to lifting those sanctions is through verifiable adherence to their commitments. The idea that delisting somehow nullifies these sanctions is simply inaccurate. We are operating on an action-for-action basis. The destruction of the cooling tower was a verifiable step forward, a positive sign. However, we have other serious concerns, including the abduction issue. Progress on the nuclear front cannot come at the expense of addressing these other critical issues. We need good-faith negotiations to achieve progress on all fronts, for the benefit of Japan and for North Korea itself.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Sir, with June marking the deadliest month for American soldiers in Afghanistan since the war's onset, is Afghanistan now the main battleground in the war on terror, eclipsing Iraq? Are Al Qaeda and the Taliban gaining ground? And is there a possibility of deploying more U.S. troops sooner than the previously stated 2009 timeframe? [SEP] Look, any time we lose a soldier, anywhere, it's heartbreaking, and our thoughts are with their families. We're incredibly thankful for the Americans who step up and risk their lives. Now, June was tough in Afghanistan, but it was also tough for the Taliban. One reason we've seen more deaths is because our troops are taking the fight to a tough enemy. They don't want us there because they don't want America denying them a safe place to hide. We're pushing an idea that's the opposite of theirs, so of course there's going to be resistance. I'm confident our strategy will work, which is to take on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, while also encouraging a free society through good economic policies, education, and healthcare. We're always looking at troop needs and numbers. We're halfway through 2008, and like I said, we're adding troops by 2009. But you've got to remember, we've doubled Afghan troops, and coalition troops have also doubled in the last couple of years. So, there's a strong presence, and there are more troops there than before. But we're constantly reassessing and seeing if we can tweak our tactics to get the job done.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the Washington Post's report about the FBI building and its inclusion in the GOP coronavirus bill, could you clarify the White House's stance on this matter? [SEP] Well, I'm not entirely sure it's being included in *this* particular bill, but the need for a new FBI building is undeniable. The current one is frankly, falling apart – a real safety hazard with panels and concrete bits detaching. They've considered sites far from D.C., but I've emphasized the importance of proximity to the Justice Department. The existing site is ideal, despite other locations in Maryland and Virginia being considered. I've been a strong advocate for its construction. We have a choice: renovate a substandard building or build a state-of-the-art facility for the next century, complete with amenities like rooftop tracks for our hardworking FBI personnel. A new building is the superior, long-term solution. Whether it's in this bill or another, the FBI will get its new headquarters. We'll make sure of it. Thank you all.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

What concessions are you willing to make to secure their support, and how will you ensure progressives remain on board? [SEP] Look, negotiations are ongoing.

Will the U.S. apologize for its role in the difficult years of the seventies in Chile? [SEP] We will consider any requests from Chile for information about the past and would like to cooperate. It's important to know our history, and U.S.-Latin America relations have been rocky at times. However, we can't be trapped by our history. Chile has made extraordinary progress in the last two decades, supported by the U.S. I can't speak to all past policies, but I can speak to the present and future. The U.S. strongly supports democracy, eradicating poverty, broad-based development, and open markets in Chile.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, beyond generalities, can you share specific details about the 'evaluation' of Israeli-Palestinian relations? What concrete steps will the U.S. take to encourage progress towards a two-state solution, and what consequences will Israel face if it continues to obstruct such efforts? [SEP] As a rule, I don't comment on intelligence matters in a big room full of reporters. We have briefed Congress and our partners about the progress or lack thereof. If an agreement is arrived at that we feel confident will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, it's going to be there for everybody to see. I have confidence that if there's an agreement, it's going to be a good agreement that's good for American security and Israeli security and the region's security. With respect to Israel's relations with the Palestinians, I think it's important to understand that the issue here is not what I believe, but it's what the Palestinians and the parties in the negotiations and the Israeli people believe is possible. That's the most important issue.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, do you believe China's economic slowdown could destabilize the global economy or lead to increased aggression, particularly towards Taiwan? Separately, are you concerned about the meeting between President Putin and Kim Jong Un and its potential impact on the war in Ukraine? [SEP] China faces significant economic challenges due to international factors and its own policies. I don't believe this will lead to an invasion of Taiwan; in fact, their capacity may be diminished. We are not seeking to harm China; a prosperous China operating within international rules benefits everyone. However, they've encountered economic difficulties, particularly in real estate. The actions they take are currently under consideration, and I won't predict the outcome. We are not decoupling from China. However, I will not provide China with materials that enhance their nuclear weapons capabilities or defense activities that are contrary to positive regional developments.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Arigato, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, in regards to the Senkaku Islands, I just want to make sure that this is absolutely clear. Are you saying that the U.S. would consider using military force were China to have some sort of military incursion in those islands to protect those islands? And how does that not draw another red line that you would have to enforce, putting U.S. credibility, your credibility on the line once again, as it was in the case with Syria and Russia? And on another key security issue, you mentioned North Korea in your meeting with the Prime Minister. Are you issuing a warning to North Korea that there should not be another nuclear test?And to Prime Minister Abe, do you have confidence in President Obama's assurances about your security when the U.S. and the West were unable to stop Russia's advances in Ukraine? Thank you. President Obama. Well, Jim, let me unpack that question because there's a whole bunch of assumptions in there, some of which I don't agree with.First of all, the treaty between the United States and Japan preceded my birth, so obviously, this isn't a red line that I'm drawing, it is the standard interpretation over multiple administrations of the terms of the alliance, which is that territories under the administration of Japan are covered under the treaty. There's no shift in position. There's no red line that's been drawn. We're simply applying the treaty.At the same time, as I've said directly to the Prime Minister: that it would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China. And we are going to do everything we can to encourage that diplomatically.With respect to the other issues that you raise, our position, Jim—the United States position—is that countries should abide by international law; that those laws, those rules, those norms are violated when you gas children or when you invade the territory of another country. Now, the implication of the question, I think, is, is that each and every time a country violates one of those norms, the United States should go to war or stand prepared to engage militarily, and if it doesn't, then somehow we're not serious about those norms. Well, that's not the case.Right now we have 87 percent of Syria's chemical weapons have already been removed from Syria. There's about 13 percent left. That's as a consequence of U.S. leadership. And the fact that we didn't have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms, it's a success. It's not a complete success until we have the last 13 percent out.With respect to Russia and Ukraine, we've been very clear about the fact that there's not going to be a military solution to the problem in Ukraine, but we have already applied sanctions that have had an impact on the Russian economy, and we have continued to hold out the prospect—the possibility—to resolve this issue diplomatically. There was some possibility that Russia could take the wiser course after the meetings in Geneva. So far at least, we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva. And instead, we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, and destabilizing the region, and we haven't seen Russia step up and discourage that.On the other side, you've seen the Government in Kiev take very concrete steps, in introducing an amnesty law and offering a whole range of reforms with respect to the Constitution, that are consistent with what was discussed in Geneva. And my expectation is, is that if, once again, Russia fails to abide by both the spirit and the letter of what was discussed in Geneva, that there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions.That doesn't mean that the problem is going to be solved right away. These are difficult issues. But what we try to do is to make sure that we are very clear about what we stand for, what we believe in, and we are willing to take actions on behalf of those values, those norms, and those ideals.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, the intelligence community has assessed that Russia is actively interfering in the upcoming election to undermine Joe Biden, and China is considering similar actions against you. Do you accept these findings, and if so, what measures will you take to safeguard the integrity of the election? [SEP] Look, the last thing Putin wants is me back in the Oval Office. Nobody has been tougher on Russia. So, if they're meddling, it's probably because they know I'll hold them accountable. We'll see what happens.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

Why haven't you implemented a more unified and consistent communication strategy to address the confusion and restore public trust?

The scientific community is learning new things every day, and that inevitably leads to some changes in recommendations. As for the CDC, they're working hard to provide the best possible guidance. It's not always easy to communicate complex scientific information in a clear and concise manner. But we're committed to improving our communication efforts.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, to be perfectly clear, regarding the Senkaku Islands, if China were to engage in military aggression, would the United States commit military force to defend them? Some perceive this as another 'red line' scenario, potentially damaging U.S. credibility, akin to the situation in Syria. Furthermore, concerning North Korea, are you explicitly warning them against conducting further nuclear tests? And Prime Minister Abe, considering the perceived lack of Western action in Ukraine, do you maintain complete confidence in President Obama's assurances regarding your nation's security? [SEP] Alright, let's unpack that a bit. First, the treaty with Japan isn't some new policy I'm creating. It's been the standard interpretation across multiple administrations that territories under Japanese administration are covered by the treaty. So, there's no 'red line' being drawn here. We're simply applying the existing agreement. However, I've made it clear to Prime Minister Abe that escalating this issue is not the answer. We need dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China, and we'll be actively working to encourage that diplomatically. Now, regarding international law, the United States believes that countries should abide by it. When you gas children or invade another country, you're violating those laws. But that doesn't mean we need to go to war every single time. We've already removed 87% of Syria's chemical weapons through U.S. leadership, without firing a missile. That's a success, not a failure. As for Russia and Ukraine, a military solution isn't going to work. We've already imposed sanctions that are impacting the Russian economy, and we're still pursuing a diplomatic resolution. Russia initially seemed willing to cooperate after the Geneva meetings, but they haven't followed through. Meanwhile, Kiev is taking concrete steps with reforms. If Russia continues to disregard the agreement, there will be further consequences and sanctions. These are difficult issues, but we're committed to our values and are willing to act on them.
