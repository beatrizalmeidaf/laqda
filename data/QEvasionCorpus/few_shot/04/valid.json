{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the economic package that you rolled out earlier this week, first on the business tax cuts. Why did you wait until this superheated campaign season to roll it out? A lot of your critics and even some Democrats say, well, clearly he's just using this for political purposes, he doesn't have any expectation it's actually going to be passed, it's a political weapon. Why did you wait so long to bring that out?And on the stimulus part, we can't get people in the White House to say it is a stimulus--$50 billion for roads and other infrastructure, but they avoid the word stimulus like the plague. Is that because the original stimulus is so deeply unpopular? And if so, why is it so unpopular? [SEP] Well, let me go back to when I first came into office. We had an immediate task, which was to rescue an economy that was tipping over a cliff. And we put in place an economic plan that 95 percent of economists say substantially helped us avoid a depression.A third of those were tax cuts, by the way. A third of that economic plan was tax cuts for individuals and for small businesses. So we haven't--this notion that we waited until now to put forward a series of plans, Chip, we've--just on the small-business issue alone, we have cut taxes for small businesses eight times during the course of the last 18 months. So we're hardly Johnny-come-latelies on this issue.Now, when you put all the things we've done together, it has made a difference. Three million people have jobs that wouldn't have them otherwise had we not taken these steps. The economy would be in much worse shape. But as I said before, we're not where we need to go yet, which means that if we're not there yet, what else can we do?And the proposals that we've put forward are ones that historically, again, have garnered bipartisan support: a research and development tax credit so that companies that are investing in research here in the United States, which is part of what's going to keep us growing and keep us innovative, let's make sure that companies are strongly incentivized to do that; making sure that their expensing accelerated business depreciation is happening in 2011 so that if companies are sort of sitting on the sidelines right now, not sure whether they should invest, let's give them incentive to go ahead and invest now to give that a jumpstart.On infrastructure, we've got a highway bill that traditionally is done every 6 years. And what we're saying is, let's ramp up what we're doing, let's beef it up a little bit, because we've got this infrastructure all across the country that everybody from Governors to mayors to economists to engineers of all political stripes have said is holding us back in terms of our long-term competitiveness. Let's get started now rebuilding America.And in terms of paying for some of these things, let's stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Let's stop incentivizing that. Let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the United States of America.Those are all commonsense approaches. Historically, as you know--you've been around this town for a long time--usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on infrastructure. Usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on making sure that research and development investments are made right here in the United States. And so let's get it done.It has nothing to do with the notion that somehow what we did previously didn't work. It worked. It just hasn't done as much as we need it to do. We've still got a long ways to go, and we're going to keep on doing it.", "label": "Implicit"}

Are you leaning towards maintaining tariffs, prohibiting forced-labor imports, or restricting U.S. investment in China? [SEP] Those are valid points, but they only touch upon the multifaceted nature of our relationship with China. I've known Xi Jinping for a considerable period, longer than many other world leaders. We've engaged in extensive conversations, delving into significant detail. He's very straightforward, but he doesn't embrace democratic principles. He believes autocracy is the future. After my election, we had a substantial conversation. I stressed that we're not pursuing confrontation, but we will engage in strong competition and insist that China abide by international norms: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. To compete effectively, we must invest in American workers and scientific advancement. We once allocated over 2% of our GDP to research; now it's just 0.7%. I plan to rectify that. We're also dedicated to reinforcing our alliances. This isn't about being anti-China; it's about democracies collaborating. I'll be speaking with European leaders soon, and I recently convened the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the US) to ensure China is held responsible. I'm also planning to host an alliance of democracies to discuss the future. We must hold China accountable for its behavior in the South China Sea, regarding Taiwan, and on human rights.

A new Senate report this morning contends that your administration was warned before the war that by invading Iraq, you would actually give Iran and Al Qaida a golden opportunity to expand their influence, the kind of influence you were talking about with Al Qaida yesterday and with Iran this morning. Why did you ignore those warnings, sir? [SEP] Ed, going into Iraq, we were warned about a lot of things, some of which happened, some of which didn't happen. And obviously, as I made a decision of—as consequential as that, I weighed the risks and rewards of any decision. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. I know the Iraqis are better off without Saddam Hussein in power. I think America is safer without Saddam Hussein in power.As to Al Qaida in Iraq, Al Qaida is going to fight us wherever we are. See, that's their strategy. Their strategy is to drive us out of the Middle East. They have made it abundantly clear what they want. They want to establish a caliphate. They want to spread their ideology. And they want safe haven from which to launch attacks. They're willing to kill the innocent to achieve their objectives, and they will fight us. And the fundamental question is, will we fight them? I have made the decision to do so. I believe that the best way to protect us in this war on terror is to fight them.And so we're fighting them in Iraq; we're fighting them in Afghanistan; we've helped the Philippines fight—Philippine Government fight them. We're fighting them. And this notion about how this isn't a war on terror, in my view, is naive. It doesn't reflect the true nature of the world in which we live.You know, the lessons of September the 11th are these: We've got to stay on the offense; we've got to bring these people to justice before they hurt again; and, at the same time, defeat their ideology with a ideology based upon liberty. And that's what you're seeing, and they're resisting it.I think it ought to be illustrative to the American people that Al Qaida is trying to stop new democracies from evolving. And what does—what should that tell you? That ought to tell you that we're dealing with people that have an ideology that is opposite of liberty and will take whatever measures are necessary to prevent this young democracy from succeeding.The danger in this particular theater in the war on terror is that if we were to fail, they'd come and get us. And, you know, I look at these reports right here in the Oval Office. For people who say that we're not under threat, they just simply do not know the world. We are under threat.

[SEP] We're still gathering information. I expect to speak with President Erdogan soon. Turkey, like any nation, has the right to defend its territory. It's crucial that Russia and Turkey communicate to understand what happened and prevent escalation. This highlights the ongoing issue of Russian operations near the Turkish border, targeting moderate opposition supported by Turkey and others. If Russia focused on ISIS, these conflicts would be less likely. This underscores the need for political progress. Russia is welcome in our coalition against ISIS. The challenge is Russia's focus on supporting Assad. I told President Putin that if they shift to the Vienna process and focus on ISIS, there's potential for cooperation. Until then, it's difficult.

[SEP] It doesn't matter what world leaders think on Iran. Iran's going to come back to me and they're going to make a good deal, I think. Maybe not. Deals: you never know.But they're suffering greatly. They're having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama. Far greater. When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people. You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that. But I'm sticking up for the people.

{"sentence": "President Obama, considering the congressional gridlock surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, what alternative strategies are you exploring to ensure its ratification, and should currency manipulation be explicitly addressed within the agreement? Furthermore, what are your thoughts on the recent elimination of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur, and does this signify a change in U.S. policy regarding Afghanistan? [SEP] Well, let me tell you, on TPP, I've been around this town long enough to know that trade deals are always a tough sell. Everyone's angling for a better deal, and with so many parties involved, you can bet they're going to pick it apart, debate it endlessly, and in an election year, try to score some cheap political points. But having said all that, I'm still confident we'll get it done, because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country, good for America, good for the region, good for the whole darn world. This is the fastest-growing part of the planet, a massive market for the United States. Most of these countries already sell their goods to us with relatively low tariffs. Meanwhile, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold over there. So a deal that eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in the largest, fastest-growing markets is a no-brainer for American businesses and workers. One of the biggest gripes about trade deals in the past has been that they open our markets to countries with lower wages, unfair labor practices, and lax environmental regulations. But if you're signing up for TPP, you're making legally binding commitments to raise labor standards, give workers a voice, and address environmental concerns. That gives us the opportunity to engage with countries like Vietnam and work with them on all those issues. I haven't heard a single credible argument that we'll be worse off with TPP. It's clear as day that we'll be better off. American workers and businesses will benefit if we get this deal passed. The politics will be messy, just like they were with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too. Now, about currency manipulation, we've got provisions in TPP that improve transparency and reporting. Some folks have argued that we should have enforceable rules that allow us to slap tariffs on countries that devalue their currency too much. But the problem is, it's really hard to figure out why a currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, forcing other countries to make commitments about their monetary policy would mean we'd be tying the hands of our own Federal Reserve, and we're not going to do that. We have strengthened the provisions that will allow us to call out countries that we think are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, about the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it's been confirmed that he's dead. He was the guy calling the shots, specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops in Afghanistan. This doesn't mean we're changing our strategy. We're not going back to day-to-day combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country. But when we've got a high-profile leader who's been consistently involved in operations and plans to harm U.S. personnel and who's been blocking peace talks, then it's my duty as Commander in Chief to step in and send a clear message to the Taliban that we're going to protect our people.

One of the things that David and I discussed was the increasing challenge that we're going to face as a consequence of the Internet and the need for us to cooperate extensively on issues of cybersecurity. The President doesn't get involved in decisions around prosecutions, extradition matters. So what I expect is that my team will follow the law, but they will also coordinate closely with what we've just stated is an ally that is unparalleled in terms of our cooperative relationship. And I trust that this will get resolved in a way that underscores the seriousness of the issue, but also underscores the fact that we work together and we can find an appropriate solution.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Given the withdrawal of Canada and South Korea, are you worried about international support for the war in Afghanistan, and are the additional U.S. troops sufficient to end the conflict? [SEP] Well, I've always deferred to our military commanders for recommendations on achieving our objectives. We've added troops twice during my presidency, and the Obama administration plans to continue that. This is what our generals advise. This is a long struggle; ideological battles take time. As civil society and political institutions develop, extremism diminishes. I can't specify troop levels, but our generals say this is what we need now, and I trust President-elect Obama will listen to them as well. We appreciate the assistance from nations helping Afghanistan, including Canada. Their withdrawal plans don't contradict our understanding. They'll continue to assist in other ways. It's crucial to fight terrorism and strengthen Afghanistan with an improved economy and governance, enabling them to stand on their own. The Afghan people don't want to be a burden forever. We're grateful for the international community's support. The Taliban was brutalizing the Afghan people and are no longer in power. Girls are returning to school, boys are flying kites, health clinics are opening, and universities are expanding. The Taliban wants to regain power and can't stand a free society. They're lethal, but that doesn't mean we withdraw. It's in the U.S.'s interest to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for Al Qaida again. Al Qaida is weakened, but we'll stay on the hunt.

{"sentence": "Q. And do you think that execution and the flaws in the rollout will affect your ability to do other things, like immigration reform and other policy priorities? [SEP] Well, look, if it comes to immigration reform, there is no reason for us not to do immigration reform. And we've already got strong bipartisan support for immigration reform out of the Senate. You've got—I met with a number of traditionally very conservative clergy who are deeply committed to immigration reform. We've got the business community entirely behind immigration reform. So you've got a bunch of constituencies that are traditionally much more—have leaned much more heavily towards the Republicans who are behind this.So if people are looking for an excuse not to do the right thing on immigration reform, they can always find an excuse: We've run out of time, or this is hard, or—the list goes on and on. But my working assumption is people should want to do the right thing. And when you've got an issue that would strengthen borders, make sure that the legal immigration system works the way it's supposed to, that would go after employers who have been doing the wrong thing when it comes to hiring undocumented workers and would allow folks who are here illegally to get right with the law and pay a fine and learn English and get to the back of the line, but ultimately join fully our American community—when you've got a law that makes sense, you shouldn't be looking for an excuse not to do it. And I'm going to keep on pushing to make sure it gets done.Am I going to have to do some work to rebuild confidence around some of our initiatives? Yes. But part of this job is the things that go right, you guys aren't going to write about; the things that go wrong get prominent attention. That's how it has always been.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding your meeting with Prime Minister Najib, you stated you would raise concerns about corruption and human rights. What specific message did you convey about the 1MDB scandal and the jailing of political opponents? [SEP] Let's talk about the refugee program first. Paris happened just a week ago. The news cycle is so fast that we sometimes lose sight of events. The Paris attacks were recent and pervasive in the news, and people are understandably concerned given the similarities between Paris and many American cities. That's why the House acted quickly. I hope that now that we have some time to reflect, people will understand that refugees coming to the United States are the most thoroughly vetted individuals. The process, developed over several administrations on a bipartisan basis, is extraordinarily thorough and takes 18 to 24 months for approval. The House legislation, while seemingly simple, could effectively halt the refugee program if it becomes too bureaucratic. Adding layers of bureaucracy that don't improve screening but make processing impossible would be detrimental. When I spoke of betraying our values, I was referring to suggestions of prioritizing Christian refugees over Muslims, or fearing a 4-year-old orphan. Those of you who saw the children at the refugee center understand who we're talking about. If you're a parent and you saw those children, you'd understand that we need to find them a home in America. Most people, knowing the screening process, would agree. Regarding Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on investigations in the United States, and I certainly won't comment on foreign investigations. However, I did raise the importance of transparency, accountability, and rooting out corruption with Prime Minister Najib, as I have with leaders in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These are impediments to development and contribute to poverty and stunted growth. Countries that solve these problems will thrive, regardless of resources or geography. I also emphasized the importance of civil society and a free press. Countries are at different stages of development, and we don't expect everyone to follow the same path as the United States. But some basic principles are important for us to uphold as friends and partners. Take Myanmar, which just had a historic election after 40 years of military rule. They won't be Sweden overnight, but there's a sea change taking place, and we want to encourage that. Our work through the Open Government Partnership and TPP is designed to raise the bar. Some will progress, some will regress, but the trajectory is towards a world where ordinary people are treated fairly, there's rule of law, transparency, accountable governments, people's voices are heard, women are treated equally, and minorities are not discriminated against. These are American values, but also universal values. Thank you.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning your upcoming discussion with President Putin, what will be your guiding principles? Furthermore, considering the evolving dynamics of the Ukrainian conflict, do you assess President Zelenskyy's insistence on the return of Crimea as a prerequisite for negotiations to be a feasible stance? [SEP] The straightforward resolution to this conflict involves Putin's complete withdrawal from Ukraine. However, he appears unwilling to concede, despite the significant repercussions and the devastation he's causing. I currently have no immediate intentions of engaging with Mr. Putin. I am open to discussions if he demonstrates a genuine desire to seek a resolution to the conflict, in coordination with our allied partners. As of now, he has not done so. It is imperative that we continue to support the Ukrainian people. The notion that Putin could prevail over Ukraine is simply inconceivable. He has fundamentally misjudged the situation. He anticipated a warm reception from the Russian-speaking segments of the Ukrainian populace. Review his address at the time of the invasion. He aspired to emulate Peter the Great. He emphasized the significance of Kyiv as the cradle of Russian identity. He has been mistaken on all fronts. Therefore, the pertinent question is, how does he extricate himself from this predicament? I am prepared, should he be amenable to dialogue, to ascertain his intentions, but only in collaboration with our NATO allies. I will not proceed unilaterally. Regarding your inquiry concerning the preconditions established by the Ukrainian President, I believe it is crucial for us to acknowledge that, as Ukraine continues to resist, enduring war crimes and attacks on its civilian infrastructure while simultaneously launching a counteroffensive, President Zelenskyy has presented a comprehensive 10-point peace plan. I firmly believe that we must maintain our engagement with him, as Ukraine exhibits a genuine commitment to addressing these matters. We recognize and commend this commitment. For several years, I was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. During the most recent meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, the only one of its kind, which took place in December 2019, I was accompanied by Chancellor Merkel. I can attest to the fact that I witnessed a President who was genuinely sincere in his willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiations. From the time of his election until May, President Zelenskyy consistently demonstrated a strong desire to engage in discussions and negotiations. It was President Putin who harbored the desire to initiate and wage war. I personally observed this, including during my visits to Russia and Ukraine in early February. Consequently, it is entirely reasonable for President Zelenskyy to establish certain conditions for negotiations. We must work towards identifying the elements that could pave the way for a peace accord, but it is ultimately his prerogative to inform us when the time is right and to articulate the choices available to the Ukrainian people. Having stated this, I will continue to engage with President Putin. In fact, we addressed this matter this morning with President Biden, as we consistently strive to prevent escalation and achieve tangible outcomes. I will engage with him regarding the security and safety of nuclear facilities in the contested regions, particularly Zaporizhzhia. Over the past several months, we have undertaken efforts at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA, are continuing important work.

Thanks in part to this very conference, Ukraine has pledged to complete this process within the next couple of years. All the commitments we're discussing are already in motion, even before the communique and work plan are finalized. This shows a strong, unified understanding of the global threat. We also have a framework of international conventions, though some, including those addressing nuclear terrorism and trafficking, still await ratification, even by the U.S. This summit establishes an ambitious plan, and I'm heartened by the progress we're seeing on efforts that have been stalled for years, some since the end of the Cold War.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Yes. Both countries have spoken about the challenge of climate change. But there is a view that ambitious targets are set, but implementation is found often lacking. And there is also a criticism of lack of technological transfer, financial transfer from the developed countries to the developing nations.How do you both leaders see the way ahead on this pressing issue? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think it is the existential threat to humanity: climate change. It's the most serious problem we face as human beings. We have to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We've made enormous progress here in the United States on dealing with this issue by doing three things.Number one, by insisting that we move our—every one of our industries into a position where they can take advantage of cheaper and more extensive and more available renewable energy, whether it's solar or wind or hydrogen and green hydrogen. There's a whole range of things we've been working on.In addition to that, we find ourselves in a position that—what we've done is that we have significantly reduced the—for example, I made a commitment that we are going to make sure that by 2030, 30 percent of all our land and sea and oceans were—are—were in conservation, could not be developed. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's also absorbing carbon from the air as a consequence of that, because of the conservation.We are in a position, as well, by—we have provided for significant increase in funding for a whole range of issues, but not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.For example, we're working with the G-7 to provide for infrastructure work for dealing with global warming on the continent of Africa: in Angola, building the largest solar project; moving ourselves—having railway to go all the way across the southern two-thirds—the—from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, in Africa, to be able to transport and do it cheaper and do it with less—how can I say it?—less carbon emissions.We're trying to work with other countries to maintain their carbon sinks so they don't have to develop them like we did and causing pollution. And we're trying to figure out how to work out to pay them not to develop certain areas, like the Amazon in Brazil.But there's a lot of technology that's available that we're sharing, and we share with one another. We've learned how to do solar energy, which is considerably cheaper than it is to—for fuel—for fossil fuels. The same way dealing with not just solar, but dealing with wind.And so there's a lot of the technology that we've developed. And we're well on our way, I think, to meeting the commitment we made to—that we made in Paris. And I—and we're prepared to share all of that with India, that has a desire to do the same. Excellency, you said very rightly that, as far as India is concerned, the environment, climate, these are extremely important in our cultural traditions. For us, the environment is an article of faith. This is not just something that we need to do for convenience; we believe this.We do not believe in the exploitation of nature. In order for all of creation to work, we can make nature—but we cannot have exploitation of nature, and we have always believed this.And on the basis of these values, we are not only doing things for ourselves, but are taking some global initiatives, as well. You perhaps know that the G-20 countries, the promises they made in Paris, of all the G-20 countries, India is the only country that has fulfilled all the promises it made at the G-20.Not just that, in the area of solar energy, in Glasgow, we had set ourselves a target to achieve 500 gigawatts of renewable energy. By 2030, we have set ourselves a target to make Indian railways net zero.And you must understand the scale of Indian railways. When we talk about Indian railways, it means that every day the entire population of Australia travels in our wagons—in our railway wagons, on our trains. And we have set ourselves a target to achieve net zero for our railways.We have also set ourselves targets for solar energy, for ethanol—10 percent mix of ethanol. We have completed this target before the set date.We are also working in the area of green hydrogen. We want India to be a green hydrogen hub, and we are working towards this.In—and the International Solar Alliance has been launched by India, and many countries have joined it and are working with India. The island countries, we have helped them in the area of solar energy so that they have now got a new confidence that we are with them in their efforts to fight climate change. And we will not only fulfill our responsibilities, but we will also help you in the area of climate change.We have seen that due to natural calamities—people talk about the death of people, no doubt, when there are natural disasters, but there is a lot of destruction of infrastructure as well.And therefore, because of climate change, the kind of crisis we are feeling, we need to develop infrastructure that is resilient. And therefore, we have created a global organization called CDRI. And you perhaps know that in Glasgow I presented a subject to the world. And recently, it was launched by the U.N. Secretary General and myself. That is Mission LiFE. And when I say LiFE, I mean Lifestyle for the Environment. Therefore, every individual must live his life in a pro-environment, pro-development way. And we are working towards this.And I am sure that whatever work India has started in all these areas—not because India has adversely affected the environment of the world; we are doing this because we have a concern for future generations. We do not want to give our future generations a world that make life difficult for them.And therefore, as a global responsibility, India has not caused any problems to the environment. However, we are playing a leading role in contributing in a positive manner.As far as prosperous countries are concerned, there's always been talk about technology transfer, financial support, and there are some countries that need to have technology transfer, financial support. And we hope that as soon as we can move forward in this area, we will be able to solve this challenge of climate change. Thank you very much. Let me add one thing. We have caused damage in the United States the way we developed over the last 300 years. And that's why I was able to convince my colleagues in the Congress to pass legislation—the largest climate fund ever in American—in the world history: $369 billion—$369 billion—to deal with the climate crisis.And we are doing it extensively now, and I think you're going to see significant progress.Thank you all very, very much.[]", "label": "Implicit"}

Your critics say you failed to send enough troops there at the start, failed to keep Al Qaida from stepping into the void created by the collapse of Saddam's army, failed to put enough pressure on Iraq's Government to make the political reconciliation necessary to keep the sectarian violence the country is suffering from now from occurring. So why should the American people feel you have the vision for victory in Iraq, sir? [SEP] Those are all legitimate questions that I'm sure historians will analyze. I mean, one of the questions is, should we have sent more in the beginning? Well, I asked that question, Do you need more? to General Tommy Franks. In the first phase of this operation, General Franks was obviously in charge—and during our discussions in the runup to the decision to remove Saddam Hussein after he ignored the Security Council resolutions. My primary question to General Franks was, do you have what it takes to succeed? And do you have what it takes to succeed after you succeed in removing Saddam Hussein? And his answer was, yes.Now, history is going to look back to determine whether or not there might have been a different decision made. But at the time, the only thing I can tell you, Wendell, is that I relied upon our military commander to make the proper decision about troop strength. And I can remember a meeting with the Joint Chiefs, who said, We've reviewed the plan. I remember— and seemed satisfied with it. I remember sitting in the PEOC, or the Situation Room, downstairs here at the White House, and I went to commander and commander that were all responsible of different aspects of the operation to remove Saddam. I said to each one of them, do you have what it takes? Are you satisfied with the strategy? And the answer was, yes.We have worked hard to help this country reconcile. After all, they do have a modern Constitution, which is kind of a framework for reconciliation. And after all, there was a significant series of votes where the people were given a chance to express their desire to live in a free society. As a matter of fact, 12 million Iraqis went to the polls.Wendell, what happened then, of course, is that the enemy, Al Qaida, attacks the Samarra mosque, which, of course, created anxiety and anger amongst the Shi'a. And then all of a sudden, the sectarian violence began to spiral. Reconciliation hadn't taken hold deep enough in society to prevent this violence from taking hold. And so I have a—you know, I've got to decide whether or not it's okay for that violence to continue or whether or not it makes sense for us to try to send more troops in to quell the violence, to give the reconciliation process further time to advance.My concern is, is that as a result of violence and killing, there would be chaos. Now, that's a state of affairs that thugs like Al Qaida need to survive. They like chaos. As a matter of fact, they like to create chaos in order to create conditions of fear and anxiety and doubt. And out of that chaos would come—could come a further escalation of violence in the Middle East. And this is what's important for the American people to understand: that violence and that chaos would embolden extremist groups, whether they be Shi'a or Sunni, and they would then begin into competition with each other.Such chaos and violence would send a mixed signal to the Iranians, who have stated that they believe Israel ought to be wiped off the map. People would begin to wonder about America's resolve. Al Qaida would certainly be in a better position to raise money and recruit. And what makes all this scenario doubly dangerous is that they have proven themselves able to attack us and kill nearly 3,000 of our citizens. And they would like to do it again.And therefore, the strategy has got to be to help this Government become an ally against these people. What happens in Iraq—and I understand how difficult it's been. It's been hard. I have received a lot of inspiration, however, from meeting with our troops, who understand the stakes of this fight, and meeting with their families.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, on Afghanistan, do you believe the Pakistan-brokered talks between the Taliban and President Karzai hold promise, or do they concern you? And do you agree with Prime Minister Cameron that we can be totally out of Afghanistan by 2015? [SEP] I'm not sure about that Cameron quote, but let me address the second part first. We've been in Afghanistan for nine years, soon to be a decade. It's our longest war. We all want Afghanistan to be stable, self-sufficient on security, and not a base for attacks against the U.S. We'll need to assist Afghanistan for a long time, helping them build a government, courts, police, and a fair political system. But that's different from having troops on the ground. Our policy, announced last November, involves sending in additional troops to give the Afghan government space to build its security forces, blunt the Taliban, and improve governance. General Petraeus is continuing this policy, endorsed by our allies and President Karzai. It's a tough challenge, given Afghanistan's poverty, illiteracy, and history of war. By the end of this year, we expect to see progress. We'll review and adjust as needed, both on the civilian and military sides. Ultimately, like in Iraq, we need a political solution. As for the negotiations, it's too early to tell. We should be skeptical but open. The Taliban is a mix of ideologues, tribal leaders, and recruits. President Karzai's peace jirga and the Kabul conference are useful steps, as are talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

And, President, perhaps you could elaborate on that remark. What do you mean by that? [SEP] You want me to go?. Do you want to go first? I think it's been very bad for Europe. I think Europe is a place I know very well, and I think that what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation. I mean, you see the same terror attacks that I do. We see them a lot. We just left some incredible young men—men and women—at Sandhurst. And they were showing us cells, and they were showing us things that, frankly, 20 years ago nobody even thought about. Probably a lot more recently than that, nobody even thought about.I just think it's changing the culture. I think it's a very negative thing for Europe. I think it's very negative. I think having Germany—and I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel. Great relationship with Germany. But I think that's very much hurt Germany. I think it's very much hurt other parts of Europe.And I know it's politically—not necessarily—correct to say that. But I'll say it, and I'll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture. You are changing a lot of things. You're changing security. You're changing—look at what's happening. I mean, you take a look. I mean, look at what's happening to different countries that never had difficulty, never had problems.It's a very sad situation. It's very unfortunate. But I do not think it's good for Europe, and I don't think it's good for our country. We're, as you know, far superior to anything that's happened before, but we have very bad immigration laws, and we're—I mean, we're doing incredibly well considering the fact that we virtually don't have immigration laws. We have laws that are so bad, I don't even call them laws. I call them—it's just like, you just walk across the border. You walk across the border—you put one foot on the land and now you're tied up in a lawsuit for 5 years. It's the craziest thing anyone has ever seen.So I would just make that recommendation to Europe. I've made it very loud and clear. I made it yesterday in—29 countries total. And that's the way I feel.. The U.K. has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country. We have a proud history of welcoming people who want to come to our country to contribute to our economy and contribute to our society. And over the years, overall, immigration has been good for the U.K. It's brought people with different backgrounds, different outlooks here to the U.K. and has—and we've seen them contributing to our society and to our economy.Of course, what is important is that we have control of our borders. What is important is that we have a set of rules that enables us to determine who comes into our country. And of course, that is what, as a government, we have been doing for a number of years and will be able to continue to do in the future.Mr. President. /North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia-U.S. Relations/Poisoning of Former Russian Intelligence Operative Sergei Viktorovich Skripal in Salisbury, United Kingdom", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Given the bipartisan opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, can you elaborate on your strategy to overcome congressional resistance and address the holdup in the Senate? [SEP] Well, the reason a consensus bill hasn't emerged in the Senate is because this is a complex issue requiring bipartisan cooperation. It's crucial to first establish a coherent Republican position in the Senate, which is where we're currently focusing our efforts. Senator Kennedy will lead the bill on the Democrat side. Once we achieve a unified Republican stance, one that most Republicans support, we'll collaborate with the Senator. Without sufficient consensus, nothing will pass the Senate, and consequently, nothing will happen in the House. Therefore, the initial stages of crafting a bill that addresses concerns are time-consuming but essential to address the issues raised during the last immigration reform debate. I'm optimistic that we can achieve something, and we're beginning to find common ground. There's broad agreement on a temporary-worker plan allowing individuals to legally come to the U.S. for jobs Americans aren't doing. This would greatly benefit Guatemalan citizens, eliminating the need to enter the country illegally, pay smugglers, or live in hiding. They'd be able to enter legally. Secondly, they'd be able to return home to their families legally, without fear. There would be a time limit, which is part of the negotiations.

I thought Putin's idea about Iran's nuclear fuel was smart. Also, we need to find a way for them to understand that our missile defense system in Europe isn't pointed at them, but at real dangers.

{"sentence": "Q. A question to President Duda. Mr. President, so far, we have been talking about a rotational presence of U.S. troops in our country. Right now we are talking about permanent or enduring presence. What does that mean in concrete terms? And when can we expect those additional U.S. troops to arrive? [SEP] I understand it in the follow way: President Donald Trump and myself are implementing a very calm but consistent policy in terms of security. The presence of the United States in Poland—the military presence—the presence of U.S. troops, which today is about 4,500 troops present on a permanent basis. In other words, it is a rotational presence but it is back-to-back presence. So there is no moment where there are no American troops in the territory of Poland.And today we signed a document and further cooperation: a Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation Regarding the United States Force Posture in the Republic of Poland. This is of a breakthrough character because it moves us to another era. So far, we can say that the Americans were testing the situation in Poland: how it looks, how it feels; what about logistics; whether it is possible to stay in Poland and to successfully attain the goals and implement the tasks of defensive nature.I think that the commanders of U.S. Army are convinced that this is simply possible. And today, the documents speaks about this enduring presence, the presence which is a fact and which will stay there.It is a rotational presence as it is because this is most beneficial from today's perspective to train soldiers through rotational presence. By having rotational presence, more soldiers can come to a country, be present there, look at a culture and the condition in place in a given country. So this is beneficial for this barely understood—a development of the Armed Forces. Therefore, this is an enduring presence. However, it is implementing this particular way.And we hope it's going to develop 1,000 troops, mentioned by President Trump today, which is also—the numbers stipulated in the agreement signed today is very differentiated. It is not one single unit. We are talking about special operation forces. We are talking about logistics component. We are also talking about the already-mentioned division headquarters.So there is a multitude of forums in which the United States is going to be gradually ever-more present in our territory, from the military standpoint. And this will encompass different fields of cooperation. So we're not talking about just one single beat, but we're talking about a more comprehensive cooperation. We're talking about logistics health protection for soldiers and a number of other elements happening. Please remember that right now there is this missile defense facility being built in Redzikowo. So, talking about the elements of Polish-American cooperation, there are more and more of these elements, and the number is growing. I'm very happy with that. Thank you very much.

So we're getting the remains back.Secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for—how long has it been? Seven months? You haven't had a missile go up. For 7 months, you haven't had a nuclear test; you haven't had a nuclear explosion. I remember a nuclear event took place, 8.8 in the Richter scale. And they announced—I heard it on the radio, they announced that a massive—you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in Asia. And then, they said it was in North Korea. And then, they found out it was a nuclear test. I said, I never heard of a Richter scale in the high 8s.And if you look, there has been no missile launches. They've blown up their missile area. That's going to take place. That has not been written into the contract. We're going to give you the exact details on that. But they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests. They secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test flight—test site. All three of them—they're in an area that's common around each other—they secured the closure.They secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site. That was not in your agreement. I got that after we signed the agreement. I said: Do me a favor. You've got this missile engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat. We—it's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you. I said, Can you close it up? He's going to close it up.We maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions.

Will you be able to convince your colleagues in Poland and the Czech Republic to be as transparent as you are going to be in missile defense issues?

They'll spend money to avoid the system.And I view this as defensive, not offense. And obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to convince the experts that the system is not aimed at Russia. It's really to help deal with the threats that we all are going to face. And therefore, the vision about having a global system is something I strongly support, where we're working cooperatively together. Look, there's a lot of—we got a lot of way to go.And as to your question about the Czech Republic and Poland, it's important for the leaders in those countries—and I've discussed the issue with them—to understand that Russia is not an enemy; Russia is somebody with whom we need to work. And we'll work through the differences there as well. Transparency is going to require more than just a briefing. Transparency is going to require true openness in a system.I have no problem with that. I have no problem sharing technologies and information to make sure that all people understand this system is designed to deal with multiple—I mean, single-or dual-launch regimes that could try to hold us hostage. This system is not designed to deal with Russia's capacity to launch multiple rockets.Now, we got work to do, but we've come a long way since our first discussions. And this document really does express a vision that will make it better for America and Russia when—to work together along these lines. And so yes, I thank you for your question.Russia-U.S. Relations//North Atlantic Treaty Organization", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Afghanistan, what's the projected timeline for troop withdrawal, similar to the 16-month plan for Iraq? Also, will you overturn the Pentagon's ban on media coverage of the return of fallen soldiers at Dover Air Force Base, a policy previously criticized by Senator Biden? [SEP] First, let me express my deep sorrow for the loss of four American service members in Iraq today. My thoughts and prayers are with their families. It's a constant reminder of the gravity of this office. Concerning media access at Dover, we are reviewing the policy in consultation with the Department of Defense, and I'll provide an answer after a thorough evaluation. Afghanistan is a different situation. While Iraq has shown progress with a functioning political system, Afghanistan's government seems disconnected. The Taliban and Al Qaeda operate freely in the border regions. We're conducting a comprehensive review, involving General Petraeus and Ambassador Holbrooke, to develop a regional approach. We need better coordination between military, diplomatic, and development efforts. But let's not forget why we're there: 9/11. We can't allow Al Qaeda to operate with impunity. I don't have a specific timetable yet, but I won't let them plan attacks on our homeland.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Q. Good evening to all of you. I also have a couple of questions, one for President Bush—good evening, sir—and it is about Iraq. You've spoken about a change in the country. Do you think it might be at all possible to have a withdrawal, maybe a partial withdrawal, of U.S. troops? And if so, when do you think that might be?My second question is for you, Prime Minister Berlusconi. Today the President talked about the fact that Italian foreign policy might change pace, as it were, thanks to the dialogue that has been established among the political forces in Italy. Do you think that is so, and if you do, how do you think you can uphold the dialogue with the opposition in Italy? [SEP] The progress is such on the security front that we're—are bringing troops home. We anticipate having the troops that went in for this—what's called the surge—back home by July. General Petraeus will come back; he'll assess the situation—come back to the United States—and make further recommendations. I don't know what those recommendations will be. I have told the American people, though, that conditions on the ground, the situation in Iraq, should determine our troop levels.And so we are in the process of what's called return on success. And I had the honor of going to see the 82d Airborne that had been in Iraq, and they came home. And it was—I was—I am constantly amazed at the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I'm also pleased with the courage and commitment of the Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq. The situation is dramatically different than what it was a year ago. And United States and our allies must send a clear message to the Iraqis: We'll stand with them as their democracy continues to evolve and their economy continues to grow. And now my question: I'm very happy to acknowledge the forecast made by the President of Italy with regard to the attitude being shown by the opposition. And we are happy to think that the opposition might like to support our foreign policy, and our foreign policy will go along the same lines that we pursued in our previous Government for those 5 years.And this is a pro-European integration foreign policy. It is a foreign policy which is based on the idea that we don't have two Western worlds, we don't have Europe on one side and the U.S. and Canada on the other. When we talk about the West, we mean only one West. And our foreign policy aims at being based on cordial relations with an important country such as the Russian Federation.So our policy is going to require our effort to strengthen the ties and the cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation. And it is a policy that will consider NATO to be the vehicle which will help to maintain and uphold peace throughout the world, as it has done over the past decades.Now, what about the wounds in the world, at—where we know that they're going to need our generosity? Democracies are going to have to help those people who cannot establish freedom on their own. And as I said earlier, we think that this is the only way that we can possibly pursue in order to enable and ensure peace throughout the world after having fully eliminated terrorism.Now let me also acknowledge your vision, Mr. President, your policy, and the courage that you have shown throughout all the years, of hard work on behalf— on the part of your administration. You've always expressed your ideas with great courage, your ideals for the future, your vision for the future. I have gotten to know President Bush very well. I consider him to be a very close friend, a very unique person. And when he says no, he means no; when he says yes, it means yes. And he's always known—he's always shown that he has been able to be very close to those friends of his who have shared his ideals.I thank you very much, Mr. President, for your friendship between the two of us, on a personal level, your friendship shown to our country. And I thank you for the very courageous role that you have always taken as the leader of the most important country in the world and—which is able to determine peace and freedom throughout the world.Thank you once again.

Look at what they did by not keeping that within the confines of China. They should have kept it in the confines of China. Look what they've done to 188 countries all over the world.

Won't it signal to potential leakers, including those associated with groups like WikiLeaks and their alleged Russian connections, that disclosing classified information carries minimal consequences? Furthermore, now that Julian Assange has offered to come to the US, will your administration pursue his arrest and prosecution? [SEP] Look, let's get one thing straight: Manning served time, a considerable amount. Anyone thinking about spilling secrets shouldn't assume it's a walk in the park. I believed her sentence was out of whack compared to others, especially given her acceptance of responsibility and the due process she underwent. Commuting, not pardoning, felt right. Justice was served, and the message remains clear: national security matters. We want whistleblowers to use proper channels. As for WikiLeaks, I haven't focused on them. The intel community's Russia findings weren't conclusive about WikiLeaks' involvement in the DNC email leak. Assange's tweets? Irrelevant to my decision. The Justice Department handles any legal issues with him. In this digital age, we need to balance openness with security. Bad actors will exploit our transparency.

In my tenure as President, I have encountered many remarkable individuals in diverse settings, and I was deeply moved by this encounter. We did not specifically address the concept of 'just war.' However, he did express significant concern regarding the welfare of Christians in Iraq, fearing that the evolving social landscape might not be conducive to their religious freedom. I assured him of our commitment to upholding the Constitution, ensuring respect for individuals from all backgrounds. We also discussed our efforts to address HIV/AIDS, malaria, and hunger in Africa. I highlighted our substantial investment, which has increased access to antiretroviral drugs from 50,000 to over 1.1 million individuals. I intend to seek a doubling of this commitment. We also discussed our malaria initiative and our objective to reduce its prevalence by 50% in select countries. I emphasized the importance of global cooperation in eradicating malaria throughout Africa.

I'm confident that any agreement we reach will enhance the security of the United States, Israel, and the region. Turning to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the critical question is what the parties themselves believe is possible. Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed doubts about the viability of a Palestinian state, and I respect his views. While he has outlined conditions under which a Palestinian state might be conceivable, those conditions appear difficult to achieve in the short term. The fundamental question is whether we can establish a process that provides Palestinians with hope for a secure future alongside Israel. Given Prime Minister Netanyahu's statements, that seems unlikely. We are currently reevaluating our approach to this issue. Our commitment to Israel's security is unwavering and our cooperation will continue. However, we must be realistic about the prospects for progress between Israelis and Palestinians. The absence of progress could lead to further instability. Our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel will continue. Our review is specifically focused on the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. We will engage with both sides to understand their perspectives.

America's been taken advantage of for too long. Thank you. Regarding Japan defense equipment, a lot of them we purchase from the United States. North Korean situation becoming very tough, the Asia-Pacific security situation becoming very tough, we qualitatively and quantitatively, we have to enhance our defense capability. As the President mentioned, F-35A is a case in point. SM-3 Block IIA is another plan for purchase from the United States. Aegis vessels, the quality and the quantity must be enhanced. In that process, we will be buying more from the United States. That is what I am thinking. Now, North Korea: North Korea launched missiles. Immediately after that, we traced them; we were able to grasp and trace where they were going. Missile defense is something which is based upon the cooperation between Japan and the United States. Missile defense system is a cooperation between the two countries. For the intercepting and shooting down, if it is necessary, of course, we will do that—if it is necessary. But in doing so, U.S. and Japan will closely coordinate our actions. Thank you.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the growing wealth gap, what concrete steps is your administration taking to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities for all citizens? [SEP] Look, the great thing about this country is that everyone gets to speak their mind, even if they're yelling at me. I've been protested plenty of times, and I'm sure every president has. So, I'm not going to tell anyone to be quiet. But I will say this: elections matter, voting matters, getting involved matters, being informed matters. And to all the young people out there, don't take our system for granted. It's not guaranteed. It takes work. If a huge chunk of eligible voters don't even bother to vote, then democracy suffers. If we can't tell the difference between real news and fake news, especially with all the social media garbage, then we're in trouble. And if people refuse to compromise and engage in the process, if they're just taking extreme positions and hating on their opponents, then democracy will crumble. So, my advice is to understand the foundations of a healthy democracy and to be a citizen all the time, not just when you're upset or when there's an election. It's a constant effort. And the good news is, there are a lot of young people who are ready to do that work. But I think sometimes we get complacent. Here in Europe, a lot of young people have forgotten the lessons of the Cold War, what it was like to have a wall. And I've heard some rhetoric here that equates the U.S. and Russia, like there's no difference between our governments. We're not perfect, we've made mistakes, but we've generally tried to uphold values like free speech and civil liberties. And that's something to remember. Because in this age of misinformation, where everything looks the same on a Facebook page, it's easy to lose sight of what's important. We need to know what to protect, what to fight for. Otherwise, we could lose everything we've gained. Anyway, that was a long answer. I think there was a second part to the question, but I got carried away.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just appeared together in their first campaign event, right before you've got up on this podium. Can you tell us if you watched their remarks and give us your reaction to them? [SEP] I didn't watch. I saw just a moment of him speaking a moment of her speaking and it was enough.Look he made a choice: He picked her. I watched her. I watched her poll numbers go boom boom boom down to almost nothing. And she left angry. She left mad. There was nobody more insulting to Biden than she was. She said horrible things about him including accusations made about him by a woman where she I guess believed the woman. And now all of a sudden she's running to be Vice President saying how wonderful he is.I thought it was a very unusual pick because she said such bad things. And you know better than anybody what—you know you won't write it because you know you don't want to do that—but you know better than anybody. She said horrible things about him. Horrible things. And she mocked him openly mocked him. That's why I thought that was a very risky pick because I'm sure that'll be played back—not necessarily by me but others—it will be played back.The other thing if you look she wants a $3 trillion tax hike. No fracking. How do you think no fracking in Pennsylvania is going to play? That's a big fracking State. If you didn't have energy produced that way you would have taxes that would triple and you'd have unemployment that you wouldn't believe.And Pennsylvania last year had the best year they've ever had. Texas last year had the best year they've ever had. Oklahoma best year. Almost every State in our Nation last year had the best year they've ever had. And they're going to have that again next year. And you can see that by what—but think of it: She wants no fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. Really? Tell that to Texas.And then I hear Trump is only one point up in Texas. No they said the same thing with Crooked Hillary Clinton. They said: Texas is in play. Trump is down in Texas. And then I won Texas. Immediately when they said the polls are closed Trump has won Texas. And I won by a lot. And I won Georgia by a lot. It's the same thing over—it's almost like a duplication of what happened before except we have much more energy now than we ever did in 2016 and we had a lot. We had record amounts in 2016.But you take a look at the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country by far. Right? He wants to increase everybody's taxes. And she's one of the people that wants that.I mean you take a look at that. She wants to defund or at least substantially reduce money going to police departments. And you can't do that. You can't do that. It's actually got to be the opposite. I've been endorsed by so many police departments. I'm getting a really good one this week that you'll be seeing really big really good.But who could ever—what police department what law enforcement group could ever support Joe Biden where he said things that are so bad and so foolish—frankly so stupid—in terms of crime and what would happen. So we're getting all of law enforcement.We're getting the military. She wants to spend much less on our military. I've rebuilt the military. We have the strongest military now. Much of the equipment is coming in all made in the United States; $2.5 trillion we spent.When I took over we had a military that was totally—it was in terrible terrible shape. It was depleted. It was a depleted military: old planes old tanks old everything. And we have a beautiful brandnew military with the best people in the world. We never had anything like it. Some of the equipment is still coming in.No we have—we've done a real job. And I think we're going to be extremely successful. I was surprised that he picked her—very surprised—because of the horrible way she talked about him. And frankly because she dropped like a rock.I didn't when I ran. I ran against 17 people mostly Governors and Senators some others. Ben Carson was very strong very good. A couple of others but mostly Governors mostly Senators. And I ran and I went up.She ran and she went down to rock bottom. I don't think she ever got to run her first—to take a vote in her first—in the first State. And so generally speaking you don't want to pick somebody that went down and she went down. But she went down in a very terrible way and she said horrible things about Biden.She said far worse about Biden than I ever did. And now she's running as Vice President.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, Germany is attempting to revitalize the Middle East Quartet. Given past failures and the perceived limitations of European influence on US foreign policy, can you cite a specific instance where a conversation with a European leader demonstrably altered your stance on a significant issue? [SEP] Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it a 'change of mind,' but my European colleagues have underscored the importance of the United Nations in securing parliamentary support for difficult decisions. For instance, obtaining UN resolutions is crucial for countries like Denmark or the Netherlands to justify their actions to their respective parliaments. Now, personally, I've never felt that the United States requires UN approval to act in its own security interests. However, I've come to appreciate that other nations rely on the UN, and I respect that. So, in that sense, I've learned a valuable lesson from our allies. I hold Angela Merkel in high regard. She possesses considerable wisdom. I'm not sure if this helps or hurts her, but my consultations with Angela are consistently productive and important. Strong US-Europe relations are essential for achieving our shared objectives, be it trade, peace, or security. These relationships can be challenging at times, with differing viewpoints across Europe. Yet, Angela consistently provides sound advice on addressing common challenges and ensuring our alliance serves the common good. I am a strong believer in this multilateral effort in these international fora, because it shows clearly where the redline is to those who do not wish for democracy.

Few of the models have been accurate.But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people.

Do you feel any need to reprioritize your agenda? [SEP] I've never not prioritized this. No one has worked harder to deal with the violence used by individuals using weapons than I have. I'm the only one ever to have passed an assault weapons ban. I'm the only one that ever got a 10-year ban on assault weapons and clips of more than 10 bullets.Immediately upon us becoming in office, having an Attorney General, I asked him to put together the things I could do by Executive order, including dealing with new guns that can be made—you can buy in pieces and put together, and other initiatives.I strongly support—I strongly support—the universal background checks, which I continue to push.

{"sentence": "Q. Just really quickly, you mentioned the issue of a two-state solution with Israel. I was wondering if you would give your reaction to what the Pope is moving forward with in terms of recognizing the Palestinian state. Do you think that's a good idea? Do you think it's a mistake? And do you think it might help or hinder the two-state solution that you mentioned earlier? [SEP] Okay. Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the Senate on moving forward on providing me the authority to not only strike a smart, progressive, growth-promoting trade deal with some of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region and potentially in Europe as well, but also to give me the tools to enforce those agreements, which haven't always happened in the past.So I want to thank all the Senators who voted to provide that authority, or at least to begin the debate on moving that process forward. Those who didn't vote for it, I want to keep on trying to make the case and provide them the information they need to feel confident that despite the fact that there have been very genuine problems with some trade deals in the past, the approach that we're taking here, I think, is the right one, not just for big U.S. businesses, but also for small U.S. businesses and medium-sized U.S. businesses and, most importantly, ultimately, American workers. I would not be promoting any agreement that I didn't think, at the end of the day, was going to be creating jobs in the United States and giving us more of an opportunity to create ladders of success, higher incomes, and higher wages for the American people, because that's my primary focus. It has been since I came into office.The issue with respect to myself and Elizabeth has never been personal. I mean, I think it's fun for the press to see if we can poke around at it when you see two close allies who have a disagreement on a policy issue. But there are a whole bunch of—some of my best friends in the Senate, as well in the House, some of my earliest supporters who disagree with me on this. And I understand. Because, like me, they came up through the ranks watching plants close, jobs being shipped overseas. Like me, they have concerns about whether labor agreements or environmental agreements with other countries are properly enforced. Like me, they have concerns about whether in fact trade ends up being fair and not just free.And, like me, they have a deep concern about some of the global trends that we've seen and trends that we've seen in our own country in terms of increased inequality and what appears to be the effects of automation and globalization in allowing folks at the very top to do really, really well, but creating stagnation in terms of incomes and wages for middle class families and folks working to get their way into the middle class.So these are folks whose values are completely aligned with mine. I noticed that there was sort of a progressive statement of principles about what it means to be a progressive by some of these friends of mine, and I noted that it was basically my agenda, except for trade. [] Right? That was the one area where there was a significant difference. And this just comes down to a policy difference and an analysis in terms of what we think is best for our people, our constituents.It is my firm belief that, despite the problems of previous trade deals, that we are better off writing high-standard rules with strong, enforceable provisions on things like child labor or deforestation or environmental degradation or wildlife trafficking or intellectual property; we are better off writing those rules for what is going to be the largest, fastest growing market in the world. And if we don't, China will, and other countries will. And our businesses will be disadvantaged, and our workers will ultimately suffer.And in terms of some of the fears of outsourcing of jobs, it is my belief, based on the analysis, that at this point, if there was a company in the United States that was looking for low-cost labor, they have no problem outsourcing it under the current regime. And so what we do have the opportunity to do is to attract back companies to manufacture here in the United States.And we're seeing some of that happen. That's why I went out to Nike. I understand that Nike has been manufacturing shoes with low-cost labor in many of these areas in the Asia-Pacific region and that hurt the American footwear industry in terms of jobs here in the United States. But that happened over the course of the last 30 years. And now, for Nike to announce that because of new technologies, they're potentially bringing 10,000 jobs back here because we've gone up the value chain, we're manufacturing in different ways, that's an opportunity. But we've still got to be able to sell over there to take full advantage of those opportunities.Which is why my argument with my progressive friends is, what we really need to be focusing on to meet the same objectives—the shared objectives—is the kinds of other issues that we all agree on: strong minimum wage, strong job training programs, infrastructure investments that put people back to work, stronger laws to protect collective bargaining and the capability of workers to have a voice, strong enforcement of rules around things like overtime pay, making sure that we have paid sick leave, making sure that we have a honest conversation about our budgets and that we're not slashing investments in the future simply to make sure that we're preserving loopholes for corporations that don't provide any economic benefit.Those are the things that are going to help us address the very problems that they're concerned about. Blocking a trade deal will not, particularly since they're the first ones to acknowledge that the existing trade rules are a bad deal for U.S. workers. If they're not working for us now, how does hanging on to what's going on now help American workers? It doesn't make sense.I'm all for enforcement and the provisions that were signed. I have expressed concerns about how the currency language that is in the bill is drafted. But I have to talk to Senator Schumer and Sherrod Brown and others about how we can work on language that does not end up having a blowback effect on our ability to maintain our own monetary policy.I don't even remember what your other question was.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, are you reconsidering--thank you, Mr. President. Are you reconsidering your plan to cut the interest rate deduction for mortgages and for charities? And do you regret having proposed that in the first place? [SEP] No, I think it's the right thing to do, where we've got to make some difficult choices. Here's what we did with respect to tax policy. What we said was that over the last decade, the average worker, the average family have seen their wages and incomes flat. Even at times where supposedly we were in the middle of an economic boom, as a practical matter, their incomes didn't go up. And so what we said, let's give them a tax cut, let's give them some relief, some help, 95 percent of American families.Now, for the top 5 percent, they're the ones who typically saw huge gains in their income. I fall in that category. And what we've said is for those folks, let's not renew the Bush tax cuts, so let's go back to the rates that existed back in--during the Clinton era when wealthy people were still wealthy and doing just fine; and let's look at the level in which people can itemize their deductions. And what we've said is let's go back to the rate that existed under Ronald Reagan.People are still going to be able to make charitable contributions. It just means, if you give $100 and you're in this tax bracket, at a certain point, instead of being able write off 36 or 39 percent, you're writing off 28 percent. Now, if it's really a charitable contribution, I'm assuming that that shouldn't be a determining factor as to whether you're given that $100 to the homeless shelter down the street.And so this provision would affect about 1 percent of the American people. They would still get deductions. It's just that they wouldn't be able to write off 39 percent. In that sense, what it would do is it would equalize--when I give $100, I'd get the same amount of deduction as when some--a bus driver, who's making $50,000 a year or $40,000 a year, gives that same $100. Right now he gets 28 percent--he gets to write off 28 percent; I get to write off 39 percent. I don't think that's fair.So I think this was a good idea. I think it is a realistic way for us to raise some revenue from people who benefited enormously over the last several years. It's not going to cripple them; they'll still be well-to-do. And ultimately, if we're going to tackle the serious problems that we've got, then in some cases those who are more fortunate are going to have to pay a little bit more.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Sir, concerning the Syrian crisis, did President Putin suggest any inclination for Assad to step aside during your discussions? Furthermore, were any concrete measures agreed upon with either Putin or President Hu to halt the ongoing bloodshed? [SEP] Look, Syria was a major talking point in both meetings, no doubt about it. The violence there is just completely unacceptable, with civilians in the crosshairs and Assad having lost all credibility. When you're slaughtering your own citizens like that, there's no way you can have a peaceful transition that leaves Assad in charge. But getting to that transition is not easy. Russia, with its history with Syria, and China, which usually stays out of other countries' business, have been hesitant to put the pressure on that's needed. We had a very honest conversation. I wouldn't say that the U.S. and the rest of the world are on the same page as Russia and China right now, but I do think they see the serious risks of a full-scale civil war. I don't think they're okay with the massacres, and I think they believe that everyone would be better off if Syria could stop the violence and create a real government. I've told them that it's important for the world to work with the UN and Kofi Annan on a plan for how to move forward. I'm hoping we can keep talking about this and show the world, and especially the Syrian people, a way to end this conflict. But I can't say that the Russians and the Chinese are totally on board yet. What I can say is that they know the situation is serious and that it's not good for them or for the Syrian people. We all agree that if we can help the Syrian people find a way out of this, we'd all be better off. But I personally believe, and I told them this, that I don't see any way that Assad stays in power and the violence goes down. He had a chance with the Annan plan, but he didn't do his part. Instead, we saw things get worse and innocent people getting killed. Now, the international monitors have had to leave because of the violence. And even though some people say the opposition is also using violence, and there's evidence of that, I think it's also fair to say that the awful things we saw in places like Homs were directly caused by the Syrian government, and Assad is ultimately responsible.", "label": "General"}

They want a timeline for transitioning to overwatch, where we're training, providing logistics, and conducting special ops. For our troops to be there, we need an agreement with the government, authorities to operate, and protections for our troops. We're negotiating that now.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, back to the oil price— tax breaks that you were talking about a minute ago. Back when oil was $55 a barrel, you said those tax breaks were not needed; people had plenty of incentive to drill for oil. Now the price of oil is $100 a barrel, and you're planning to threaten a plan that would shift those tax breaks to renewables. Why, sir? [SEP] I talked, Mark—I talked about some of the breaks. And this is a— this generally is a tax increase, and it doesn't make any sense to do it right now. We need to be exploring for more oil and gas. And taking money out of the coffers of the oil companies will make it harder for them to reinvest. I know they say, well, look at all of the profits. Well, we're raising the price of gasoline in a time when the price of gasoline is high.Secondly, we've invested a lot of money in renewables. This administration has done more for renewables than any President. Now, we got a problem with renewables, and that is, the price of corn is beginning to affect food—cost of food, and it's hurting hog farmers and a lot of folks. And the best way to deal with renewables is to focus on research and development that will enable us to use other raw material to produce ethanol. I'm a strong believe in ethanol, Mark. This administration has got a great record on it. But it is a—I believe research and development is what's going to make renewable fuels more effective.Again, I repeat: If you look at what's happened in corn out there, you're beginning to see the food issue and the energy issue collide. And so, to me, the best dollar spent is to continue to deal with cellulosic ethanol in order to deal with this bottleneck right now. And secondly, the tax—yes, I said that a while ago, on certain aspects. But the way I analyze this bill is, it's going to cost the consumers more money. And we need more oil and gas being explored for; we need more drilling; we need less dependence on foreign oil.And as I say, we're in a period of transition here in America, from a time where we were—where we are oil and gas dependent to, hopefully, a time where we got electric automobiles, and we're spending money to do that; a time when we're using more biofuels, and we've taken huge investments in that; a time when we've got nuclear power plants and we're able to deal with the disposal in a way that brings confidence to the American people—so we're not dependent on natural gas to fire up our—a lot of our utilities and a time when we can sequester coal.That's where we're headed for, but we've got to do something in the interim. Otherwise, we're going to be dealing, as the man said, with four-dollar gasoline. And so that's why I'm against that bill.I thank you. It's been a pleasure. Enjoyed being with you.", "label": "Explicit"}

It depends on both countries remaining stable and successful. If America remains a leading economy, and Singapore maintains its success, there are many opportunities for us to make common cause together. If there's a U.S. leader who is more closed off, I don't think this is the right forum to talk about U.S. politics. We will work with whoever is the U.S. administration. Singapore is the adult in the room, the level head, that can help us work with a wide range of countries around certain issues, help defuse tensions. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow.

This is my second trip, and I want to remind everyone that it's in our interest to help Africa with diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS, to promote trade, and to support education. Ghana is a great place to see this firsthand. It's different than just giving speeches in America. Africa has changed positively since I became president, thanks to African leaders. We've helped resolve conflicts, like in Liberia, where we supported the first democratically elected woman president. Democracy is growing, thanks to leaders like John Kufuor. Our aid program now requires good governance, like fighting corruption and investing in education. I believe in setting high standards for African leaders. The leaders I'm meeting are committed to their people and honest government. They want to leave a legacy of education, not self-serving government.

Are you worried that the common European policy towards Russia might collapse? And after Mr. Trump's election, wouldn't you have to declare your candidacy again as a sign of civility? [SEP] I generally avoid interfering in other countries' politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an exceptional partner. She's perhaps the only leader among our closest allies who was there when I arrived, making us veterans of many challenges over the past 8 years. While we haven't always agreed on every issue, her core values, integrity, truthfulness, thoughtfulness, diligence, knowledge, and commitment to the interests of the German people, while recognizing the importance of global engagement and multilateral institutions, have been outstanding. It's her decision whether to run again, and ultimately, the German people will decide. If I were German, I might support her. As for Russia, my approach has been consistent since I took office. Russia is an important country, a military superpower with global influence. Cooperation with Russia is in our interest to solve many global problems. We should hope for a successful Russia with a growing economy and good relations with its neighbors. I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but I'm realistic about our differences. We can't set aside our values of democracy, free speech, international norms, and the rule of law. We've had significant differences on issues like Ukraine and Syria. I hope the President-elect will take a similar approach, finding areas for cooperation while standing up to Russia when it deviates from our values. I'm encouraged by the President-elect's commitment to NATO. Regarding my conversations with President Putin, they occurred before the election. There's clear proof of their cyber attacks, which isn't new. We've delivered a clear message that meddling with elections or targeting private organizations is unacceptable, and we'll respond appropriately. We need international frameworks to prevent a cyber arms race. We've started working on principles at the G-20, G-7, and U.N. levels, but more work is needed. The transition period in the United States is working smoothly, with the outgoing administration sharing its knowledge with the incoming one. This encourages us to continue the good cooperation between the United States and Germany. I'll approach this with an open mind and a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. On Russia, it's about respecting certain principles. From a European perspective, peace depends on respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty. The reverse would be a slippery slope. We're pinning our hopes on political efforts like the Normandy process. Russia is our neighbor, and we have an interest in a good relationship.

We acted decisively to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, with a clear mandate and congressional consultation.

I don't know. It's not because I think he's interested in changing the nature of a closed society or government's actions relative to what he thinks is the right of government to do what it does; it's a very different approach. There are some really good biographies – I told him I read a couple – I read most everything he's written and the speeches he's made. And I've read a couple of very good biographies, which many of you have as well. I pointed out to him that Russia had an opportunity – that brief shining moment after Gorbachev – to generate a democratic government. But it failed, and there was a great race among intellectuals to determine what form of government they would choose. Based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided that Russia has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a Russian state, not based on ideology – whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution, the Russian Revolution, and to where they are today. I think it's clear to me that he decided that the way for Russia to sustain itself as a great power is to unite the Russian people on just the strength of the government – the government controls – not necessarily ideologically, but the government. I think that's the choice that was made. I'm not going to second guess whether it could have been fundamentally different. But I do think it does not lend itself to maintaining itself as one of the great powers in the world.", "label": "General"}

President Quang, what are your concerns regarding TPP's U.S. reception and China's criticism of U.S. policy in Asia? [SEP] Angel, regarding TPP, having spent time in the Senate, I know trade deals are always challenging. Everyone seeks a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved, leading to scrutiny and debate. In an election year, political posturing is inevitable. Nevertheless, I remain confident in its passage because it's the right thing to do for America, the region, and the world. This is the fastest-growing region, a significant market for the U.S. While these nations already sell to us with low tariffs, ours are higher. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods, benefiting American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for exposing us to countries with lower wages and lax standards. However, TPP includes enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and address environmental issues, enabling engagement with countries like Vietnam on these fronts. I haven't seen a compelling argument that TPP will worsen our situation; it demonstrably improves it. The politics will be turbulent, as with past agreements, but we'll get it done. Concerning currency manipulation, TPP enhances transparency and reporting. While some advocate for enforceable provisions, distinguishing manipulation from natural fluctuations is difficult, and we can't cede control of our monetary policy.

And of course, we need to keep working on the Korean free trade agreement. Hopefully, we can bring back a successful Doha negotiation for a vote, which means we need to extend TPA. And we need to keep this budget balanced. The deficit's been reduced more than expected, thanks to increased tax revenues and our fiscal measures. But we need Congress to be responsible and not overspend or raise taxes. That would hurt the economy. And of course, we can't forget the war on terror. I'd like to find common ground with Democrats and Republicans on Iraq, but some just want to cut and run. I disagree with that. Most Americans do. Immigration is a tough issue. It's emotional. I've always believed in comprehensive reform. I campaigned on it. I understand the frustrations about illegal immigration, which is why we've been working to secure the border. We're doubling the Border Patrol, building fences, and using new equipment. I even sent the National Guard down there for a while. This bill addresses those concerns. It sets benchmarks for border security before any other reforms take place. But you can't have real border security without a temporary worker program. People will come here to work, and they'll find a way. That creates an underground industry of smugglers and document forgers. It's antihumanitarian. We need to give people a legal way to come here and work temporarily. And we need a tamper-proof ID card to verify employment. The tough part is what to do with the people already here. Some people want to kick them all out, but that's not realistic. And we can't just give them automatic citizenship. So we've come up with a plan where they have to meet certain requirements to get a Z visa, like background checks and fines. They go to the back of the line for citizenship. If you support the bill, thank you. If you don't, you can find a reason to oppose it. It's easy to pick it apart. But I believe it's the right thing to do. I want to get it done because it will solve the problem. I want to get it out of politics. Immigration debates can bring out the worst in people. We're a land of immigrants. I was touched by the story of the Coast Guard ensign whose grandfather was a migrant from Mexico. He's serving America with pride. That's what immigration can mean for America.

We're also talking to different Finance Ministers about how we can send a message to the ian Government that the free world is just not going to tolerate the development of know-how in how to build a weapon or at least gain the ability to make a weapon.And the reason why is, is because it's very important for us to take the threats coming out of the mouth of the President of very seriously.

We know we've got roads and bridges and airports and electrical grids that need to be rebuilt. But without the cooperation of Congress, what I can do is speed up the permitting process, for example. I can make sure that we're working with the private sector to see if we can channel investment into much-needed projects. But ultimately, Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I don't have a green light.What I am consistently going to do is, wherever I have the legal authorities to make progress on behalf of middle class Americans and folks working to get into the middle class, whether it's by making sure that Federal contractors are paying a fair wage to their workers, making sure that women have the opportunity to make sure that they're getting paid the same as men for doing the same job, where I have the capacity to expand some of the student loan programs that we've already put in place so that repayments are a little more affordable for college graduates—I'm going to take—I'm going to seize those opportunities. And that's what I think the American people expect me to do.My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but it's going to be longer lasting. And when you look at, for example, congressional inaction, and in particular, the inaction on the part of House Republicans, when it comes to immigration reform, now, here's an area where, as I've said before, not only the American people want to see action, not only is there 80 percent overlap between what Republicans say they want and Democrats say they want, we actually passed a bill out of the Senate that was bipartisan.And in those circumstances, what the American people expect is that, despite the differences between the parties, there should at least be the capacity to move forward on things we agree on. And that's not what we're seeing right now. So in the face of that kind of dysfunction, what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress.And we're going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you, the American people don't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done. Even as we take these executive actions, I'm going to continue to reach out to Democrats and Republicans—to the Speaker, to the leadership on both sides and in both Chambers—to try to come up with formulas where we can make progress, even if it's incremental.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. But to follow, we were speaking about the war, and during the campaign, two very different viewpoints of the war came out. You spoke a lot, as Bret mentioned, about what you saw as the Democratic approach to the war, which you were greatly concerned about. Are you worried that you won't be able to work with the Democrats, or do you feel like you have to prevail upon them your viewpoint? [SEP] Well, I think we're going to have to work with them, but—just like I think we're going to have to work with the Baker-Hamilton commission. It's very important that the people understand the consequences of failure. And I have vowed to the country that we're not going to fail. We're not going to leave before the job is done. And obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with some Members of Congress. I don't know how many Members of Congress said, Get out right now— I mean, the candidates running for Congress in the Senate. I haven't seen that chart. Some of the comments I read where they said, Well, look, we just need a different approach to make sure we succeed—well, you can find common ground there.See, if the goal is success, then we can work together. If the goal is, get out now regardless, then that's going to be hard to work together. But I believe the Democrats want to work together to win this aspect of the war on terror.I'm also looking forward to working with them to make sure that we institutionalize, to the extent possible, steps necessary to make sure future Presidents are capable of waging this war. Because Iraq is a part of the war on terror, and it's—I think back to Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. I mean, Harry Truman began the cold war, and Eisenhower, obviously, from a different party, continued it. And I would hope that would be the spirit that we're able to work together. We may not agree with every tactic, but we should agree that this country needs to secure ourselves against an enemy that would like to strike us again. This enemy is not going away after my Presidency.And I look forward to working with them. And I truly believe that Congresswoman Pelosi and Harry Reid care just about as much—they care about the security of this country, like I do. They see the—no leader in Washington is going to walk away from protecting the country. We have different views on how to do that, but their spirit is such that they want to protect America. That's what I believe.Just like I talked about the troops—I meant what I said. Look, the people that's—are going to be looking at this election—the enemy is going to say, Well, it must mean America is going to leave. And the answer is, no, that doesn't—what it means. Our troops are wondering whether or not they're going to get the support they need after this election. Democrats are going to support our troops just like Republicans will. And the Iraqis have got to understand, this election—as I said, don't be fearful. In other words, don't look at the results of the elections and say, Oh, no.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned that the U.S. and its European allies have reached a consensus on extending the sanctions against Russia. Is there a consensus, though, about what specifically the next step should be if Russia continues to violate the Minsk agreement? And also if—can you deter Russian aggression in other parts of Eastern Europe without a permanent U.S. troop presence?And separately, I wanted to ask you about the possibility that the court battle over your actions on immigration could extend late into your term. Do you think that there's anything more that you can do for the people who would have benefited from that program and now are in limbo? And how do you view the possibility of your term ending without accomplishing your goals on immigration? [SEP] On Ukraine and Russia and Minsk, there is strong consensus that we need to keep pushing Russia to abide by the terms of the Minsk agreement; we need to continue to support and encourage Ukraine to meet its obligations under Minsk; that until that's completed, sanctions remain in place.There was discussion about additional steps that we might need to take if Russia, working through separatists, doubled down on aggression inside of Ukraine. We—those discussions are taking place at a technical level, not yet at a political level, because I think the first goal here going into a European Council meeting that's coming up is just rolling over the existing sanctions. But I think at a technical level, we want to be prepared.Our hope is, is that we don't have to take additional steps because the Minsk agreement is met. And I want to give enormous credit to Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, who have shown extraordinary stick-to-itiveness and patience in trying to get that done.Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin. He's got to make a decision: Does he continue to wreck his country's economy and continue Russia's isolation in pursuit of a wrongheaded desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire, or does he recognize that Russia's greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?And as I mentioned earlier, the costs that the Russian people are bearing are severe. That's being felt. It may not always be understood why they're suffering, because of state media inside of Russia and propaganda coming out of state media in Russia and to Russian speakers. But the truth of the matter is, is that the Russian people would greatly benefit. And ironically, one of the rationales that Mr. Putin provided for his incursions into Ukraine was to protect Russian speakers there. Well, Russian speakers inside of Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Their economy has collapsed. Their lives are disordered. Many of them are displaced. Their homes may have been destroyed. They're suffering. And the best way for them to stop suffering is if the Minsk agreement is fully implemented.Christi—oh, immigration. With respect to immigration, obviously, I'm frustrated by a district court ruling that now is wending its way through the appeals process. We are being as aggressive as we can legally to, first and foremost, appeal that ruling, and then to implement those elements of immigration executive actions that were not challenged in court.But obviously, the centerpiece, one of the key provisions for me was being able to get folks who are undocumented to go through a background check—criminal background check—pay back taxes, and then have a legal status. And that requires an entire administrative apparatus and us getting them to apply and come clean.I made a decision, which I think is the right one, that we should not accept applications until the legal status of this is clarified. I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security's legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we're doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we're doing is lawful.But the United States is a government of laws and separations of power, and when a—even if it's a individual district court judge who's making this determination, we've got to go through the process to challenge it. And until we get clarity there, I don't want to bring people in, have them apply and jump through a lot of hoops, only to have it deferred and delayed further.Of course, there's one really great way to solve this problem, and that would be Congress going ahead and acting, which would obviate the need for executive actions. The majority of the American people, I think, still want to see that happen. I suspect it will be a major topic of the next Presidential campaign.And so we will continue to push as hard as we can on all fronts to fix a broken immigration system. Administratively, we'll be prepared if and when we get the kind of ruling that I think we should have gotten in the first place about our authorities to go ahead and implement. But ultimately, this has never fully replaced the need for Congress to act. And my hope is, is that after a number of the other issues that we're working on currently get cleared, that there—some quiet conversations start up—back up again, particularly in the Republican Party, about the shortsighted approach that they're taking when it comes to immigration.Okay.

Secretary Gates and General Pace went up to Congress and testified to the effect that those combat troops are going to need some support. And that's what the American people are seeing in terms of Iraq, the support troops necessary to help the reinforcements do their job. My hope, of course, is that Congress provides the funding necessary for the combat troops to be able to do their job, without any strings attached.Secondly, in terms of Afghanistan, I did announce, as a result of a review of our policy, an additional 3,200 troops. But in addition to that, the troops that you're referring to are going to be part of a training and embedding mission that I did also discuss during that strategy, although I didn't have any details of the troops. Colombia is a loyal ally to the States, and it shows solidarity towards Latin America as well. We have promoted more integration with the U.S.A. through Plan Colombia and the free trade agreement and more integration with Latin America as well. The Andean community, it has been led by Colombia and has an agreement signed with MERCOSUR. We have contributed to the creation of the South America Union. Colombia has been recently accepted as the main member of a Plan Panama Puebla.So we are looking also for a trade agreement with Canada. We are about to close negotiations with three Central American countries. And as you can see, this is our democratic and loyal international policy. With our sister countries, we have very good relations. We respect, and we ask everyone to respect, the guiding principles of international public law, as well as the respect for the autonomy in each country and the principle of nonintervention. We have to help one another in promoting freedom and in overcoming poverty and in conquering health.I have to mention something about the question that was asked to Number one, the whole world must know that this country was affected for 30 years by the Marxist guerrillas; that these guerrillas infiltrated politics and journalism; that they infiltrated the labor movement and labor unions, universities. And the truth was never demanded, which is something we have to demand in the future.Number two, the world must know that many—during these years, some regions in Colombia were not protected. Number three, the world must know that the guerrillas and the lack of protection was what generated the paramilitarism. Number four, the world must know that this administration is the first one that has started fighting directly against the paramilitarism. There is a political discussion going on, but the paramilitary aggression has gone down radically.Why? Because the law on justice and peace has let most—has resulted in most of the paramilitary leaders being in jail because our security policy has actually eliminated more than 1,700 of these paramilitary groups' members. And I'd like to have so many people from other countries in Colombia present here to be able to say that most of the crimes that are being tried and prosecuted happened before my administration, to say that democratic security has been recovering the transparency in electoral processes in Colombia. Last year's elections, the opposition to my administration has not even one complaint about lack of guarantees. They were able to visit all the places with which in the past were not possible to visit because, on the one hand, there was control by the guerrillas, and there was also paramilitary control in other regions, and they couldn't visit these places.Candidates running for the Presidency in 2006 received effective guarantees. They were able to visit the whole country, and the effect of the democratic security policy was quite evident because there were no pressures against them by the terrorists. The only pressure in the year 2006 were against the people who supported my campaign in departments in the southern part of the country, where FARC, together with the drug traffickers, introduced a strike, and they threatened those who were going to vote for me. And this is something that the world should be aware of. And there were candidates to Congress and the President from all ideological movements.The world must also know that it is a government that has asked for the truth; that the government is promoting the law on justice and peace; that it is this administration that has made the decision of dismantling the criminal machinery of the paramilitaries; that it was the government who made the decision to put them in jail; that it is this Government that has made the decision that they have to give out their own assets to—for the reparations of the victims; and that it is the government that has made the decision of supporting justice fully.For the first time, the supreme court of justice in Colombia, which is an independent branch, has its own investigators. Thanks to the will of this administration of funding this group, we are dismantling what was built for many years, for more than three decades. Terrorism advanced in taking parts of Colombia, and terrorism made progress in suppressing freedoms, in threatening journalists, in assassinating labor union leaders. And of all this, we are actually making progress.So I think I have to tell an anecdote as well. Not long ago, I was asked if the government supported direct transmissions on TV of the hearings where the paramilitaries are being tried before the prosecutors. And I said that the government supported this transmission alive and direct because that is the way to get the truth. So instead of being afraid for telling the truth, we have been supporting truth. Instead of looking for ways out of justice, we are trying to support justice as much as possible.Let's talk about the Director of the security agency, the DAS. When he left this agency, there were no complaints of links with paramilitaries against him. And he was then accused of facts that were known months after he left this agency, the security agency. And I have to discuss these subjects because these are subjects that are becoming increasingly important in international debates. The Minister of Defense has said that if there were any militaries related to terrorist organizations, they will be withdrawn from their positions.But we cannot fall into the trap of the guerrillas, that we should weaken the armed forces. We are not going to make them weak, because this is the only way we have to have a country without any guerrillas and without any paramilitaries. There are members—if there are members of this Government that have any links to these organizations, will be immediately removed from their offices.And so I am concerned for the question asked by the journalist. And he said—and this is not correct—that there are many members of the government related or with links with paramilitary groups. And this is a contradiction because this is the first government ever that has prosecuted the paramilitaries, that has actually killed some of the paramilitaries and sent others to jail. We are going to eliminate paramilitarism, and we are going to eliminate the guerrillas, because we can't fall in the trap that poses a paramilitary scandal that will actually do away with all the results in democratic security.The Minister of Defense, at lunch, was saying that we are going to levee a tax on the wealthiest contributors in Colombia so that they can contribute to the consolidation of the democratic security program. And we will demand the truth without any fears, and this is what makes a difference.When I was running for the Presidency, I was not well interpreted. I was saying that Colombia had to eliminate the guerrillas, but perhaps I was misunderstood because I also said that the only way was to recover the institutions and, hence, that we had to eliminate the paramilitaries as well.On August the 7th, I will have been 5 years in power, and throughout all the time—and I say this before a great ally, the President of the United States, and before the world, thanks to the journalists present here—throughout this Government, we have constantly fought the guerrillas, the paramilitaries, and the drug traffickers continuously. Our sole purpose is Colombia free of this plague; our sole purpose is a Colombia that will have strong institutions again. There is nothing to hide here. We are fighting against narco and terrorism. And let that be clear to you all.", "label": "Dodging"}

[SEP] Look, the Constitution sets clear boundaries, and I respect the separation of powers. Congress controls the purse strings, plain and simple.

But it failed, and there was a great race among intellectuals to determine what form of government they would choose. Based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided that Russia has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a Russian state, not based on ideology – whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution, the Russian Revolution, and to where they are today. I think it's clear to me that he decided that the way for Russia to sustain itself as a great power is to unite the Russian people on just the strength of the government – the government controls – not necessarily ideologically, but the government.

If this cease-fire does take effect and appears to be holding, would you and your European counterparts back away from these sanctions that you say you've prepared?

And if I could go back to the Rapid Response Force, can you say specifically what U.S. contributions will be in terms of troop numbers and equipment? Is it beyond the agreement that you announced—or the proposal you announced in Warsaw? [SEP] With respect to the cease-fire agreement, obviously, we are hopeful, but based on past experience also skeptical that, in fact, the separatists will follow through and the Russians will stop violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it has to be tested. And I know that the Europeans are discussing at this point the final shape of their sanctions measures. It's my view that if you look at President Poroshenko's plan, it is going to take some time to implement. And as a consequence, for us to move forward based on what is currently happening on the ground with sanctions—while acknowledging that if in fact the elements of the plan that has been signed are implemented, then those sanctions could be lifted—is a more likely way for us to ensure that there's follow-through. But that's something that obviously we'll consult closely with our European partners to determine.I do want to point out, though, that the only reason that we're seeing this cease-fire at this moment is because of both the sanctions that have already been applied and the threat of further sanctions, which are having a real impact on the Russian economy and have isolated Russia in a way that we have not seen in a very long time.The path for Russia to rejoin the community of nations that respects international law is still there, and we encourage President Putin to take it. But the unity and the firmness that we've seen in the trans-Atlantic alliance in supporting Ukraine and applying sanctions has been, I think, a testimony to how seriously people take the basic principle that big countries can't just stomp on little countries or force them to change their policies and give up their sovereignty.So I'm very pleased with the kind of work that's been done throughout this crisis in Ukraine, and I think U.S. leadership has been critical throughout that process.With respect to the Rapid Response Forces and the readiness action plan that we've put forward, in Warsaw, I announced $1 billion in our initiative. A sizeable portion of that will be devoted to implementing various aspects of this readiness action plan.We've already increased obviously rotations of personnel in the Baltic States, for example. We have the air policing. We have the activities that are taking place in the Baltic and the Black Sea. But this allows us to supplement it. It allows us to coordinate it and integrate it further with additional contributions from other partners. And what it signifies is NATO's recognition that, in light of recent Russian actions as well as rhetoric, we want to make it crystal clear: We mean what we say when we're talking about our article 5 commitments. And an increased presence serves as the most effective deterrent to any additional Russian aggression that we might see.Angela Keane, Bloomberg.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of Speaker Pelosi's recent statements questioning your competence and the veracity of your administration's claims regarding the coronavirus, what is your response? [SEP] Let me be blunt: Pelosi's attacks are nothing more than political theater from a failed politician. She lost the House once, and she's on track to do it again. Honestly, her negativity is just making me more popular – it's almost too easy. Instead of these cheap shots, she should be focused on working together to address this potential problem. It might be a small one, hopefully, but we need unity. And Schumer complaining that we're not asking for enough money? That's a first! Usually, they're screaming about overspending.

Instead of these petty jabs, she should be focused on uniting the country against this potential threat. Maybe it'll be minor, hopefully, but we need to be on the same page. And Cryin' Chuck Schumer?

I personally thanked the helicopter pilots and Coast Guard for their heroic efforts. While improvements could always be made, to call the response slow is to disregard the efforts of those who saved so many lives. Furthermore, I was deeply moved by the reactions after the election, seeing people with tears in their eyes expressing disbelief at the election of a Black president.

The operations in Africa this weekend suggest that the continent is now the central front in the campaign against terrorism, and if we're going to see U.S. military operations all around the continent, how does that square with your contention that American cannot be at war forever? [SEP] Well, if you look at the speech I gave at the National Defense College several months ago, I outlined how I saw the shift in terrorism around the world and what we have to do to respond to it. And part of what I said is, is that we had decimated core Al aida that had been operating primarily between Afghanistan and Pakistan, but you now had these regional groups, some of which are explicitly tied to Al aida or that ideology, some of which are more localized. Few of them have the ability to project beyond their borders, but they can do a lot of damage inside their borders.And Africa is one of the places where, because, in some cases, a lack of capacity on the part of the Governments, in some cases because it is easier for folks to hide out in vast terrains that are sparsely populated, that you're seeing some of these groups gather. And we're going to have to continue to go after them.But there's a difference between us going after terrorists who are plotting directly to do damage to the United States and us being involved in wars. The risks of terrorism and terrorist networks are going to continue for some time to come. We've got to have a long-term plan that is not just military based, we've got to engage in a war of ideas in the region and engage with Muslim countries and try to isolate radical elements that are doing more damage to Muslims than they're doing to anybody else. We've got to think about economic development, because although there's not a direct correlation between terrorism and the economy, there's no doubt that if you've got a lot of unemployed, uneducated young men in societies, that there's a greater likelihood that terrorist recruits are available.But where you've got active plots and active networks, we're going to go after them. We prefer partnering with countries where this is taking place wherever we can, and we want to build up their capacity. But we're not going to farm out our defense.And I have to say, by the way, the operations that took place both in Libya and Somalia were examples of the extraordinary skill and dedication and talent of our men and women in the armed forces. They do their jobs extremely well, with great precision, at great risk to themselves.

[SEP] I won't discuss the specifics of my conversations with President-elect Trump, other than to say they were cordial and substantive. Whether I was persuasive is for him to say.

Makes things harder for our soldiers. Now, about the mosque in New York, I've been clear on this: everyone's equal, got rights, religion's one of them. If you can build a church, synagogue, whatever, you should be able to build a mosque. I get that 9/11's a sensitive thing. I've met with the families, I know their pain. But we're not fighting Islam. We're fighting terrorists who twist Islam. Gotta be clear about that, because we need allies to fight terror. Al Qaeda wants a war between us and Islam. Most Muslims just want the same things we do: jobs, schools, safety. They don't want violence. And we got millions of Muslim Americans, our neighbors, friends, coworkers.

[SEP] Well, those are essentially two separate matters. One concerns our potential return to the JCPOA. And that depends—that's why I convened meetings with my counterparts here in Rome, who are part of the original group of six nations that initially advocated for negotiating a change, a situation that I believe we are still grappling with due to President Trump's ill-advised decision to withdraw from the JCPOA.

Also, can you comment on Mullah Mansur's death and Pakistan's concerns? Does this signal a new offensive in Afghanistan? Are you worried about a more hardline leader? [SEP] On TPP, every trade deal is painful. Folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal. Especially with multiple parties involved, folks are going to scrutinize it. In an election year, some folks are going to try to score political points off it.Having said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done because it's the right thing to do. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good for the world.This is the fastest-growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market for the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest-growing markets of the world, that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers.Historically, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulation. Well, if you're signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice, to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts, the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries.So I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. And I'm confident we will get it passed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korean free trade agreement or the Colombian and Panamanian free trade agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although it will—there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way.With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not something that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way. But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations.Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not re-entering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them.On the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people. And that's exactly the message that has been sent. President Quang. Let me respond to this question concerning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is a significant trade and economic linkage, contributing to sustaining the dynamics and the role as a driver for economic growth in our country, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region.

{"sentence": "Sir, concerning Russia, observers have noted that your Democratic rivals seemed uninformed about Dmitry Medvedev. What are your thoughts on him, especially his power dynamic with Putin? Furthermore, what advice would you offer your successor on navigating the complexities of the Russian threat, considering past critiques of your own handling of Vladimir Putin? [SEP] Medvedev, you say? Truth be told, I'm not deeply familiar with him either. The real indicator will be who represents Russia at gatherings like the G-8. That'll offer insights into Russia's post-Putin foreign policy trajectory. But I can't provide a concrete answer just yet. However, I can affirm that sustaining relations with Russia is paramount. We require their collaboration on matters such as proliferation and Iran. Recall Putin's proposal to furnish enriched uranium to Iran's Bushehr facility, obviating their need for domestic enrichment? That was a positive step. We must be capable of collaborating with Russia on Iran. There exist numerous domains for cooperation. Consider, for instance, the missile defense system in Europe, discussed with the Czech Prime Minister. It's imperative that we convey to the Russians that the system isn't directed at them, but rather at genuine 21st-century threats like violent regimes wielding weapons of mass destruction. Thus, I aim to ensure that my successor can cultivate a relationship with whomever is steering Russian foreign policy. It's in our nation's interest. This doesn't imply perpetual agreement. Disagreements, such as on Kosovo, will inevitably arise. Nonetheless, a leader-to-leader relationship, and ideally beyond, is indispensable.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

Is that, in your view, a viable long-term solution, or should we aim for complete eradication? And considering the limitations of air power, what is your assessment of the Free Syrian Army's capacity to effectively neutralize ISIL on the ground in Syria? [SEP] Let's be clear: containing an organization wreaking havoc on such a scale is simply not feasible. The goal must be to dismantle it entirely. Look at Al Qaeda in the FATA – we pushed them back, degraded their capabilities, shrunk their territory, and took out their leaders. Eventually, they couldn't launch the same attacks. Will remnants remain? Sure. We'll hunt them down, like Al Qaeda remnants or al-Shabaab. But our aim is to dismantle this network so they can't harm us. I'm glad our allies agree. As for Syria, we won't put U.S. troops on the ground to control the conflict. It's not needed. We need effective partners to push back against ISIL. The moderate coalition is one option; we've worked with them. They've been outgunned, so we'll support them better. But remember, when U.S. forces put ISIL on the defensive, ground forces can do a lot, even if they were initially struggling. This is a developing strategy, and we'll consult with our allies. The bottom line is, we'll do what it takes to ensure ISIL doesn't threaten the U.S. or our partners. Next question, please.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the strategic framework agreement with Iraq, could you clarify the timeline for transitioning to 'overwatch' and the specific protections afforded to U.S. troops operating there?

Embedded within that is the security component, which naturally includes discussions about the timeline for what we're calling 'overwatch.' The Iraqis have their own aspirations for how quickly that transition occurs. Now, overwatch, as we envision it, entails a U.S. presence focused on training, logistical support, and special operations. Crucially, any troop presence necessitates a clear understanding with the host government, including operational authorities and protections for our personnel. These negotiations are ongoing, and we aim to finalize them before the year's end, unless the U.N. mandate is extended.

They're concerned with real issues: family, security, and economic stability. The media landscape is so fragmented now; people seek out information that confirms their existing biases.

Although, despite the fact that our fellow country people are still in prison—absolutely innocent, as you well know—I would like to ask you, as a part of the general effort to solve this drama, which has been going on for more than 10—8 years now, my question is: Would you commit yourself to lobbying in front of the U.S. Congress and doing so that some of the funds under your 5-year program for fighting HIV/AIDS can go to supporting the children infected with AIDS and their families?And, President Parvanov, I would be happy to hear your view on the Libya issue, and, notably, how would you comment the fact, or rather the Bulgarian media's idea, who are covering the trial in Libya, to send a letter to the hundred most influential representatives of the economy and business, according to the Forbes ratings, and call on them to donate to the building of modern, up-to-date medical center where children, all people, with HIV/AIDS could be treated? [SEP] There's a fund into which we're contributing money. And I don't think you ought to be concerned about the source of the funding. What you ought to be focused on is whether or not the U.S. is willing to commit funds, along with the EU. And we are. And at the same time, we're willing to send messages to the Libya Government that we expect the release of the nurses. We've been very much in concert with your Government. This is an issue that we care about. And so—but we do agree with the strategy that there ought to be some compensation for the Libyan children and their families. Ladies and gentlemen, many of you know that I have visited Libya; I have visited the hospital in Benghazi. I've spoken with the parents and the infected children, and I'm clearly aware of the great drama they're suffering, they're going through, and how much it needs to be done in order to invest in this hospital and in order to relieve the pain and suffering of both the children and their kin, and their families and friends.This is a Bulgarian; this is a European; this is a commitment of the entire democratic public, worldwide. By all means, Bulgaria and, I believe, our friends from the United States and the European Union consider this not a one-off, not a temporary—an attempt to release the nurses, and then we quit. For us—and I'm happy that this was—we went along with George on this. For us, this is a long-term commitment. This is a commitment we take in respect of the both those suffering in Benghazi, but also everyone suffering of AIDS, not just in Benghazi, but in the whole of Africa. Let's remember G-8 and their decision: $60 billion were allocated to this policy by the world democratic community a few days ago.I, for one, 6 months ago, in addressing the European Parliament, I said—and I appealed to the big players, so to speak, worldwide, in the businesses worldwide, to take a more—a firmer commitment to this fund, to donate more, contribute more to this fund.

There's always going to be some back and forth on both sides. But what's important is the facts. You might read some stories about the U.S. planning on building permanent bases in Iraq. That's just not true. We're there because the Iraqi government wants us there. This agreement is important because it sends a message to the Iraqi people that the security they're seeing now will continue. You can't have democracy or an economy without security.

{"sentence": "Q. Do the tweets and do the statements by Donald Trump embolden Russia? [SEP] Got it. As I said before, I think that the President-elect is still in transition mode from campaign to governance. I think he hasn't gotten his whole team together yet. He still has campaign spokespersons, sort of, filling in and appearing on cable shows. And there's just a whole different attitude and vibe when you're not in power as when you're in power.So rather than me, sort of, characterize the appropriateness or inappropriateness of what he's doing at the moment, I think what we have to see is how will the President-elect operate and how will his team operate when they've been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of Government, and they've got to start making decisions.One way I do believe that the President-elect can approach this that would be unifying is to say that we welcome a bipartisan, independent process that gives the American people an assurance not only that votes are counted properly, that the elections are fair and free, but that we have learned lessons about how Internet propaganda from foreign countries can be released into the political bloodstream and that we've got strategies to deal with it for the future.The more this can be nonpartisan, the better served the American people are going to be, which is why I made the point earlier, and I'm going to keep on repeating this point: Our vulnerability to Russia or any other foreign power is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. That's the thing that makes us vulnerable.If fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn't seem that far fetched compared to some of the other stuff that folks are hearing from domestic propagandists. To the extent that our political dialogue is such where everything is under suspicion, everybody is corrupt, and everybody is doing things for partisan reasons and all of our institutions are full of malevolent actors—if that's the storyline that's being put out there by whatever party is out of power, then when a foreign government introduces that same argument with facts that are made up, voters who have been listening to that stuff for years, who have been getting that stuff every day from talk radio or other venues, they're going to believe it.So if we want to really reduce foreign influence on our elections, then we'd better think about how to make sure that our political process, our political dialogue is stronger than it's been.Mark Landler [New York Times].", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, as you approach the end of your term, what key objectives remain, and how concerned are you that the immigration bill might be derailed by election-year politics? [SEP] Well, we absolutely must get additional energy legislation passed. Renewing No Child Left Behind is crucial. We need those trade bills on Panama, Peru, and Colombia out of Congress, and hopefully, we can build on the progress we've made with the Korean free trade agreement. Ideally, I'd like to bring back successful Doha negotiations for a congressional vote, which necessitates a TPA extension. And we need to maintain our progress on balancing the budget. The deficit is shrinking faster than expected, thanks to increased tax revenues and our fiscal measures. Now, we need Congress to avoid overspending and raising taxes, which would harm the economy and, in turn, Treasury revenues. I'm very worried about the Democrats' classic tax-and-spend budget. I'm eager to see how they plan to balance it in five years. Of course, the war on terror remains a top priority. I'd like to find common ground with Democrats and Republicans on Iraq. Some just want to leave, but I disagree, and most Americans do too. The recent vote showed what's possible when we work together. On immigration, it's a tough issue. I've always believed in comprehensive reform to secure our border. I campaigned on it twice, and I believed it as Governor of Texas. I understand the frustrations about illegal immigration, which is why we've significantly increased border security. We're doubling Border Patrol agents and adding fencing and equipment. I even sent the National Guard down there for a while. This bill addresses those concerns by setting security benchmarks before any other reforms take place. Last year, people wanted security first, and that's what this bill does. However, I don't see how we can have the border security people expect without a temporary-worker program with verifiable work cards. People will come here to work, and they'll find ways to do so. This has created an inhumane underground industry of smugglers and document forgers. It's not American. The best way to deal with this is to offer a temporary opportunity for people to do jobs Americans aren't doing. I'd rather have people crossing with legitimate cards than being smuggled in trucks. Secondly, we need good employer verification. It's illegal to hire someone here illegally, but businesses often can't tell if documents are real. So, we need a tamper-proof ID card, which is part of this bill. A tough issue is what to do with those already here. Some call anything short of deportation amnesty, but you can't deport 12 million people. It's impractical. Nor should they get automatic citizenship. So, we've proposed a plan where they meet certain hurdles to get a Z visa, including background checks, fines, and a probationary period, and then they go to the back of the citizenship line. If you're against the bill, you can find reasons, but it's comprehensive and good. I knew this would be explosive. It's easy to make a political target of someone working hard here. I want to get this bill done because it's the right thing to do and because it will solve the problem. I want to get it out of politics. Immigration debates can bring out the worst in people. We're a land of immigrants. I was touched by the Coast Guard Academy ensign who talked about his migrant grandfather from Mexico. He was proud to serve America. Welcoming people who want to work and realize the American Dream renews our spirit. We have an opportunity to put a good law in place now, but it will be hard work. Politics will get involved, but I hope Members of Congress will rise above it. I will. It's the right thing to do. I'll continue to reach out to them and urge them to show the political courage to get this bill to my desk quickly. Thank you.", "label": "Deflection"}

I wonder how that's going so far, what you've learned about how they think, and does the current debate constitute grounds for divorce? [SEP] Interesting way to put it. First of all, I think they're patriotic people who care about our country—back to Hutch's penetrating comment—or question. I do. I was very appreciative of the reception I got at the State of the Union. It was a cordial, respectful reception that gave me a chance to talk about what I believe. I was also very grateful for the reception I received at the Democratic retreat that I went to there in Virginia.You know, my impression of the meeting there was that we share a lot in common. We're people that actually put filing papers down and ran for office; we're willing to put our families through the grind of politics; we wanted to serve our country, that we care deeply about what takes place in Washington, America, and the world.My hope is, is that we can get positive pieces of legislation passed, because I think there's a lot of expectation that the difference of opinion on Iraq would make it impossible for us to work on other areas. I disagree with that assessment. And I hope I'm right, and the best way to determine whether I'm right is, will I be able to sign legislation that we have been able to work on?One such piece of policy is a balanced budget. There seems to be agreement that we should have a balanced budget. I laid out one way forward to achieve that balance, and it shows that we can balance the budget without raising taxes and do so in a 5-year horizon. And I would like to work with the Democrat leadership as well as obviously my Republican folks, to get it done.Secondly, an interesting opportunity is immigration. As you know, I strongly believe that we need to enforce our borders and that—and have taken steps to do so. But I also believe that in order to enforce the borders, we need a temporary-worker program so that people don't try to sneak in the country to work, that they can come in an orderly fashion, and take the pressure off the Border Patrol agents that we've got out there, so that the Border Patrol agents don't focus on workers that are doing jobs Americans aren't doing but are focusing on terrorists and criminal elements, gun runners, to keep the country—both our countries safe—Mexico and the United States safe.I also know that we need to deal with the people who are here—the 12 million people who are here illegally. I have said multiple times that we can't kick them out of our country. It doesn't make any sense to me to try to do that, and I don't think— maybe some feel that way, but I don't feel that way. But I also don't believe we should give them automatic amnesty—automatic citizenship, which I view as amnesty. And we look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans to have a comprehensive immigration plan.Energy is an opportunity for us to work together. We've done a lot of work in the past on promoting alternative sources of energy. America has done more than any nation in the world in promoting alternatives and renewables, all aiming to make sure our economy grows, that we have energy independence, and that we're good stewards of the environment. And I look forward to working with the Democrats on the energy independence initiative I laid out.One such initiative was the mandatory fuel standards that relies upon alternative fuel to power automobiles. Ethanol is the first and most notable place where we can start, but we also need to spend monies to develop technologies that will enable us to make energy out of products other than corn, switchgrass or wood chips, for example.The problem with relying only on corn is that—by the way, when your demand for corn stays high, the price tends to go up, and your hog farmer gets disgruntled with the alternative energy plan. And therefore, what's going to matter is that new technologies come on line as quickly as possible to take the pressure off of corn ethanol—or corn, as a result of being used in ethanol, and we can work with Congress to do that. That's an area we can work.Health care: I got a letter the other day from a group of Republican and Democrat Senators talking about the desire to work on health care. And they liked some of my ideas. But my only point is, is that there's an opportunity for us to work together to help the uninsured have private insurance so they can be—so they can get good health care. And there's an opportunity to work together there.The Governors are coming into town soon. And I'm going to have Secretary Leavitt describe to them the affordable grants program that is a part of our comprehensive approach, including rewriting the Tax Code.Finally, No Child Left Behind needs to be reauthorized. I fully understand that if you read your newspaper articles—which I do, sometimes—and listen carefully, you'll hear voices in both parties saying they don't like No Child Left Behind—it's too much testing, or we don't want to be held to account, or whatever they say. The bill is working. It makes a lot of sense.There's an income gap in America that I talked about when I went to Wall Street. And what's clear to me is that our kids have got to have education so that in this global economy, the jobs of the 21st century stay here at home. And it starts with good education. And therefore, I will argue vociferously that No Child Left Behind Act needs to be reauthorized—it's working; it's an important piece of legislation—and will reach out to Democrat Members, as well as Republican Members, to get this bill reauthorized.And so there's a lot of areas, Mike. I'd say it's a little early in the process. This is a 2-year term. We've got time to work together to get important pieces of legislation done. And I like the start. As a matter of fact, this afternoon I've got members of both parties, both Chambers coming down to visit about how we can continue to work together to get some legislation done.As I told the Democrats, and as the Democrats have made clear to me in my visits, that neither of us are going to abandon our principles, that I don't expect them to change their principles, and they shouldn't expect me to. But there's ways for us to work together to achieve legislative successes for the common good. That's what the American people want to see, and that's what I believe we can do. Is it going to take work? Yes, it's going to take work, but it's okay. That's why you pay us all this money.Richard [Richard Wolffe, Newsweek].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. My question goes to President Park. You just mentioned that North Korea—in order to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, what is most important is the concerted actions of the international community. With regard to this, during your meeting with President Obama today, I would like to ask what was said and the views that you shared. And with regard to this, what Russia and China—the role that they're playing in terms of inducing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, how do you feel about that?My next question is to President Obama. Regarding the young leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, I would appreciate your views about the leader of North Korea. And if you were to send a message to him today, what kind of message would you send to him? [SEP] With regard to the North Korea issue, Korea and the United States, as well as the international community, the ultimate objective that all of us should be adopting is for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and to induce it to become a responsible member of the international community. This serves the interest of peace on the Korean Peninsula and the world, and it also serves the interest of North Korea's own development as well. That is my view.And so in order to encourage North Korea to walk that path and change its perceptions, we have to work in concert. And in this regard, China's role, China's influence can be extensive, so if—so China taking part in these endeavors is important. And we shared views on that.With regard to China and Russia's stance, I believe that China and Russia—not to mention the international community, of course—share the need for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are cooperating closely to induce North Korea to take the right path. In the case of China, with regard to North Korea's missile fire and nuclear testing, China has taken an active part in adopting U.N. Security Council resolutions and is faithfully implementing those resolutions.And with regard to Russia, Russia is also firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And with regard to the adoption of U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, it has been very active in supporting them. And they've also sent a very—and they've also worked very hard to include a stern message to North Korea in the joint statement of the G-8 Foreign Ministers meeting. Such constructive efforts on the part of China and Russia are vital to sending a unified message to North Korea that their nuclear weapons will not stand, and encouraging and urging North Korea to make the right decision. Obviously, I don't know Kim Jong Un personally. I haven't had a conversation with him, can't really give you an opinion about his personal characteristics. What we do know is the actions that he's taken that have been provocative and seem to pursue a dead end.And I want to emphasize, and myself very much share the view that we are going to maintain a strong deterrent capability, that we're not going to reward provocative behavior. But we remain open to the prospect of North Korea taking a peaceful path of denuclearization, abiding by international commitments, rejoining the international community, and seeing a gradual progression in which both security and prosperity for the people of North Korea can be achieved.If what North Korea has been doing has not resulted in a strong, prosperous nation, then now is a good time for Kim Jong Un to evaluate that history and take a different path. And I think that, should he choose to take a different path, not only and myself would welcome it, but the international community as a whole would welcome it.And I think that China and Russia and Japan and other key players that have been participants in six-party talks have made that clear. But there's going to have to be changes in behavior. And we have an expression in English: Don't worry about what I say; watch what I do. And we're—so far at least, we haven't seen actions on the part of the North Koreans that would indicate they're prepared to move in a different direction.Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune].", "label": "Explicit"}

Congress typically shifts course when the public disapproves, but that hasn't happened, especially with Republicans, who lack urgency in creating jobs. I'll continue pushing for its passage, even if it takes until November or a new Congress. The bill includes tax cuts for the middle class, small businesses hiring veterans, and teachers, addressing issues like Hawaii's four-day school week due to budget cuts.

On Afghanistan, we're in a tough but crucial project. Remember why we're there: 9/11. We must dismantle Al Qaida and ensure Afghanistan never again attacks America. Afghanistan is poor with high illiteracy, ethnic mistrust, and weak governance. We're training Afghan security forces, promoting regional political settlement, encouraging a government that serves its people, and reducing corruption. We've made progress on corruption. Four years ago, 11 judges were indicted; this year, 86. Afghan-led efforts have targeted police and businesspeople. But we have far to go. I tell Karzai that long-term stability requires serving the Afghan people and reducing corruption. We'll keep pressing him. Will it happen overnight? No. Will our people compromise with corrupt individuals? We're reviewing that. You're right, Helene, we can't send mixed messages. My team must be consistent. If we publicly oppose corruption, our actions must match. It's challenging. On Netanyahu and the Middle East, the settlement moratorium is a major issue. Ironically, Palestinians were skeptical but it significantly reduced settlement construction. Now they see its importance. I told Netanyahu to extend it if talks progress constructively. The goal is for both sides to agree on borders. Then Israel can build in undisputed areas. Netanyahu's politics are difficult. His coalition opposes extension. I told Abbas to show the Israeli public he's serious so Netanyahu can extend the moratorium. I want them to help each other succeed.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, to be absolutely clear regarding the Senkaku Islands, if China were to initiate military action there, would the U.S. military intervene? Some perceive this as another 'red line,' potentially undermining U.S. credibility, similar to the situation with Syria. Also, concerning North Korea, are you cautioning them against further nuclear tests? And Prime Minister Abe, do you trust President Obama's security assurances, especially considering the West's inability to halt Russia's actions in Ukraine? [SEP] Well, let's unpack that a bit. There are several underlying assumptions I don't entirely agree with. The U.S.-Japan treaty predates my presidency; it's not a new 'red line' I'm establishing. It reflects the consistent interpretation across administrations that territories under Japanese administration fall under the treaty's purview. There's no policy shift here. However, I've stressed to Prime Minister Abe that escalating this issue is counterproductive. Dialogue and confidence-building between Japan and China are essential, and we'll actively encourage that diplomatically. Regarding international law, we believe nations should adhere to it. Violations occur when chemical weapons are used against civilians or when a country invades another's territory. The question implies that the U.S. must engage militarily every time such a violation occurs, or our commitment to these norms is questioned. That's not the case. We've removed 87% of Syria's chemical weapons through U.S. leadership, without military intervention. That's a success, not a failure. On Russia and Ukraine, a military solution isn't viable. We've imposed sanctions impacting the Russian economy and continue to pursue a diplomatic resolution. Russia initially showed promise of cooperation after the Geneva meetings, but has since failed to uphold the agreement, with militias destabilizing the region. Conversely, Kiev has taken concrete steps, including an amnesty law and constitutional reforms. If Russia continues to disregard the Geneva agreement, further consequences and sanctions will follow. These are complex issues, but we remain steadfast in our values and are prepared to act on them. Now, remind me of the North Korea question?", "label": "Clarification"}

We have been in discussions regarding the import of Russian gas into South Korea for quite some time. Currently, we are exploring the possibility with North Korea of allowing Russian gas, which is reasonably priced, to traverse their territory for use in South Korea. This is advantageous for Russia as they can sell their natural resources, for North Korea as they could utilize this natural resource, and for South Korea as well.

And do you think it's time for tough U.N. sanctions with real teeth, and are you confident that Russia and China would go ahead? [SEP] As you know, we have been discussing this issue a lot at these press avails. Iran is constantly on the agenda at a press avail like this—or a press conference like this, and the reason why is, is because they continue to be defiant as to the demands of the free world. The world has spoken and said, no nuclear weapons programs. And yet they're constantly ignoring the demands.My view is that we need to strengthen our sanction regime. I just spoke to Condoleezza Rice, and we will work with our European partners to develop further sanctions. And, of course, I will discuss this issue with Vladimir Putin as well as President Hu Jintao.The first thing that these leaders have got to understand is that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing for the world. It's in their interests that we work collaboratively to continue to isolate that regime.I'm sympathetic for the people of Iran. I'm sorry they live under a Government that continues to insist upon a program that the world has condemned, because it is denying the good people of Iran economic opportunities that they would have. This is a country with a great tradition and a great history. There are hard-working people in that country that want to benefit from a society that is more open, and yet the Government insists upon measures that will lead to further isolation.

Can France, for instance, help to get out of the Iraqi quagmire? And President Bush, where do you stand on Iraq and your domestic debate on Iraq? Do you have a timetable for withdrawing troops? [SEP] Yes. I don't—you know, quagmire is an interesting word. If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny, you'd be saying, God, I love freedom. Because that's what's happened. And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom. But freedom is happening in Iraq, and we're making progress.And I can't thank the President enough for sending his Foreign Minister to Baghdad. It was a clear message that freedom matters, that when people are struggling to live in freedom, that those of us who have the comfort of a free society ought to help them.We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands. I reminded a TV reporter—I don't know if the person is here or not— but I said, I just want to remind you that 1441 was supported by France and the United States, which clearly said to the dictator, you will disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. Now, I'm the kind of person that when somebody says something, I take them for their word.Having said that, we had a difference of opinion. But I don't sense any difference of opinion now that a struggling democracy wants help from those of us who live in the comfort of free societies. And, Mr. President, the strong gesture of sending your Foreign Minister there wasn't a message to the United States, because we're good friends; it was message to the Iraqi citizens that said: We hear your cries for freedom; we want you to succeed, because one of the lessons of history is, free societies yield peace.And so I appreciate your leadership on that issue, and I want to thank your Foreign Minister for—I don't see your Foreign Minister.

On , yes, we're worried about the situation. It's worrisome, and we need to have elections as swiftly as possible. You cannot combat extremism using the same methods as extremists, and it is very important, it is of the essence that organize elections. I, like President Bush, I wish this to take place as speedily as possible.Let me remind you that this is a country of 150 million inhabitants who happens to have nuclear weapons. This is very important for us that one day we shouldn't wake up with a government, an administration in which is in the hands of the extremists. And we should, each and every one of us, think about this, of the principles, the values that we uphold and that we defend and we must continue to uphold. And then there's the complexity, as it were, in the field. That's why it's important to convene election, call elections.Now, on Iraq, Bernard Kouchner's trip to Iraq was very successful. What does France want? A united Iraq. No one—no, it is in no one's interest to see Iraq dismantled. We want a democratic Iraq. We want a diverse Iraq, where each component element of Iraqi society has learned to live with others; an Iraq which is—which can administer and govern itself and that has the means of ensuring the peace and security of every one of its citizens.

I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don't even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is, when they knock down Grant—when they want to knock down Grant. But when they look at certain—now they're looking at Jesus Christ. They're looking at George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Not as long as I'm here.As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump administration. One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the Federal Government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump administration, considering his stance on immigration.And the second is, the administration and you have long maintained that the legal restraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander in Chief. Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump administration, is this now the time to, sort of, test that theory by moving the detainees and seeing where the chips end up lying? [SEP] Those are both excellent questions. On the deferred action program that we have, known as DACA, that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefiting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what for all practical purposes are American kids.I mean, these are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school. They have pledged allegiance to the flag. Some of them have joined the military. They've enrolled in school. By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character. And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again. And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at.With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing[]because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is, we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next 2 months.There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States. But because of the nature of the evidencein some cases, that evidence being compromisedit's very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court. And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us. My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We'd do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does as well. We will continue to explore options for doing that. But keep in mind that it's not just a matter of what I'm willing to do. One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you've got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President.I am very proud of the fact that we willknock on woodleave this administration without significant scandal. We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms and keeping trust with the American peopleI will put this administration against any administration in history.And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. And we had a strong White House Counsel's Office. We had a strong Ethics Office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things. It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it's supposed to, because we've got 2 million people working in the Federal Government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work. And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously as well. Again, you wouldn't know this if you were listening to some news outlets or some members of oversight committees in Congress. [] But if you actually look at the facts, it works.And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the Federal Government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing. You look at VA. People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix. It was scandalous what happened. What people don't remember is, is that we've brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren't getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half. Just made the agency work betternot work perfect, but work better.And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good. Perfect is unattainable. Better is possible.And so we will try to share the lessons that we've learned over these last 8 years with the incoming President. And my hope is, he makes things better. And if he does, we'll all benefit from it.All right? Thank you, everybody. You guys, some of you who are traveling, you'll get a chance to ask more questions.

[SEP] First and foremost, every soldier's death, be it in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere, is a profound loss, and our deepest sympathies go out to their families. We are immensely grateful for the willingness of Americans to volunteer and make sacrifices in these perilous times. Secondly, while June presented significant challenges in Afghanistan, the Taliban also faced considerable setbacks. The increase in casualties is partly attributable to our troops actively engaging a formidable adversary. This enemy opposes our presence because they reject the notion of America denying them a sanctuary. We are championing an ideology that stands in stark contrast to theirs, so resistance is inevitable. I maintain confidence in our strategy, which entails confronting the Taliban and Al Qaeda while simultaneously fostering a free society through effective economic, educational, and healthcare policies. We are continuously evaluating troop requirements and levels. We are currently at the midpoint of 2008, and as I have previously stated, we will augment troop numbers by 2009.

We prioritized the evacuation of American citizens and embassy personnel. Subsequently, we initiated the largest financial asset seizure in our history.

Just this week, the United States warned that if there is no phasing out of fossil fuels, it won't be possible to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. There was no agreement at the G-20 on fossil fuels. How concerned are you about this lack of consensus? [SEP] It wasn't so much an agreement that we would try to meet the goals at the G-20. The United States is going to meet those goals, by the way. We're going to exceed those goals. A lot of other countries are as well.But we want to give those countries that don't have the economic wherewithal and did not cause the problem in the first placefor example, I met with Lula in Brazil.I started off way back in the eighties with a really fine Republican Senator named Dick Lugar. We said: Here's what we're going to do. If you owe us money, we're going to forgive your debt if you maintain your forest. Because they become carbon sinks. They're the things that take carbon out of the air.And so we're talking to what we should be goand the countries that cleared their land and put cattle on there and farming and did all the things thatand increased development, they, in fact, are the onesthe reasons whythe main reason why we've gotten as far down the road to disaster here as we have.And so it seemsand if we have the economic capacity, wethose nations should be getting together and providing help for the nations that don't have the wherewithal to do it, the economic wherewithal and the infrastructure wherewithal.And that's why, for example, I mentionedin the interest of time, I'll just mention Angola again. Angola has the capacity to generate megawatts of energy through solar energy. They don't have the economic means to do that. Isn't it in the interest of the whole world if they are, in fact, able to generate significant capacity to absorbto prevent carbon from being released in the air? I think that it is.So what we're trying to do is help those nations. Theand particularly in the Global South, where they're not as wealthy, where there are not as many opportunities to be able to deal with the things that they want to deal with.For exampleand I'll end with thisthere is more carbon absorbed from the atmosphere on a daily basisand I'll look to mymy friend, John Kerry, who'd forgotten more about this than most people knowcorrect me if I get this wrong, John, but I'm quite sure I'm rightand that is that there's more carbon observed [absorbed; White House correction] from the air into the Amazon region into the groundthe groundthan emitted in the entire United States on the same basis.Now, imagine if people go in and do what we did 150, 200, 250 years ago and cut down the forest and thestart farming in that area, no longer have that great carbon sink. Weyou know, it's goingit would be a gigantic problem.So we should be going to areas, whether it's in the Congo or other places, as the G-7 nations and as the wealthy G-20 nations, theand providing the kind of infrastructure they need to be able to benefit.And guess what? In addition to helping the environment overalland the only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 2010 years. We'rethat'd be real trouble. There's no way back from that.And so there's a lot we can do in the meantime. For example, that pipelinethat railroad we're talking about going across from the middlefrom India, throughout the Middle East, and toacross the Mediterranean and all through Europe, that's going to have a hydrogen pipeline there. This is going to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted in the air, but it costs a lot of money to put that down. And the world is going to say it's in our interestcollective interest to do it.So I have notI have not given up at all on the notion that we're going to be able to, you knowhow can I say it? I think we can triple the renewable capacity foras it relates to global warmingby the year 20302030.Countries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passedthe clean energy jobs, they're going to create manufacturing jobs.For example, as a consequence of what we've done, we have the mostwe have the mostwe have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the worldin the world. Now, we've got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world.And one of the reasons we're doing itwe changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economythat is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well.Well, the truth of the matter is, I've never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with mejust flat, straight-out academic economistsand that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up.When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well.

That's a different issue.But all kidding asideso there'swe haveI think the other thing that's dawning on peoplemany of you who are foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time.

{"sentence": "Did President Carter's discussions with Hamas yield any positive outcomes? Did anyone in your administration discourage him from engaging with them? And will this affect your upcoming trip to the Middle East? [SEP] I didn't speak with him, so I honestly don't know. I have no idea what they talked about, and I don't see Hamas changing their ways. It's up to them to change. These meetings often result in empty promises. We've seen Hamas act as a destabilizing force for years. I supported the elections, and they won because they campaigned on anti-corruption. But they haven't delivered for the people in Gaza. My mission in the Middle East is to work with both Israelis and President Abbas on finding common ground and empowering Palestinians in the West Bank. There are some interesting initiatives in development. I'm still hopeful for an agreement by the end of my presidency. Condi is heading back there. I've been in touch with President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert. The attitude is positive. People understand the importance of defining a state. But when you're Israel and rockets are being fired into your country, you're going to respond. The question is, why is Hamas firing those rockets? They're trying to create chaos.

And if the U.S. won't cooperate with Russia if their aim is to keep Assad in power, is defeating ISIL a realistic goal? [SEP] Look, defeating ISIL remains our top priority, and we're exploring all options to achieve that goal. Russia's role in Syria is complex, and we need to see concrete evidence that they're genuinely focused on combating ISIL.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On Kuwait: So the Ambassador to—the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Austria this week told the IAEA that the Kuwaiti Government is very concerned over Iran's constant breaching of the JCPOA. In your discussions with the Kuwaitis today, have you discussed where they stand this week as we go into the U.N., as the United States tries to extend sanctions on Iran? [SEP] Well, they just left my office, as you know, the Oval Office. And we had a very good meeting with the Amir, and I think we understand each other very well. They're very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the Middle East. They are so excited that we signed the first two countries, and I think they'll end up fairly quickly being a part of it.I have, I would say, seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working very easily, very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. And not only is it happening, it's happening rather easily. We discussed that very briefly, because that's an easy one. Believe it or not, that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that's coming together very nicely.But we are talking to them and others about various aspects of the Middle East. The Middle East is straightening out with all this happening. You know, we've brought a lot of our troops back. A lot of them are coming back in the very near future.We're out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil. And we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we're out of Syria. We took them off the border between Syria and Turkey. We had a lot of troops on the border. Ultimately, we got it down to 50, and I thought they were in great danger when you have two armies sitting there looking to fight, and you have 50 people in the middle. I don't care who you are, even if you're the U.S., those 50 people are in great danger. We took them out.But we had a lot of troops on the border, and we took them out. I said, Look, they've been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that, under different names, and they can continue to do that. That's not for us; we're guarding our own borders. We're doing very well on our southern border, as an example.So we're out of Syria, except we kept the oil, and we'll make a determination. We'll probably be dealing with the Kurds and the oil and see what it all ends up. But we'll be out.And very importantly, we're down to very few soldiers in Iraq, and we're down—we'll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4,000—less than 4,000 in Afghanistan. And then we'll make that final determination a little bit later on.We're dealing very well with the Taliban. They're very tough, they're very smart, they're very sharp. But you know, it's been 19 years, and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness. And we really served as a police force, because if we wanted to do what we had to do, we would have fought a lot differently than they have over the 19 years. They didn't fight it properly. They were police, okay? They're not police; they're soldiers. So there's a difference. The police—nobody has more respect for police than I do, but they have to do their own policing.So we're having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It's been public. And—but we'll be down to—very shortly, we'll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. And so we'll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen—certain things have to be fulfilled. But 19 years is a long time, 8,000 miles away. Nineteen years is a long time.And the Middle East—the whole Middle East equation, if you look at what's happened, if you've looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made, including the deal that was made—I mean, take a look at what happened with Iran. Had that deal stayed and had I not broken that deal, you could have never done the deal that I'm doing now where all the countries are pouring in.And I had two calls this morning with countries; they want to know, When can we go into the deal? They want to go. It's not that we're giving them anything. They want security, they want peace, and they're really tired of fighting. It's incredible. They're tired of fighting. They've been fighting for so many years. They're tired of fighting. Thank you very much.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to specifically ask about the Dallas shooting and the attacker there. Now that we know more about the man who, we believe, did those crimes, I'm wondering if you could help us understand how you describe his motives. Do you consider this an act of domestic terrorism? Was this a hate crime? Was this a mentally ill man with a gun? How should Americans understand why that happened? And then, also, on the issue of political division and looking for solutions, there have been some critics who noted that you immediately mentioned your call for gun control soon after the attacks. Do you think that in any way encourages or ensures that people retreat to their corners as they think about this? [SEP] Yes. First of all, I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter. As we've seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled. By definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you—strangers—you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I'll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents.What I can say is that although he may have used as an excuse his anger about previous incidents—as has been indicated, at least, in the press, and as Chief Brown, I think, indicated—in no way does that represent what the overwhelming majority of Americans think.Americans, to a large degree, want to make sure that we have a police force that is supported, because they know our police officers do a really tough, dangerous job. And witness the professionalism of our Dallas police officers. As they were being shot at, the fact that they helped to clear the area, they helped to get the fallen and the injured out of there, they were able to isolate the suspect, and that you didn't have other casualties as a consequence of the police shooting back—that just gives you an indication of what a tough job they have and how well they do it on a regular basis.So I think the danger, as I said, is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country. It doesn't. When some White kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshippers who invite him to worship with them, we don't assume that somehow he's making a political statement that's relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn't make those assumptions around a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way.Now, with respect to the issue of guns, I am going to keep on talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight; we are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people; but we can make it harder for them to do so.And if you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we've experienced over the course of the last year or the last 5 years or the last 10 years—I've said this before—we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence that we experience. And I'm not just talking about mass shootings. I'm talking about the hundreds of people who have already been shot this year in my hometown of Chicago, the ones that we just consider routine.Now, we may not see that issue as connected to what happened in Dallas, but part of what's creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere. And as I said before, they have a right to come home, and now they have very little margin of error in terms of making decisions. So if you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can't set aside the gun issue and pretend that that's irrelevant.At the protest in Dallas, one of the challenges for the Dallas Police Department—as they're being shot at—is because this is an open-carry State, there are a bunch of people participating in the protest who have weapons on them. Imagine if you're a police officer and you're trying to sort out who is shooting at you and there are a bunch of people who have got guns on them.In Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused in some fashion those tragic events.So, no, we can't just ignore that and pretend that that's somehow political or the President is pushing his policy agenda. It is a contributing factor—not the sole factor, but a contributing factor—to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. And so we have to talk about that.And as I've said before, there is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is, even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization.And you're right, when it comes to the issue of gun safety, there is polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who actually think that we could be doing better when it comes to gun safety. But that expresses itself in stark terms when it comes to legislation in Congress or in State legislatures. And that's too bad. We're going to have to tackle that at some point. And I'm not going to stop talking about it, because if we don't talk about it, we're not going to solve these underlying problems. It's part of the problem.Carol Lee [Wall Street Journal].", "label": "Explicit"}

It represents a historic investment in combating climate change, and naturally, there will be some adjustments needed. For example, the provision regarding free trade agreements was intended to apply to our allies, not just those with formal agreements. We are committed to finding solutions that work for everyone. Our primary objective is to ensure that both the U.S. and Europe have secure and independent supply chains. We are open to making necessary adjustments to facilitate European participation. The intention was never to exclude those who are working with us. The goal is to avoid relying on other nations, as we experienced during the pandemic when China restricted the supply of computer chips.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding NSA surveillance, a judge noted the government couldn't prove it stopped imminent attacks using bulk metadata. Can you cite any instances where it did? Should this data collection continue? [SEP] Let me address this comprehensively, then focus on the specific program. My independent panel offered 46 recommendations after thorough review. I thanked them publicly for their diligent work. I tasked them with evaluating our structures and programs to ensure they balance security needs with rule of law, privacy, and civil liberties. We're assessing these recommendations and will announce definitive decisions in January. This will cover which recommendations we'll implement, refine, and how it relates to both internal and international efforts. I take this seriously, as this debate is crucial. The 215 program, involving bulk metadata collection, has drawn significant attention. The NSA believed, based on 9/11 experiences, that tracking calls to and from known terrorists was vital. This data, retained for a period, aided investigations. Reviews haven't shown NSA misuse of this data. However, public concern about potential abuse, echoed by the judge, is valid. We must determine if we can achieve the same goals while assuring the public of NSA's proper conduct. I trust the NSA isn't snooping domestically, but technology changes necessitate refinement to maintain public confidence. We must also reassure the international community. While we have laws and safeguards against spying on Americans, international constraints are less. In a virtual world, boundaries blur, and just because we can do something doesn't mean we should.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you've emphasized the need for banks to lend, their ingenuity in seeking profit, and your capacity to prevent them from excessive profits. How will you stop them from imposing these fees, and does the government have the authority to dictate the profit margins of American companies? [SEP] I absolutely do not think that. I was trying to make a broader point, which is that people have been using financial regulation as an excuse to charge consumers more. Right? I mean, basically the argument they've made is, well, you know what, this hidden fee was prohibited, and so we'll find another fee to make up for it. Now, they have that right, but it's not a good practice. It's not necessarily fair to consumers. And my main goal is to make sure that we've got a consumer watchdog in place who is letting consumers know what fair practices are, making sure that transactions are transparent, and making sure that banks have to compete for customers based on the quality of their service and good prices.Now, the frustrating thing that we have right now is that you've got folks over in Congress, Republicans, who have said that they see their role as eliminating any prohibitions on any practices for financial companies. And I think that's part of the frustration that the American people feel, because they've just gone through a period in which they were seeing a bunch of hidden fees, rate hikes that they didn't know about, fine print that they could not understand. That's true for credit cards. That's true for mortgages. It contributed to overall weakness in the economy.And yes, I think it is entirely appropriate for the Government to have some oversight role to make sure that consumers are protected. So banks--and any business in America--can price their products any way they want. That's how the free market works.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of the challenges facing Africa, what specific actions do you believe are most crucial for the continent's progress? What qualities should African leaders embody, and how can the United States best support Africa's transformation? Furthermore, what are your primary objectives for this five-nation tour, and why have you chosen to visit Africa near the end of your term? How do you intend to ensure the long-term impact of your initiatives? [SEP] Thank you. I actually went to Africa on the first lap of my Presidency too. This is my second trip to the continent of Africa, and I've come to remind our fellow citizens that it is in our interest to help countries deal with curable diseases like malaria and difficult diseases like HIV/ AIDS; that it's in our interest to promote trade between the continent of Africa and the United States of America; that it's in our interest to provide education money so governments will educate children. And there's no better way of making that point than to be in Ghana, where people will get to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to be giving speeches in America, it's another thing to actually come to Ghana and meet different folks that are involved with making the—Ghana a better place. Secondly, first of all, Africa has changed since I've been the President, in a very positive way. It's not because of me; it's because of African leaders—I want you to know. But there was six regional conflicts when I became the President. Take Liberia, for example. It was a real issue and a real problem, and along with Nigeria and with John's advice, for example, we—I made some decisions, along with other leaders, that helped put in place the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. And I'm going there tomorrow to herald the successes she's done and to reaffirm our commitment that we'll help. In other words, conflict resolution has been taking place. And the United States hasn't tried to impose a will. We've just tried to be a useful partner, like in eastern Congo, for example, working with the Presidents of Rwanda and Congo and Burundi. Secondly, democracy is making progress across the continent of Africa. One reason why is because there are examples like John Kufuor for people to look at. I'm telling you, the guy is a respected person. People look at him, and they say, this is the kind of leader that we respect. And thirdly, our aid program has changed from one that basically said, here's your money, good luck, to one that said, in return for generosity, we expect there to be certain habits in place, like fighting corruption or investing in the education of children. I don't think that's too much to ask in return for U.S. taxpayers' money. It hasn't been asked in the past. This is a novel approach, interestingly enough. But I feel confident in asking nations to adhere to good principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders. I'm confident in the capacity of the leaders I have met—not every single leader— but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy—a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent. And that's why I'm here, and I'm glad I am. It's been a great trip, and it's—and I appreciate the hospitality of my friend, and so does Laura. Let's see here, John McKinnon.

[SEP] You know, I think I finally figured it out last week. Just kidding! The learning curve is continuous. This is a truly unique job, unlike any other in the world. The constant flow of information and challenges is relentless. It's even more intense now due to the interconnectedness of the world. Back in the day, a crisis in Syria might not have even registered with the American public. Now, they see the images instantly. A financial meltdown in Asia used to be isolated; now it impacts our markets immediately. The sheer volume of information that any administration has to process and respond to is unprecedented. I saw a documentary about the Bay of Pigs; JFK had two weeks before it hit the news. Can you imagine? Today, a president has maybe an hour to formulate a response. These are the kinds of things I discussed with the President-elect. It was a frank and, I hope, valuable conversation. I tried to be as candid as possible about the challenges any incoming president faces. The most critical thing is your staff, especially your Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and White House Counsel. You need a system to gather information, generate options, and understand that the president ultimately makes the decisions. I've been fortunate to have some of the most intelligent, dedicated, and capable people in my administration. Their support has enabled me to make sound decisions. Without that, you'll be swamped. I hope he appreciated that advice. I also mentioned how encouraged I was by his post-election comments about unity and representing all Americans. His staffing choices, initial actions, and first impressions will be crucial. It takes time to assemble a team. But I emphasized that in such a divisive election, gestures matter.

And are we also taking rule of law and privacy seriously? We're evaluating all the recommendations. In January, I'll make a definitive statement about which recommendations make sense, which need refinement, and how it relates to our work internally and with other countries. I'm taking this very seriously because this is a debate that needed to be had. The 215 program, the bulk collection of phone data, has gotten the most attention. The NSA believed it was important to track calls from known terrorists outside the U.S. to the U.S. to investigate threats. There have been no allegations of inappropriate use of this data. But people are concerned about the possibility of abuse. We need to ask if we can accomplish the same goals in ways that give the public more confidence. I have confidence that the NSA is not snooping, but we may need to refine this further to give people more confidence. We also need to provide more confidence to the international community. We have a lot of laws to prevent the NSA from spying on Americans, but less constraint internationally. But in a virtual world, boundaries don't matter anymore, and just because we can do something doesn't mean we should. Our values need to apply beyond our borders.", "label": "Deflection"}

And so the question is, how can we have constructive dialog with our neighbors as to how to spread the benefits of investment?I also am reminding people that the United States taxpayer is most generous when it comes to bilateral aid. Since I've been the President, we've doubled the amount of annual bilateral aid to Latin America from $800 million a year to $1.6 billion a year. And most of the money is aimed at social justice programs, programs like education and health care.I also know full well that—and I saw this firsthand yesterday in Sao Paulo—that many American NGOs and faith-based groups and individuals express their concern about the plight of the poor through programs and activities all aimed at giving people a chance. Yesterday in Sao Paulo, we went to a pretty wealthy neighborhood, but it was surrounded by a . And there we found in the midst of hopelessness, there was a little center of love. And some of the program money had been raised as a result of concerts given in the United States, where citizens, average citizens, contribute to make sure this program remain viable.And so the trip is a—it's a statement of the desire to work together with people in our neighborhood. I've been to Central and South America a lot since I've been the President, because I fully understand a prosperous and peaceful neighborhood is in the interest of the United States of America.I would call our diplomacy quiet and effective diplomacy—diplomacy all aimed at helping people, aimed at elevating the human condition, aimed at expressing the great compassion of the American people.And, Mr. President, I appreciate you giving me a chance to come and visit with you, have a dialog about how we can advance our interests and the interests of our neighborhood. Concerning your question, the strategy for international insertion of Uruguay is quite well defined and quite clear. We are in favor of an open integration process; we are strongly in favor of the regional process. We are where we are, and we don't want to leave this place. And the trade we have and the cultural, historical relationships that we have with our brethren countries in the region are very solid, very strong. But we don't want a closed integration process, but an open integration process.This MERCOSUR should be able to integrate to other blocks or other countries of the world, and also each of the members of this process—for example, Uruguay— might be able to exercise its sovereign right of developing bilateral relations with other integration processes or other countries.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You talked about the payroll tax holiday and possibly extending that. Are you worried, though, that by adding a discussion of short-term measures on the economy into these discussions about long-term deficit reductions that that may complicate the conversation and make it harder to pass a debt limit? [SEP] I will--let me put it this way. If we've got a good deal on debt and deficit reduction that focuses not just on the 10-year window, but also the long term, we will get it done. And then we can argue about some other things, because I think that's very important.I will say that precisely because tough votes in Congress are often avoided, that it may make sense to also deal with something like a payroll tax cut at the same time, because it does have budget implications and the American people need to know that we're focused on jobs and not just on deficit reduction, even though, as I said, deficit reduction helps to serve the job agenda. I think they want to have some confidence that we've got a plan that's helping right now.But I don't think it should be a complicating factor, because if Mitch McConnell and John Boehner came to me and said, all right, we're ready to make a deal, here's a balanced approach to debt and deficit reduction, but we want to argue about payroll tax cuts later--they're not set to expire until the end of this year--if that was a situation that they presented, then I think we would have a serious conversation about that. I would not discount that completely.I do think that the steps that I talked about to deal with job growth and economic growth right now are vitally important to deficit reduction. Just as deficit reduction is important to grow the economy and to create jobs, well, creating jobs and growing the economy also helps reduce the deficit. If we just increased the growth rate by one percentage point, that would drastically bring down the long-term projections of the deficit, because people are paying more into the coffers and fewer people are drawing unemployment insurance. It makes a huge difference.And this may be sort of a good place to wrap up. You know, every day I get letters from folks all around the country who show incredible resilience, incredible determination, but they are having a very, very tough time. They're losing their homes. Some have lost their businesses. Some have lost work and have not been able to find jobs for months, maybe a year, maybe a year and a half. And they feel some desperation. And some folks who are working just are having a tough time paying the bills because they haven't seen their wages or incomes go up in 10 years, and the costs of everything else have gone up.And every day that weighs on me. Every minute of every day that weighs on me. Because I ran for President precisely to make sure that we righted this ship and we start once again creating a situation where middle class families and people who aspire to be in the middle class, if they're working hard, then they're living a better life.Now, these structural changes in our economy that have been going on for a decade--in some cases, longer--they're not going to be solved overnight. But we know what to do. We know that if we are educating our kids well, then they're going to be more competitive. We know that if we are investing in things like infrastructure, it pays off.I was in Alcoa, in Iowa, one of our most successful companies. They took a big hit during the recession, but they still invested $90 million in new equipment in a plant that makes airplane wings and parts for automobiles. And they've bounced back. They've hired back all their people and are increasing market share because they made those investments.Well, just like a company like Alcoa, America has got to make some investments. We know that we've got to get control of our deficit. There are some things that aren't going to solve all our problems but can make progress right now. And the question is whether or not Democrats and Republicans are willing to put aside the expedience of short-term politics in order to get it done.And these folks are counting on us. They desperately want to believe that their leadership is thinking about them and not playing games. And I think that if all the leadership here in Washington has the faces and the stories of those families in mind, then we will solve this debt limit issue, we will put in place steps like a payroll tax cut and infrastructure development, we'll continue to fund education, we'll hold true to our commitment to our seniors.These are solvable problems, but it does require us just getting out of the short-term and frankly selfish approach that sometimes politics breeds.

Is it due to pressure from President Trump, or did you simply fail to convince him otherwise? And do you expect the other nations involved to support this new agreement? [SEP] Let me be clear: my 'no Plan B' comment referred to the lack of a second planet, a point about climate change, not Iran. Regarding Iran, my position has been consistent. As I stated at the UN, the JCPOA needs to be supplemented with elements addressing post-2025 issues, ballistic missiles, and regional influence. The JCPOA's fate is uncertain, and that's his decision. I view it as a foundation, not the complete solution. I'm not suggesting a replacement, but an enhancement. I wouldn't be as critical of the JCPOA as he is, because I think we can usefully add to it. Regardless, my goal is to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement encompassing the JCPOA's provisions, extended nuclear restrictions, ballistic missile controls, and regional influence mitigation. We've discussed regional dynamics, especially in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, recognizing the interconnectedness of nuclear and ballistic issues, and Iran's regional presence. Our shared aim is regional stability. This agreement sets the stage for a new agreement addressing the Syrian conflict. I hope to work with our partners, and our foreign ministers are actively involved. We will also discuss regional issues, including Syria, with Russia and Turkey. I believe we can reconcile our common ground and differences. Abandoning the JCPOA without a replacement would be a mistake. Instead, we should build upon it to address all concerns. This acknowledges the criticisms of the JCPOA, which was supported by previous administrations. It also respects regional sovereignty, focusing on a stable framework for peace. It's not about tearing about an agreement and have nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns. And if I might add, they—states and, as I alluded to—that—and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost. The United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before—and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to—$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, Oh, we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things—tunnels, bridges—they say, Oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period. The countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important—because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that. But there is a chance—and nobody knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea—but we'll see. But we'll see also, if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations. Because this a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal. It's a bad structure. It's falling down. Should have never, ever been made. I blame Congress. I blame a lot of people for it. But it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th. But I will say, if Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid. Okay?

{"sentence": "Q. Next question, sir. The issue is inflation. TheGrio and KFF conducted a study of Black voters that said inflation was the number-one issue, and we saw it in this midterm election. What can you promise concretely in these next 2 years that will help turn the pocketbook for the better in the midst of staving off a recession? [SEP] Well, a number of things. First of all, Black unemployment is almost cut in half under my administration just since I began. More Black businesses have opened up—small businesses—than ever before.We're now in a situation where we're providing, through the Small Business Administration, downpayments for people buying homes, because most people accumulate wealth in the value of their home, most middle class families like mine. My dad bought a home, didn't have—just scraped together to get a home. By the time he was able to retire, he was—he had built up equity in a home. That's how most people do that.And so—but what I can't do is, I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to get rid of inflation, but I do think we can. We brought—we've already brought down the price of gasoline about $1.20 a gallon across the board. And I think that the oil companies are really doing the Nation a real disservice. They've made—six of them made over $100 billion in the last quarter in profit. A hundred billion dollars.In the past, if they had done the two things that they had done before—one, invest in more refineries and producing more product and/or passing on the rebates to the gas stations that—you know, they sell the oil at a cheaper rate than they have to sell—than they are selling it now, not taking advantage. And that lowers the price of the total gallon of gas because that gets passed on.So there's a whole lot of things that we can do that are difficult to do, but we're going to continue to push to do them.And the other thing is that one of the things that makes a gigantic difference is what are the costs that exist in the average family and the average Black community. One, prescription drug costs. Well, we're driving those down precipitously, beginning next year.And you know, I'll bet you know a lot of people in the African American and Caucasian community that need to take insulin for diabetes. Well, we're going to reduce that cost. They're not going to pay more than $35 for the insulin instead of four—average of $400.And I can go down the list of the things that—my dad used to say it a different way. At the end of the month, the things you have to pay for, from your mortgage to food on the table to gasoline in the automobile, do you have enough money to do it? And when it's done, do you have anything left over? And medical bills are a big piece of that, particularly in the African American community and the poor—and poorer communities. They need help.And so we're driving down all of those costs. And we've already passed the legislation to do that; it's just taking effect. So there's a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living.And so—but I am optimistic, because we continue to grow and at a rational pace, we're not anywhere near a recession right now, in terms of the growth. But I think we can have what most economists call a soft landing. I'm convinced that we're going to be able to gradually bring down prices so that they, in fact, end up with us not having to move into a recession to be able to get control of inflation.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. So why were you so definitive? Why did you say we struck the right balance? [SEP] So the point is, Ed, not that my assessment of the 215 program has changed in terms of technically how it works. What is absolutely clear to me is that given the public debate that's taken place and the disclosures that have taken place over the last several months, that this is only going to work if the American people have confidence and trust.Now, part of the challenge is, is that because of the manner in which these disclosures took place, in dribs and drabs, oftentimes shaded in a particular way, and because of some of the constraints that we've had in terms of declassifying information and getting it out there, that that trust in how many safeguards exist and how these programs are run has been diminished. So what's going to be important is to build that back up. And I take that into account in weighing how we structure these programs.So let me just be very specific on the 215 program. It is possible, for example, that some of the same information that the intelligence community feels is required to keep people safe can be obtained by having the private phone companies keep these records longer and to create some mechanism where they can be accessed in an effective fashion.That might cost more. There might need to be different checks on how those requests are made. There may be technological solutions that have to be found to do that. And the question that we're asking ourselves now is, does that make sense not only because of the fact that there are concerns about potential abuse down the road with the metadata that's being kept by a government rather than private companies, but also, does it make sense to do it because people right now are concerned that maybe their phone calls are being listened to, even if they're not? And we've got to factor that in.So I—my point is, is that the environment has changed in ways that I think require us to take that into account. But the analysis that I've been doing throughout has always been periodically looking at what we're doing and asking ourselves, are we doing this in the right way? Are we making sure that we're keeping the American people safe, number one? Are we also being true to our civil liberties and our privacy and our values?", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President Bush, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has been using his country's vast oil wealth to court a whole new generation of Latin Americans. You pretty much avoided using his name. He certainly used yours a lot, including saying earlier today, Go home, gringo. Do you think a visit to Latin America and agreements like the one you forged today will help counter his influence or just give him more ammunition?And to President Lula da Silva, were you able to persuade President Bush to help you on getting our Congress to lower the sugar ethanol tariffs? [SEP] I'll answer that one for him; he can answer it too. It's not going to happen. The law doesn't end until 2009; then the Congress will accept it—will look at it when the law ends.You may want to expand on that answer.As to my trip, I bring the good will of the United States to South America and Central America. That's why I'm here. I don't think America gets enough credit for trying to help improve people's lives. And so my trip is to explain, as clearly as I can, that our Nation is generous and compassionate; that when we see poverty, we care; that when we see illiteracy, we want to do something about it; that when we find there to be a deficiency in health care, we'll help to the extent we can.I'm sure most people here in South America don't understand the United States has doubled our bilateral aid to countries in Central and South America since I've been the President. It's gone from 800 [$800 million] * to 1.6 billion last year. And I say that not to just brag about dollars, but it's a starting point for people to understand this Nation is committed to this prospect. A prosperous neighborhood is in the interest of the United States; a peaceful neighborhood is in our interests.And so we fully understand that if there's illiteracy, it will affect our country eventually. Plus, the American people have got a great compassion for human rights and human dignity. I'm going to go see some programs here after this press conference, all aimed at lifting the lives of citizens, all aimed at focusing on individuals and how best can they be helped.There is a lot of investment in the region, as the President noted. Oh, for some, that's just a fancy word, but for others who benefit from the investment through jobs, it's a central part of their life. And so my trip down here is to remind our country that South America and Latin America are good places to invest, particularly in countries that adhere to rule of law and are transparent and believe in the fundamentals of freedom.And so I'm reminding people that which is pretty evident, that a lot of people know that there are direct ties between our countries. There's a lot of remittances from the United States back to the region. Why? Because there are people working for a living in our country that are sending money home to support their families. So this trip is to remind people of the ties that bind us and the importance of this region for the future of the United States. And I'm real glad to be here, and I appreciate the hospitality.Get another question moving.", "label": "Explicit"}

That's the President's job. But getting things done requires bipartisan cooperation, which the elections showed. We had a successful few years legislatively. We reformed Medicare, created pro-growth tax policies, passed trade deals, and a comprehensive energy bill. I'm signing another energy bill today, extending R&D tax credits. It's a strong record. But with Democrats in charge, we need a different approach. I'll work with their leaders and our own to find common ground on Social Security and immigration. We must pass comprehensive immigration reform this year. To secure our border, Border Patrol needs a plan allowing temporary legal work for those doing jobs Americans won't. Recent enforcement actions at packing plants showed many illegal workers using forged documents. This system forces people to rely on smugglers and forgers. It's inhumane. The best way to enforce our borders humanely is with comprehensive reform. I've proposed a plan and spoken about it from the Oval Office. The 'microphone' is vital to rally action. I want to work with both parties. On energy, we can also cooperate. There's consensus on researching alternative energy. We're making progress. I want to work with them. Some say losing Congress means nothing will get done. I disagree. I want to get things done, and Democratic leaders want to prove their leadership.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with oil prices soaring above $118 a barrel, a record high, are Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations acting as adversaries? Have your recent appeals to these countries yielded any positive results? Moreover, won't the escalating gasoline prices effectively nullify the intended effects of the economic stimulus package? [SEP] Well, there's no question that rising gasoline prices are a significant concern for working families. The reality is that we've had an energy policy that has, for too long, neglected the development of domestic energy resources, particularly hydrocarbons. As a result, we're now facing the consequences of that neglect. We should have been exploring for oil and gas in areas like ANWR, but Congress consistently prevented us from opening up new areas for environmentally responsible exploration. This has made us increasingly reliant on foreign sources of oil. Fortunately, we have strong partnerships with Canada and Mexico, who are our largest suppliers, and we're grateful for their contributions. However, the fact remains that our energy policy has not been as effective as it should have been, and we're now seeing the repercussions. Furthermore, there's a limited amount of spare capacity in the global oil market, and unfortunately, much of the supply is coming from regions that are politically unstable. Again, Canada and Mexico are exceptions to this. Some countries are not reinvesting in their reserves, which leads to a decline in production. I'm deeply concerned about the impact of rising gasoline prices on American consumers. That's why it's so important that we passed the tax relief package, and it's equally important that Congress make those tax cuts permanent. Some are advocating for tax increases on the wealthy, but that simply won't generate enough revenue to satisfy their spending appetites. Inevitably, those types of tax schemes end up burdening middle-class families. In a time of economic uncertainty, we need tax certainty. With gasoline prices on the rise, we need to send a clear message to the American people that we're not going to raise their taxes.", "label": "Implicit"}

I'll tell you what has a significant impact on charitable giving, is a financial crisis in an economy that's contracting.

President Obama, what are your views on Kim Jong Un, and what message would you send him today? [SEP] Regarding North Korea, our shared goal, along with the international community, is denuclearization and their becoming a responsible member of the global community. This benefits peace on the Korean Peninsula and the world, as well as North Korea's own development. To encourage this, we must work together. China's influence is significant, making their participation crucial. We discussed this. China and Russia, along with the international community, share the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are cooperating to guide North Korea. China has actively participated in adopting and implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea's missile launches and nuclear tests. Russia is also committed to denuclearization and has actively supported U.N. resolutions. They also worked to include a strong message to North Korea in the G-8 Foreign Ministers meeting statement. These efforts are vital to sending a unified message that their nuclear weapons are unacceptable and urging them to make the right choice. I don't know Kim Jong Un personally and can't comment on his character. However, his actions have been provocative and lead to a dead end. We will maintain a strong deterrent and not reward provocative behavior. However, we are open to North Korea pursuing denuclearization, abiding by international commitments, rejoining the international community, and achieving security and prosperity for its people. If North Korea's current path hasn't led to a strong, prosperous nation, now is the time for Kim Jong Un to change course. If he does, we and the international community would welcome it.

{"sentence": "Q. My name is—[inaudible]—of SBS. I have a question for President Park. Madam President, last month at Dresden, Germany, you have announced your unification initiative centering around the three main proposals for laying the groundwork for peace and unification, but North Korea flatly rejected it and has continued with its threats of provocation. In particular, North Korea is showing signs for an attempt at the fourth nuclear test against this backdrop. The two leaders said that there will be—at their opening statements—strong sanctions and against—posed against North Korea by the international society, and they will not—the two countries will not tolerate a nuclear test.I would like to know what the President's evaluation is. Is there a possibility of North Korea actually carrying out the nuclear test? And if the provocations continue, if you are to improve and move forward in the Korean relations, are you considering a more flexible measure to be taken against the North? Nextly, with regards to the U.S.-Korea transfer of the wartime command or the OPCON, the two leaders have said that they will review the timing and conditions for transfer. And if the transfer schedule is pushed back again, have you discussed with the President Obama specifically on when that timing will be? [SEP] Yes. At the Korean Government and also at the Defense Ministry, our assessment is that the North Korea is actually fully ready to carry out the fourth nuclear test, so it can actually carry out the test whenever it deems necessary. That is our assessment. We're not very certain of what the timing will be, but I think we believe that they are fully ready now.And this is a very tense situation. To come up with some flexible measure—that is your question—actually, the Dresden initiative is a case in point for a win-win of the two Koreas and for improvement of the quality of life for the North Korean residents. It's indeed a flexible policy. But the North Korea is responding with threats of provocation and about carrying out North Korea—to carry out nuclear tests. So this is a point that we really need to think seriously.With regards to the transfer of the OPCON, Korea and the United States have decided that the basic direction should be to strengthen the KORUS, combine the defensive posture. We believe that it should not incur any negative situations on the defense posture for the Korea. And therefore, against the heightening tensions of the threats currently, the timing is 2015. But we have agreed that we could revisit this issue about reviewing the timing and conditions for transfer.So, currently, I don't think it is quite appropriate that I give you exact timing or the conditions.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. Is the coming election a referendum on Iraq? Should it be? [SEP] I think the coming election is a referendum on these two things: Which party has got the plan that will enable our economy continue—to continue to grow, and which party has a plan to protect the American people. And Iraq is part of the security of the United States. If we succeed—and when we succeed in Iraq, our country will be more secure. If we don't succeed in Iraq, the country is less secure.The security of this country—and look, I understand here in Washington, some people say we're not at war. I know that. They're just wrong, in my opinion.The enemy still wants to strike us. The enemy still wants to achieve safe haven from which to plot and plan. The enemy would like to have weapons of mass destruction in order to attack us. These are lethal, coldblooded killers. And we must do everything we can to protect the American people, including questioning detainees or listening to their phone calls from outside the country to inside the country. And there was—as you know, there was some recent votes on that issue. And the Democrats voted against giving our professionals the skill—the tools necessary to protect the American people.I will repeat, like I've said to you often: I do not question their patriotism; I question whether or not they understand how dangerous this world is. And this is a big issue in the campaign. Security of the country is an issue, just like taxes are an issue. If you raise taxes, it will hurt the economy. If you don't extend the tax cuts, if you don't make them—in other words, if you let the tax cuts expire, it will be a tax increase on the American people.Take the child tax credit. If it is not made permanent—in other words, if it expires—and you got a family of four sitting around the breakfast table, the taxpayers can be sure that their taxes will go up by $2,000: 500 for that child, 500 for the one right there, 500 for this one, and 500 for that one. That is a tax increase. And taking $2,000 out of the pockets of the working people will make it harder to sustain economic growth.So the two issues I see in the campaign can be boiled down to, who best to protect this country and who best to keep taxes low.

The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates—what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors. That's why AARP has endorsed us. Okay.", "label": "Implicit"}

We're now in April, and we've yet to see this disclosure. There are continued negotiations, a new round next week. Are you concerned that, given this record, they're not prepared to make this full disclosure, that they're stalling the process somehow? And if so, a question for both of you: How do you respond to that? [SEP] Yes, of course. I mean, they may be trying to stall. One thing about a nontransparent society where there's not a lot of free press, for example, or a lot of opposition voices, it's hard to tell what's going on.

And the only thing I know to do is to continue pressing forward within the six-party framework.The decision—we've made our decision. We, the five of us, have made our decision, and that is, there's a way forward. And obviously, we hope he chooses to honor his commitments in a verifiable way. But it's—when you're dealing with a society in which it's hard to get information out of, you just have to wait and see whether they're sincere or not. Unlike our society, of course, where there's all kinds of people in the administration talking and sharing information with you—some of it authorized, some of it's not—it doesn't happen that way in . It's a closed society. It's a society in which the will of one person decides the course of the future.And again, we're very hopeful. We talked about our mutual desire to keep the six-party framework in place to deal with a lot of issues. The first one, of course, is with . And it's—I can just tell you, Steven Lee, it's much more effective to have more than one voice speaking on this issue than to be the sole voice speaking on the issue. And so if it—if there ever is going to be a breakthrough, it's through the six-party framework.And look, I'm hopeful. We'll see. This has been a—I've been at this for quite a while. And there's been moments where it looked like the process was going to go very smoothly and everybody's going to honor their commitments, and then for one reason or another, there's a—there was a setback. But the key thing is, is that we haven't abandoned the efforts to solve this problem peacefully and diplomatically. Thank you. If you correctly understand and if you do understand n society, you'll probably get a better picture of why we are seeing some delay in the process at the moment. If wasn't like that, then we would have seen the resolvement of this issue already. We need persistent patience, ladies and gentlemen. And we need time in order to have complete resolution of this issue.However, it's difficult to convince to give up their nuclear weapons program, but it's not impossible. It is not impossible. I believe that. So in order to resolve this issue, I believe that the six-party talks is the most effective way and mechanism to resolve this issue, like the President mentioned. And right now we're in the stages of waiting for their declaration, and then we can move on to the verification process.So I think it's up to you to make the atmosphere so that can faithfully abide by their promise and make the right declaration, that once does so, it is also in their interest to make the correct decision to give a full and complete declaration.

President Bush, what is your opinion about the way in which the government has handled the scandal of the politicians involved in drug trafficking because—and the paramilitaries?— because we know that there are many more members involved with the paramilitaries. Up to what extent do you support President Uribe given the fact that most of these paramilitary heads are drug traffickers? And finally, the U.S. will insist on extraditing these people? [SEP] I support a plan that says that there will be an independent judiciary analyzing every charge brought forth, and when someone is found guilty, there's punishment. That's the kind of plan I support. It happens to be the kind of plan the President supports. In other words, there's no political favorites when it comes to justice, that if someone is guilty, they will pay a penalty. And the best way to assure that that penalty is fair and the justice is fair is for there to be a court independent from politics.And so when I asked this very same question to the President about the news I've been reading in Washington, DC, the same questions he's going to be asked when he and his government come to talk to our Congress, he answered just like I described. He said: We have an independent court. We've got a firm law. People will be held to account, whether or not they're—no matter what political party they may or may not be associated with. That's what the people of Colombia expect; that's the kind of justice they're going to receive.Listen, this country has come through some very difficult times.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given John Howard's focus on climate change at APEC, haven't you undermined his efforts with your Washington meeting? And how relevant do you consider Kyoto to be in addressing climate change? [SEP] Let's address the latter first. As I age, I might need reminders. Kyoto might suit others, but it didn't for the U.S. I was honest about that. Before my D.C. trip, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected Kyoto, 95-0. It wasn't just my view. We pursued a different path: energy efficiency via new tech. We cut greenhouse gases last year while our economy grew by 3%. Not many can claim that. Our tech-focused strategy works. I believe we can reduce foreign oil dependency. As an energy exporter, that might worry some. We have a '20-in-10' plan to cut gasoline use by 20% in 10 years using ethanol and new tech. Battery tech will let Sydney drivers go 40 miles on battery without a golf cart look. New tech is coming. The key is getting it to market fast. Kyoto didn't do that for us. Look at who's meeting Kyoto targets; a different approach might be better. We rejected Kyoto because it hindered our goals: economic growth, less foreign oil, environmental stewardship. John and I discussed his APEC climate change focus, and I supported it. At the G-8, I stressed the need to include everyone, like China and India, in climate change solutions. Otherwise, they might reject imposed solutions. Global climate change efforts need China. The Prime Minister's protocol was smart, aiming to cut tariffs on clean coal tech exports to China. He wants to remove barriers, and we support him. Key questions: How fast can we get effective tech to market—coal sequestration, nuclear reprocessing? Can we help developing nations acquire them? Otherwise, it's ineffective. Our strategy is the most effective. I appreciate the Prime Minister's focus on energy dependency and efficiency, which are part of the climate mix.

[SEP] Well, let's address the facts. They are holding three prisoners, and we are actively engaged in negotiations to secure their release. They have been held for an extended period and subjected to harsh treatment. We worked tirelessly to bring Otto Warmbier home, but tragically, he was in very poor condition. We are equally committed to bringing these three American citizens back home. I am optimistic about our chances. We are maintaining a productive dialogue and will keep you informed of our progress.

But as you know, I had long conversations with my friend, and they were very nice. So I am very satisfied. And we just discussed the same conversation with the President. We're very satisfied. Thank you. As far as the topic of tariffs is concernedtariffs following the WTO decision on the EU's contribution, or the subsidies to the Airbus consortiumI already mentioned what our belief is. Let me repeat it:I think that within the transatlantic relationship, and with the friendship that there has always been between the U.S. and the EU, it would be preferable to discuss our respective positions so that we can find a solution which takes into account the requirements of both parties. And that's wholly possible.The alternative would be that of imposing tariffs. Currently, following the WTO's decision concerning Airbus, wethere may be tariffs. And there may be tariffs in 6 months' time concerning the subsidies given to Boeing. This is a mere race between tariffs and mutual tariffs. I think it would be best to meet and to deal with our mutual needs so that a solution can be found.But if we don't do this now, it will have to be done soon. And I believe it would be best to find a solution immediately, instead of imposing tariffs, which would lead to other tariffs, and that would be a damage to both our economies. Well, actually, the tariff situation is interesting because we justit's like I said with China, and it turned out to be truewe cannot lose a war of tariffs because the imbalance is so great between the United States and, in this case, the European Union. Also true with China. That turned out to be right. We've collected tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We've given some to the farmers, to make them even. And now the farmers are going to have a bigger contract than they ever thought possible. They won't be able to produce even that much, but I think they will, because they're incredible, ingenious. As I say, jokingly, but probably not jokingly: They'll just have to buy larger tractors, which is probably what they're doing right now. But the farmers come out so well.But in a war of tariffs with the European Union, the trade imbalance is so great that we can't lose that, because they do much more business than we do, and that's unfortunate. But the word reciprocity is probably my favorite word. Of all of these words, all of the semicomplicated, complicatedto me, not complicated at allthings that we're doing, it's got to be reciprocal, and it's not.The European Union has taken tremendous advantage of the United States. Many of us come throughone way or the otherthrough the European Union. That's the good news. The bad news is they've been very smart. They've been very smart. Jean-Claude has been brilliant. Now he's leaving, but he's beenhe's been brilliant at really helping them and not helping us.And so that's changing now. But we can't lose that particular war of tariffs, because the trade imbalance is tremendous. It's tremendous. And if you look at what they don't havethe barriers that they put up; they put up tremendous barriers to our doing business in Europetremendous barriersboth from a monetary standpoint and what they call nonmonetary barriers.It's a very tough thing. Our farm products, very hard to get them in. Our cars, very hard to get them in. And yet they send Mercedes. They send BMW. Then they send Volkswagen; Renault, in the case of France.

Four years ago, in a press conference, Mr. President Karzai said Taliban do not pose any threat to Afghan people. So who do you think supported Taliban to threaten the security by doing kidnapings and attacking the Government officials, and why? [SEP] Four years ago, I did say that, and I continue to say that. The Taliban do pose dangers to our innocent people; to children going to school; to our clergy; to our teachers; to our engineers; to international aid workers. They are not posing any threat to the Government of Afghanistan; they are not posing any threat to the institutions of Afghanistan or to the buildup of institutions of Afghanistan. It's a force that's defeated; it's a force that is frustrated; it's a force that is acting in cowardice by killing children going to school.Who is supporting them is a question that we have been working on for long time and since then. And I hope that the jirga between us and Pakistan will give us solutions to some of the questions that we have. One thing is for certain: We know the vision—their vision of how to govern. They've been in power. They've had the opportunity to show the world how they think and what they do. I mean, it'd be instructive for people to speak to a mother of a young girl about what life was like under the Taliban. These are brutal, coldblooded killers. Yes. That's what they are. And the fundamental question facing those of us who believe in freedom is whether or not we confront them, and whether or not it's worth it—the effort—to spread an alternative to their hateful vision. And I— we've come to the conclusion it is. And that's why President Karzai stands right here at Camp David, discussing common concerns, common opportunities, about how to defeat a vision of darkness. That's what they are. They just don't believe in freedom. They don't believe it's possible to live in a society where people are allowed to express themselves in free fashion.And it's really part of an ongoing challenge that the free world faces.

[SEP] Well, those details are still being ironed out. We're definitely considering another meeting, or perhaps we'll call it a dialogue, to keep things fresh. The progress we've made has honestly exceeded my expectations. To be frank, I didn't anticipate reaching this point so quickly. I cautioned against raising hopes prematurely, suggesting that a successful initial meeting would involve establishing a rapport and setting the stage for this level of progress in a few months. However, things moved swiftly, largely due to the groundwork laid beforehand. For example, the repatriation of remains wasn't initially on the agenda. I raised it towards the end, prompted by numerous inquiries. Chairman Kim responded graciously, agreeing to proceed immediately, recognizing the significance of honoring those who served. This gesture will bring solace to many. So, yes, we're moving forward.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. You have set the target before leaving the White House that, by the end of this year, you will, hopefully, achieve an historical peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. However, in light of what's happening to the fragile position of Ehud Olmert—Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the continuous process of building illegal settlements in the—in eastern Jerusalem and certain parts of the occupied territories, do you think that peace is far away right now in light of those obstacles? [SEP] Yes. Thank you. First of all, I view the concept of a Palestinian state and the idea of a Palestinian state for Israeli security, as well as Palestinian security and hope, as bigger than the political process. And I fully recognize there's a lot of uncertainty in the Israeli political scene now.On the other hand, what is not uncertain is that most people—or many people in Israel understand that for their own security, there has to be a Palestinian state with clearly defined borders, a state that doesn't look like Swiss cheese, a resolution of the refugee issue and the security issue, and of course, issues surrounding Jerusalem.Most Palestinians want to coexist in peace with Israel. And that peace must be in a state that is clearly visible, well-defined, and in actuality is a state. And so in other words, the concept—and by the way, this is newly arrived. I'm actually the first President ever to have articulated a two-state solution, two democracies living side by side with peace—in peace. And during my time as President, I've seen a notable shift amongst folks in the Middle East that recognize the importance of having that state.So my point to you is, is that, you know, it's been a—there's always difficulties in democracies, but the notion is a—of getting this work done is important. And therefore, our diplomacy is to remind all the parties involved that they have now an opportunity to get a state negotiated. And I think it can be done by the end of the year. Condi is very much involved with it on a—you know, a nearly weekly, it seems like, basis. And of course, I'm in touch with the leaders. The Palestinians are discouraged by the settlement activity—all the more reason to get the borders clearly defined as quickly as possible.I want to thank Nicolas and the EU, for example, for helping build civil society in the Palestinian Territory as well as helping Prime Minister Fayyad with security measures.I'll also remind you that it's essential that we get a state defined as quickly as possible so that leaders such as President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad can say to their people, here's an alternative vision to what's taking place in Gaza. You support us, and you're going to get a state. You support Hamas, and you're going to get Gaza. Take your pick.And therefore, there it's imperative that we, you know, convince the parties to get this done. Now, I know some say, All America has got to do is say, 'Do it.' No, the way it works is, is that the parties have got to come to this agreement. Our job, along with the EU through the Quartet, is to keep the process moving.And so I'm optimistic. I understand how difficult it is, but difficulty should not cause people to do the right thing. If you believe in your soul something is right, then you have an obligation to work. And in this case, I firmly believe that the establishment of the Palestinian state will bring hope and peace to the Israelis and the Palestinians.Thank you.", "label": "General"}

This isn't my first trip to Africa; I came early in my presidency too. I'm here to emphasize that it's in our interest to help Africa fight diseases, promote trade, and invest in education. Ghana is a perfect example. It's one thing to talk about it in America, it's another to see it on the ground. Africa has changed for the better since I took office, thanks to African leaders. We've seen conflict resolution, like in Liberia, where we helped install the first democratically elected female president. We're a partner, not an imposer. Democracy is progressing, thanks to leaders like John Kufuor. Our aid program now requires accountability, like fighting corruption and investing in education.

I don't know the man personally, but there are clearly some serious issues. The WHO has been incredibly unfair to the United States, much like the World Trade Organization. They're starting to realize that now, though. How is it that China is still considered a developing nation, allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. on a massive scale? Why didn't previous presidents address this? I've been talking about it since day one, and we're taking a hard look at it.

We've confirmed North Korea's involvement and are evaluating a range of options.

{"sentence": "President Bush, if your administration's rhetoric fails to strengthen the dollar, will you resort to intervention? Furthermore, what are your thoughts on the Saudi Arabian proposal for a summit concerning energy prices? Prime Minister Jansa, how are the escalating energy costs and the appreciating euro affecting Eastern and Central European nations? Do these factors pose a threat to their economic growth and integration? President Barroso, given the increasing disputes between Europe and the United States regarding food safety standards, is there a concern that the EU's regulations are excessively stringent? [SEP] Okay, John, interesting idea by the—His Majesty, the King of Saudi Arabia. Secondly, I articulated a policy that I had been articulating ever since I have been the President. It's the same policy, which is, we believe in a strong dollar and that relative value of economies will end up setting the proper valuation of the dollar. Past growth, or growth with little comparison in the his-tory—this is the growth of energy and food prices. And the food prices are going up due to high cost of energy or oil, and this has a significant effect on the economy in Slovenia and throughout Europe. This is one of the key questions being dealt with at the national level and at the level of the European institutions, as has been mentioned by President Barroso. This is a serious problem. It will, on the one hand, make us search long-term solutions. I have mentioned this in part before. And on the other hand, it will make us search short-term solutions, and one of these is energy efficiency.We have also discussed this at today's summit, and this is a strong message. The investment in research and development, the investment into what the economy can do, an economy that is less dependent on carbon, less dependent on fossil fuels, this will have a long-term strategic effect on the price.So the key is the technology. I remember the President of the United States saying 2 years ago at the summit meeting in Vienna that the key thing is investment in the development of new technologies. This is the key strategic reply to these challenge. And as far as the euro is concerned, on the one hand, we are satisfied and happy that euro is a strong currency. And since the 1st of January of last year, Slovenia is also part of the euro zone. And I can say that in the majority, the effects are positive. When calculating the high prices of oil in dollars, this slightly mitigates this jump. And on the other hand, this is also a problem for importers in the European Union.

It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, when we were opening a development the day before it happened. And I thought it was going to happen because of immigration mostly, but there are probably a lot of reasons. But I would say, yes, I think it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great country, and it wants to be its own boss. It wants to control its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs. This is a very, very special place. And I think it deserves a special place. And I thought maybe for that reason—and for others—but that reason, it was going to happen.Yes, I think it will happen, and I believe the Prime Minister has brought it to a good point where something will take place soon. I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country, yes. And from my point of view, I believe it is important for us to deliver Brexit. We gave that choice to the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the choice to the British people. We should now deliver on that choice. I continue to believe that, actually, it's in the best interests of the U.K. to leave the European Union in an orderly way with a deal. I think we have a good deal. Sadly, the Labour Party and other MPs have, so far, stopped us from delivering Brexit and that deal.But we will—but obviously, this is an issue that is going to continue here in the U.K. I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, with John Howard prioritizing climate change at the APEC summit, haven't you weakened his efforts to set ambitious goals by scheduling your own meeting in Washington? Furthermore, how important do you consider ratifying Kyoto to be in addressing climate change? [SEP] Well, let's tackle the second part first, seeing as my memory ain't what it used to be, so remind me of the first part later. Kyoto, you see, might be dandy for some nations, maybe even made sense for those who signed on, but it just didn't fit the United States. Plain and simple. And I was honest about that. Now, before I even got to Washington, the Senate, they had their say on Kyoto, whether it was right for us. And it was a resounding 95-to-nothing against it. So, it wasn't just my opinion; plenty of folks thought Kyoto wasn't the right path. So, we came up with our own plan: energy efficiency standards based on new technologies. And like I said, we cut greenhouse gases last year while our economy grew by 3 percent. Not many countries can boast that, but we can because our strategy of using new technologies is working. I'm a firm believer that we can lessen our dependence on foreign oil. As an energy exporter, that might ruffle some feathers, but we've got to do it. That's why we put forth the 20-in-10 program. Over the next decade, we'll cut gasoline consumption by 20 percent using ethanol and other new technologies. Battery technology is on the horizon, so folks in Sydney can drive the first 40 miles on battery power without their car looking like a golf cart. The key question is, how do we get these technologies to market quickly? Kyoto didn't do that for us. In fact, if you look at the countries meeting Kyoto targets, you might find a different approach makes more sense. We rejected Kyoto because it wouldn't have allowed us to grow our economy, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and be good stewards of the environment. John and I discussed his desire to make climate change a priority at APEC, and I supported that. I also reminded our G-8 partners that if we want to truly solve global climate change, we need everyone at the table, including China and India. Otherwise, if they feel like a solution is being forced on them without their input, they'll walk away. And you can't have effective global climate change efforts without China. The Prime Minister made a smart move by announcing the need to cut tariffs that hinder the export of technologies that would allow China, for example, to burn coal cleaner. He wants to remove those barriers, and we strongly support him. The fundamental questions are: How quickly can we get effective technologies to market, like coal sequestration and nuclear spent fuel reprocessing? And once they're available, can we help developing nations acquire them? Otherwise, it's a futile exercise. I believe our strategy is the most effective way to address this issue seriously. I appreciate the Prime Minister's focus on this issue and his emphasis on energy dependency and efficiency standards, which are part of the global climate mix. He's showing leadership, and I'm proud to be here discussing it. Alright, thank you.", "label": "Clarification"}

That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do.But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to, quote, unquote, Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken.You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist.Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care: mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you—he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old—thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, working with the California program, I was able to get health care, and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting.Now, what happens on October 1, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesn't have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a web site or call up a call center and sign up for affordable, quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1, into March, there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care.Now, I think the really interesting question is, why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority? The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned: kids staying on their parent's plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance.That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class. At least, they used to say, well, we're going to replace it with something better. There's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.", "label": "Dodging"}

And we want to help him.And, yes, I talked about making sure that Al Qaida doesn't take—doesn't provide— gets safe haven in Iraq. Sure, that's an important part of our strategy. But I also have said that the goal is a country that can defend, sustain, and govern itself. And therefore, to the extent that our troops are needed to help do that, we're willing to do that.

We believe that a combination of fiscal responsibility, structural reforms, and strategic investments is the key to economic recovery.

{"sentence": "Q. So with a few crises behind us and a few more crises ahead of us, taking a step back from this specific debate over the sequester, how, as the leader of this country, do you plan to stop the country from careening to—from crisis to crisis? [SEP] Well, a couple of things. Number one is to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that are important to middle class Americans and those who are fighting to get into the middle class. So if you set aside budget fights for a second, we've been able to get now the Violence Against Women Act done. The conversations that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward. We've seen great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education. There have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence.And what I'm going to keep on trying to do is to make sure that we push on those things that are important to families. And we won't get everything done all at once, but we can get a lot done. So that's point number one.With respect to the budget, what I've done is to make a case to the American people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy. And part of the challenge that we've had here is that not only Congress, but, I think, Washington generally spends all its time talking about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of time talking about how do we create jobs. So I want to make sure that we're talking about both.I think that, for example, we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuilding our roads and bridges. And this is deferred maintenance. We know we're going to have to do it. And I went to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's State to John Boehner's State, and it was a rotten bridge, and everybody knows it. And I'll bet they really want to see that improved. Well, how do we do it? Let's have a conversation about it. That will create jobs. It will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety. That has to be part of this conversation, not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess my point is, Ari, that what I want to try to do is to make sure that we're constantly focused, that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed. Deficit reduction is part of that agenda and an important part. But it's not the only part. And I don't want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this one thing.And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that, over time—perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say, you know what, we stuck tough on the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the Republican Caucus is in a better mood when they come back—maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.And the good thing about America is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we get stuck, and you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people pretty steadily are commonsense and practical, and eventually, that commonsense, practical approach wins out. And I think that's what will happen here as well.And in the meantime, just to make the final point about the sequester, we will get through this. This is not going to be a apocalypse, I think, as some people have said. It's just dumb. And it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt individual people, and it's going to hurt the economy overall.But if Congress comes to its senses a week from now, a month from now, 3 months from now, then there's a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the American people dramatically. And so I—this is a temporary stop on what I believe is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness.Thank you very much. All right?", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "President, will this be concluded before you leave office? And do you endorse Israel's behavior? [SEP] I certainly hope so. I advocate for a sustainable cease-fire.

The best way to ensure a sustainable cease-fire is to work with Egypt to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza that allows Hamas to continue to fire rockets. Countries supplying weapons to Hamas need to stop. The international community needs to continue to pressure them to stop providing weapons.

And there's an untested and unproved—unapproved drug in the U.S. that appears to be helping some of the Americans who are infected. Is your administration considering at all sending supplies of this drug if it becomes available to some of these countries in West Africa? And could you discuss a bit the ethics of either providing an untested drug to a foreign country or providing it only to Americans and not to other countries that are harder hit if it could possibly save lives? [SEP] Well, I think we've got to let the science guide us. And I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful. What we do know is that the Ebola virus, both currently and in the past, is controllable if you have a strong public health infrastructure in place.And the countries that have been affected are the first to admit that what's happened here is, is that their public health systems have been overwhelmed. They weren't able to identify and then isolate cases quickly enough. You did not have a strong trust relationship between some of the communities that were affected and public health workers. As a consequence, it spread more rapidly than has been typical with the periodic Ebola outbreaks that have occurred previously.But despite obviously the extraordinary pain and hardship of the families and persons who've been affected, and despite the fact that we have to take this very seriously, it is important to remind ourselves, this is not an airborne disease; this is one that can be controlled and contained very effectively if we use the right protocols.So what we've done is to make sure that we're surging not just U.S. resources, but we've reached out to European partners and partners from other countries, working with the WHO. Let's get all the health workers that we need on the ground. Let's help to bolster the systems that they already have in place. Let's nip as early as possible any additional outbreaks of the disease. And then during the course of that process, I think it's entirely appropriate for us to see if there are additional drugs or medical treatments that can improve the survivability of what is a very deadly and obviously brutal disease.So we're going to—we're focusing on the public health approach right now because we know how to do that.

Do you still believe the UK should be at the back of the queue for a US trade deal? And will you actively promote the TPP while campaigning for Secretary Clinton? [SEP] Well, Roberta, those are some excellent questions. I'll even help my friends out a bit on that last one. When I visit other countries, it's not my place to comment on candidates in the middle of a race. Governments tend to transcend whoever is in power. With respect to Brexit, the markets seem to have settled down a bit. We're monitoring for any systemic strains. Central banks and our Treasury Secretary have prepared well. There are longer-term concerns about global growth if Brexit freezes investment in Great Britain or Europe. We need to boost global demand. Whether it's the US improving infrastructure, or Germany spending more, or China shifting to domestic-based growth. With respect to Brexit negotiations, my message is: everyone should catch their breath, come up with an orderly, transparent plan. Both sides have a stake in getting this right. Leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved quickly. Chancellor Merkel's interest is in making sure the process works. We'll help in any way we can. As for the UK and a trade agreement, they'll be the least of their problems right now. Their first order of business is Europe. But the special relationship with Great Britain doesn't change. The ties are deep and long-lasting. Our relationship with the UK fundamentally doesn't change. Their absence from the EU makes it harder to solve other challenges. Our relationship goes far deeper than any individual leaders. Canada, the US, and Mexico will continue to have close relationships. I look forward to working with whomever the American people elect as their President. I know we will always be able to find shared priorities. My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. We are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. In the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.We have reached so far—the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world—without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society—or the societies, at least, of our three countries—had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past—and President Obama already said it, even years back—but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind.", "label": "Implicit"}

I hope we continue to find ground by making sure our troops get funded.We found common ground on FISA. My only question is, why change a good law? The way that law was written works for the security of the country. That's what the American people want to know, by the way. Are we passing laws that are beneficial to the American people? This law is beneficial because it enables our intelligence experts to—and professionals to find out the intentions of Al Qaida.

As you recognize, I'm not a member of the legislative branch; probably wouldn't be a very good legislator. But as the head of the executive branch, it makes sense to call upon Congress to show progress and get results. It's hard to find common ground unless important bills are moving. They're not even moving. And not one appropriations bill has made it to my desk.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, do you agree with the National Intelligence Estimate that we are now in a civil war in Iraq? And also, you talk about victory, that you have to have victory in Iraq; it would be catastrophic if we didn't. You said again today that the enemy would come here, and yet you say it's not an open-ended commitment. How do you square those things? [SEP] You know, victory in Iraq is not going to be like victory in World War II. And it's one of the challenges I have, to explain to the American people what Iraq will look like in a situation that will enable us to say, we have accomplished our mission.First, the—Iraq will be a society in which there is relative peace. I say relative peace because if it's, like, zero car bombings, it never will happen that way. It's like—I mean, the fundamental question is, can we help this Government have the security force level necessary to make sure that the ethnic cleansing that was taking place in certain neighborhoods has stopped?Look, there's criminality in Iraq as well as the ethnic violence. And we've got to help the Iraqis have a police force that deals with criminals. There is an Al Qaida presence in Iraq, as you know. I believe some of the spectacular bombings have been caused by Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, Zarqawi—the terrorist Zarqawi, who is not an Iraqi—made it very clear that he intended to use violence to spur sectarian—car bombings and spectacular violence—to spur sectarian violence. And he did a good job of it.And so there—and then there's this disaffected Sunnis, people who believe that they should still be in power in spite of the fact that the Shi'a are the majority of the country. And they're willing to use violence to try to create enough chaos so they get back in power.The reason I described that is that no matter what you call it, it's a complex situation, and it needed to be dealt with inside of Iraq. We've got people who say civil war; we've got people on the ground who don't believe it's a civil war. But nevertheless, it is—it was dangerous enough that I had to make a decision to try to stop it, so that a government that is bound by a constitution, where the country feels relatively secure as a result of a security force that is evenhanded in its application of security; a place where the vast resources of the country—this is a relatively wealthy country, in that they've got a lot of hydrocarbons—is shared equally amongst people; that there is a federalism that evolves under the Constitution, where the local Provinces have got authority as well; and where people who may have made a political decision in the past and yet weren't criminals can participate in the life of the country; and is an ally in the war on terror—in other words, that there is a bulwark for moderation as opposed to a safe haven for extremism.

It's a massive investment in climate change, the largest in history, so there will inevitably be glitches. For example, the provision about free trade agreements was intended to apply to allies, not literally every country with a free trade agreement. We can work these things out. The core principle is ensuring the United States, and hopefully Europe, doesn't have to rely on anyone else's supply chain. We want to be our own supply chain and share that with our allies. There are tweaks we can make to make it easier for European countries to participate or be self-sufficient. It was never my intention to exclude our allies. The goal was to prevent situations like the pandemic, where we couldn't get computer chips because China decided not to sell them to us. We invented those things!

Visiting Ghana allows people to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's different from just giving speeches in America. It's about meeting people involved in making Ghana better. Africa has changed positively since I became president, thanks to African leaders, not me. There were six regional conflicts when I started. Take Liberia, for example. It was a serious issue, and with Nigeria and John's advice, we made decisions that helped install the first democratically elected woman president in Africa. I'm going there tomorrow to celebrate her successes and reaffirm our commitment. Conflict resolution has been happening, and the U.S. has been a helpful partner, like in eastern Congo, working with the presidents of Rwanda, Congo, and Burundi. Democracy is also progressing, thanks to examples like John Kufuor. He's a respected leader. Our aid program has changed from just giving money to expecting certain habits in return, like fighting corruption and investing in education. I don't think that's too much to ask for U.S. taxpayers' money. It's a new approach, but I believe in setting high standards for African leaders. I have confidence in the leaders I've met on this trip. They're committed to their people, honest government, and investing in people. They care more about education than self-serving government.

What leverage remains on abductions post-delisting? Mr. Fukuda, did you request President Bush to rethink delisting? If not, why? What specific U.S. collaboration will you seek on abductions after delisting? [SEP] North Korea is the most heavily sanctioned nation, period. They only escape those sanctions by verifiable commitment fulfillment. Delisting doesn't equal sanctions removal. They have huge obligations to meet. It's action for action. The cooling tower destruction was verifiable, a positive sign. We still have concerns, like the abductions. The question implies we should ask the U.S. to reverse delisting. Regarding the nuclear issue, we've entered a new phase. Success benefits Japan. Simultaneously, we must resolve the abduction issue. Nuclear progress shouldn't halt abduction progress.

And here's how—and I like to quote Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said, The biggest fear in South America is not the leader in Venezuela, but the biggest fear for stability is if the United States Congress rejects the free trade agreement with Colombia.It would be an insult to a friend. It would send a contradictory message to a country led by a very strong leader who is working hard to deal with some very difficult problems, one of which is armed gangs of people that are ruthless and brutal, people who just kidnap innocent people for the sake of achieving political objectives.And so a vote for democracy took place, a very strong vote for democracy.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow up on Jackie's question. One of the reasons why so many of the people of the Occupy Wall Street protests are so angry is because, as you say, so many people on Wall Street did not follow the rules, but your administration hasn't really been very aggressive in prosecuting. In fact, I don't think any Wall Street executives have gone to jail despite the rampant corruption and malfeasance that did take place. So I was wondering if you'd comment on that.And then just as a separate question, as you're watching the Solyndra and Fast and Furious controversies play out, I'm wondering if it gives you any pause about any of the decisionmaking going on in your administration: some of the e-mails that Democrats put out indicating that people at the Office of Management and Budget were concerned about the Department of Energy; some of the e-mails going on with the Attorney General saying he didn't know about the details of Fast and Furious. Are you worried at all about how this is--how your administration is running? [SEP] Well, first on the issue of prosecutions on Wall Street, one of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehmans and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal, it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless. That's exactly why we needed to pass Dodd-Frank, to prohibit some of these practices.The financial sector is very creative, and they are always looking for ways to make money. That's their job. And if there are loopholes and rules that can be bent and arbitrage to be had, they will take advantage of it. So without commenting on particular prosecutions--obviously, that's not my job, that's the Attorney General's job--I think part of people's frustrations, part of my frustration, was a lot of practices that should not have been allowed weren't necessarily against the law, but they had a huge destructive impact. And that's why it was important for us to put in place financial rules that protect the American people from reckless decisionmaking and irresponsible behavior.Now, with respect to Solyndra and Fast and Furious, I think I've been very clear that I have complete confidence in Attorney General Holder in how he handles his office. He has been very aggressive in going after gun running and cash transactions that are going to these transnational drug cartels in Mexico. There has been a lot of cooperation between the United States and Mexico on this front. He's indicated that he was not aware of what was happening in Fast and Furious. Certainly, I was not. And I think both he and I would have been very unhappy if somebody had suggested that guns were allowed to pass through that could have been prevented by the United States of America.He has assigned an Inspector General to look into how exactly this happened, and I have complete confidence in him and I've got complete confidence in the process to figure out who, in fact, was responsible for that decision and how it got made.Solyndra, this is a loan guarantee program that predates me that historically has had support from Democrats and Republicans as well. And the idea is pretty straightforward: If we are going to be able to compete in the 21st century, then we've got to dominate cutting-edge technologies, we've got to dominate cutting-edge manufacturing. Clean energy is part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States if we're going to be able to succeed.Now, the loan guarantee program is designed to meet a particular need in the marketplace, which is, a lot of these small startups, they can get angel investors, they can get several million dollars to get a company going, but it's very hard for them to then scale up, particularly if these are new cutting-edge technologies. It's hard for them to find private investors. And part of what's happening is China and Europe, other countries, are putting enormous subsidies into these companies and giving them incentives to move offshore. Even if the technology was developed in the United States, they end up going to China because the Chinese Government will say, we're going to help you get started. We'll help you scale up. We'll give you low-interest loans or no-interest loans. We will give siting. We will do whatever it takes for you to get started here.And that's part of the reason why a lot of technologies that developed here, we've now lost the lead in: solar energy, wind energy. And so what the loan guarantee program was designed to do was to close that gap and say, let's see if we can help some of those folks locate here and create jobs here in the United States.Now, we knew from the start that the loan guarantee program was going to entail some risk, by definition. If it was a risk-free proposition, then we wouldn't have to worry about it. But the overall portfolio has been successful. It has allowed us to help companies, for example, start advanced battery manufacturing here in the United States. It's helped to create jobs. There were going to be some companies that did not work out; Solyndra was one of them. But the process by which the decision was made was on the merits. It was straightforward. And of course, there were going to be debates internally when you're dealing with something as complicated as this.But I have confidence that the decisions were made based on what would be good for the American economy and the American people and putting people back to work.And by the way, let me make one last point about this. I heard there was a Republican Member of Congress who's engaging in oversight on this, and despite the fact that all of them in the past have been supportive of this loan guarantee program, he concluded, you know what, we can't compete against China when it comes to solar energy. Well, you know what, I don't buy that. I'm not going to surrender to other countries' technological leads that could end up determining whether or not we're building a strong middle class in this country. And so we're going to have to keep on pushing hard to make sure that manufacturing is located here, new businesses are located here, and new technologies are developed here. And there are going to be times where it doesn't work out, but I'm not going to cave to the competition when they are heavily subsidizing all these industries.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, in light of the Pope's potential recognition of a Palestinian state and its potential ramifications for a two-state solution with Israel, could you elaborate on whether you perceive this as a constructive measure or a misjudgment, and how it might influence the two-state solution you've previously championed? [SEP] Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for the Senate's progress in granting me the authority to pursue trade agreements that are both intelligent and promote growth, not only in the Asia-Pacific region but also potentially in Europe. This also empowers us to enforce these agreements, which hasn't always been the case. I want to thank the Senators who voted to support this, or at least to begin the debate. For those who didn't, I'll continue to make my case, providing them with the necessary information to understand that despite past issues with trade deals, our approach is the right one, not just for large corporations, but for small and medium-sized businesses, and most importantly, for American workers. I wouldn't support any agreement that I didn't believe would create jobs and opportunities for Americans to climb the ladder of success, with higher incomes and wages. That's been my primary focus since assuming office. The issue between myself and Elizabeth is not personal. The press likes to highlight disagreements between allies, but many of my closest friends in the Senate and House disagree with me on this issue. I understand their concerns about plants closing and jobs being shipped overseas. They worry about the enforcement of labor and environmental agreements and whether trade is truly fair. They share my deep concern about rising inequality and the impact of automation and globalization on the middle class. These are people whose values align with mine. They even released a progressive statement of principles that mirrored my agenda, except for trade. This is a policy difference, a disagreement on what's best for our constituents. I firmly believe that despite past problems, we're better off writing high-standard rules with strong enforcement on issues like child labor, deforestation, and intellectual property. If we don't, China and other countries will, disadvantaging our businesses and workers. As for outsourcing fears, companies seeking low-cost labor can already do so. Our opportunity lies in attracting companies back to manufacture here. Nike's potential return of 10,000 jobs due to new technologies is an example of this. But we need to be able to sell overseas to fully capitalize on these opportunities. That's why I argue with my progressive friends that we need to focus on shared objectives like a strong minimum wage, job training programs, infrastructure investments, stronger collective bargaining laws, and enforcement of overtime pay and paid sick leave. We need an honest conversation about our budgets and stop preserving loopholes for corporations that provide no economic benefit. These are the things that will address their concerns. Blocking a trade deal won't, especially since they acknowledge the existing rules are bad for U.S. workers. How does clinging to the status quo help them? It doesn't make sense. I support enforcement and the signed provisions. I have concerns about the currency language in the bill, but I need to discuss with Senators Schumer and Brown how to ensure it doesn't negatively impact our monetary policy.

You have—you look at Michigan you look at some States—I mean they just want to keep these people in their houses in their prisons. They call them prisons.

We're helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing except they just exploded. They just had very big flare-ups. You understand that. No we're doing very well. And I don't have to show you the charts again but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible.I think we're going to have a fantastic third quarter.

Regarding the media policy, we are currently reviewing it in consultation with the Department of Defense, and I cannot provide a definitive answer at this time. Afghanistan presents a complex and multifaceted challenge. While Iraq has demonstrated progress, Afghanistan's government remains fragile, and the threat of the Taliban and Al Qaida persists. We require a concerted and comprehensive effort to eliminate their safe havens. General Petraeus and Special Envoy Holbrooke are conducting a thorough review and developing a regional approach. We must enhance coordination between our military, diplomatic, and development efforts, working closely with our allies. We must not forget that this region served as the launching pad for the 9/11 attacks. We cannot allow Afghanistan to become a haven for terrorists.

He must recognize that an invasion of Ukraine would be a monumental error, with devastating consequences for Europe and the global community. He would face severe repercussions. I have been forthright and direct with President Putin, both in our phone conversations and in person.

The people choose their leader, and I'll work with whoever they pick. I did speak with President-elect Sarkozy shortly after his victory – about 8:03 Paris time, I believe. I'm grateful he took my call. I met him before and found him to be smart and energetic. We'll have our disagreements, but also areas of agreement, and I look forward to working with him. As for Vice President Cheney's trip, his main message to the Iraqis is that they need to speed things up, especially on passing laws that promote reconciliation. There's a clock ticking here in Washington, and they need to understand that. He'll also be talking to other friends in the region about the Iranian issue. We understand the consequences of Iran potentially acquiring nuclear weapons, and we're working to build a united front against that. We've already convinced the EU-3, Russia, and China to join us diplomatically, and we need to keep that unity. Cheney will also remind everyone that success in Iraq is crucial for dealing with Iran.

{"sentence": "Q. I get another one. [Laughter] This is a good deal. Can you tell us whether you think your personal relationship with the Democratic leaders in Congress has had a negative impact on your ability to get your legislation through? And how important is that personal relationship? [SEP] I have got cordial relations with the leaders when I talk to them. I saw Speaker Pelosi last night at the Congressional Ball at the White House, and we have very cordial relations. Here's— Congress—the Democrats in Congress, in the House and the Senate, need to work out their differences before they come to the White House. You can imagine what it's like to try to deal on an important piece of legislation, and the Democrats in the House have one opinion, and the Democrats in the Senate have another opinion. FISA is a good example.And in order for us to be able to reach accord, they've got to come with one voice, one position. And it's—nobody—like, the most disappointing thing about Washington has been the name-calling and this kind of—people go out in front of the mikes, and they just kind of unleash. And I've tried hard not to do that. I've tried to be respectful to all parties. And that's disappointing.On the other hand, I think we can get some things done. The Peruvian trade vote is one; there's an example. And the Congress needs to get their differences sorted. One of the worst ways to negotiate is to negotiate with one group. They pocket your negotiations, and then another group shows up and says, Well, you've said this to them, now give us this.And hopefully, as we come down the stretch here, that they're capable of coming forward with, Here's what we believe; here's our plan; here's what we would like you to consider, as opposed to some examples, which is passing legislation for the sake of the headline, as opposed to passing legislation to get it passed. And SCHIP is a classic example. They knew I was going to veto the bill. They knew that was going to happen. They knew the veto would be sustained. But they ate up valuable time and passed the bill anyway.And so we sit here in the White House trying to figure out why. Why would you waste time? Why wouldn't you sit down and try to seriously negotiate an agreement on a bill that they knew was going to get vetoed and sustained?Now, hopefully, in the next—however long they intend to stay here, that we're capable of working together. But if not, I'm going to stand strong for certain principles, and one of which is to make sure our troops get funded. We've got men and women in combat. We've got people risking their lives for the United States of America. And this Congress has yet to fund them, and it needs to. And it needs to fund them without telling our military how to conduct this war. Arbitrary dates for withdrawal are unacceptable, particularly given the fact that the strategy is working—it's working.And it seems like to me that this Congress ought to be congratulating our military commanders and our troops. And one way to send a congratulatory message is to give them the funds they need, and now is the time to do it.Let's see here, Mark Silva [Chicago Tribune].", "label": "Explicit"}

Simultaneously, intelligence indicates that Al-Qaeda is regaining strength along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

[SEP] We take President Karzai's allegations seriously and will investigate them thoroughly in conjunction with Afghan authorities. It's undeniable that extremist elements are operating within Pakistan and crossing into Afghanistan, a situation that concerns all involved parties. We share a mutual enemy in those who seek to undermine democratic processes through violence. Al-Qaeda, while significantly weakened, remains a threat. We've applied considerable pressure globally, including within Pakistan, and will continue to do so with the cooperation of our Pakistani partners. I am confident that the Pakistani government recognizes the gravity of the extremist threat. I anticipate further discussions on this matter with the Pakistani Prime Minister next week. Pakistan remains an ally and a friend. The United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan share a common objective. I recall a productive meeting with Presidents Musharraf and Karzai where we emphasized the necessity of cross-border cooperation to prevent the training and infiltration of dangerous elements into Afghanistan, and their subsequent return with skills that could be used against the government. While progress has been made, the struggle continues. We were encouraged by the recent Provincial elections.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, the Democrats have voted for a withdrawal timetable from Iraq, which you have said that you will veto. What ideas do you have for breaking this logjam going forward? And would you be willing to veto a second bill? [SEP] Well, first of all, haven't vetoed the first bill yet. But I'm going to. And the reason why I'm going to is because the Members of Congress have made military decisions on behalf of the military. They're telling our generals what to do. They're withdrawing before we've even finished reinforcing our troops in Baghdad. They're sending, in my judgment, a bad message to the Iraqis and to an enemy and, most importantly, to our military folks. And so I made it clear, I'd veto.And, by the way, they're adding spending that shouldn't belong in the bill in the first place. Maybe they're important issues, but they ought to be—these spending bills ought to be—or spending issues ought to be debated in the normal course of business. And so I've said this all along; my position has been consistent.I'm sorry it's come to this. In other words, I'm sorry that we've had this, you know, the issue evolve the way it has. But nevertheless, it is what it is, and it will be vetoed, and my veto will be sustained. And then the question is the way forward. And my suggestion is that—and I invite the leaders of the House and the Senate, both parties, to come down soon after my veto so we can discuss a way forward. And if the Congress wants to test my will as to whether or not I'll accept a timetable for withdrawal—I won't accept one. I just don't think it's in the interest of our troops.I think it—I'm just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of Iraq and realizing that politicians have all of the sudden made military determinations. And in my judgment, that would put a kid in harm's way, more so than he or she already is. I really think it's a mistake for Congress to try to tell generals, our military experts, how to conduct a war.And furthermore, the idea of putting all kinds of extraneous spending on a bill, the bill—purpose of which is to fund our troops, is—I just don't accept that. So if they want to try again, that which I have said was unacceptable, then of course I'll veto it, but I hope it doesn't come to that. I believe we can work a way forward. And I think we can come to our senses and make sure that we get the money to the troops in a timely fashion. It's important to have a political debate, but as I've consistently said, we don't want our troops in between the debate. And Congress needs to get this money to the Pentagon so the Pentagon can get the money to the troops and so our readiness will be up to par and people—training missions will go forward.I know Congress, no matter what their position is on the war, doesn't want to affect readiness, and they don't want to affect the military families—I understand that— but they're going to if they keep trying to pass legislation that is—that just doesn't—that withdraws troops or micromanages the war.And so I'm optimistic we can get a bill, a good bill, and a bill that satisfies all our objectives, and that's to get the money to the troops as quickly as possible.", "label": "Explicit"}

Well, I've read many comments--and I must say I've been quite amused--on the relations between European leaders and the President of the United States. I say I'm amused because I've thought to myself, well, when we speak to one another, people must be listening to our phone calls, because I have seen reports on conversations and discussions which in no way resemble anything that has ever taken place between Barack Obama and myself.Now, why is it easy for us to work? And I speak on behalf of Chancellor Merkel, Gordon Brown, and other leaders. Well, because , when he says something, keeps his word. His word is his bond. And that is so important. There's a joke among us: We don't like surprises. Well, from that point of view, there's no surprises. When he can, he delivers; when he can't, he says so. So there are no surprises. And we try to be likewise.Furthermore, secondly, on all topics--and there have been some pretty tough topics. I mean, for instance, bonus--taxes on bonuses, regulation, financial regulations--pretty heavy-going stuff--Copenhagen. I mean, I happen to think that is a step ahead of public opinion in the United States on this. But we're constantly talking about it. It's even who wanted us to have a call conference, a videoconference virtually every month with Angela Merkel and Gordon Brown.Now, this doesn't merely mean that we absolutely agree neck and neck on everything, but we talk amongst ourselves. And this is a novelty from the point of view of Europe, whenever we look at the United States, that everything is put on the table, anything can be discussed, everything can be discussed.What matters, you see, is not whether we agree once systematically before we've even started discussing thing--that's suspicious. It's to say, whatever divergence of views we may have, we can talk about it among ourselves. And I say things very frankly to you, and this is what all we European leaders believe and think.I've also heard it said that Europe was less interested in the United States. Well, for heaven's sake, how many times do we have to come over to show that we are interested? What would it mean if we were interested?So, very frankly and very honestly on this, not only is it not an issue, not a problem, but it's great to be able to work under such conditions. I would say that what I have to say about is the same as what Bernard Kouchner could say about Hillary Clinton or Christine Lagarde about Tim Geithner--that we're constantly having a dialogue.I could even take you--give you an example of something on which we don't necessarily agree, such as Syria--or we didn't agree. France took an initiative, as you know. Well, I'll say this to you. At no point--no point has turned his back on what we were doing. Constantly, he's watching; he's listening. We're constantly exchanging information on the subject, even when there are more complex topics, including in our relations with the Russians. Before even we inform our Russian--or the Russians or our partners, I pick up the phone, I call , and he knows exactly what we're going to do and why we're going to do it. You follow me on that?So there may be disagreements, but never for the wrong reasons. And as we are very transparent on both sides, there's confidence, there's trust. And I really think I can say that. There's a lot of trust.Now, trust always helps one overcome, perhaps, diverging interests.

{"sentence": "With the slowdown in the drawdown here, we're looking at more risk, more danger for U.S. troops that are in Afghanistan. How do you justify that to them? How do you tell them that the mission is still worth it? And how do you assure them that there is an end coming to this mission? And for President Ghani, you've talked the last couple days a lot about the sacrifice of U.S. troops. You were at Arlington earlier today. How do you tell them that this continued sacrifice will be worth it to them as well? [SEP] Well, Leo, let's remember the timeline for our withdrawal to an Embassy-centered presence by the end of 2016 hasn't changed. Our transition out of a combat role hasn't changed. I acknowledge the risks for our troops in Afghanistan; it's a dangerous place. But casualties have decreased significantly as we've drawn down. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed there, precisely because we're not in a combat role. The Afghan security services have made significant sacrifices, stepping up as we've drawn down. They're fighting with courage and tenacity, improving month by month. But we can't minimize the sacrifices our military families make. Some will rotate back into Afghanistan for a few extra months. We're essentially shifting the drawdown pace to the right to compensate for the lengthy government formation and to ensure we're helping Afghan security forces succeed, preventing a return due to terrorist activities launched from Afghanistan. We're on track, and as Commander in Chief, I believe providing a few extra months to help with logistics, equipment usage, training, advising, and strategic input is wise. President Ghani, as Commander in Chief, is conducting a serious review to assess strengths and weaknesses for more effective joint planning. Our troops and their families make enormous sacrifices. This means some who would have been home will remain in Afghanistan under the new schedule. But we've gone from 100,000 to under 10,000, and they're not on the front lines. Force protection is a priority. The drawdown completion date remains unchanged. General Campbell and others on the ground believe this additional timeframe to help Afghan security forces succeed is worthwhile. We're asking our troops to fight for our freedom and a more orderly world. This raises a point about budgets. It's a good time for Congress to review their budgets. Holding defense and nondefense budgets to 2006 levels makes it harder to do our job, both on national security and at home, ensuring our troops have a strong economy, good schools for their kids, college access, and deserved veterans benefits.

I—hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.But he went up to the microphone, and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet—which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this—exact, word for word—he said, Wow, he didn't do anything wrong. So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out, and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said. It has to be a criminal act. It has to be. And he should resign. And some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing.And just so you know, the call was perfect, the real call; the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders—you can name any one of them—but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies. My knowledge—I know all about it. And so this isn't something like: Oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret. This is many people on the line. I don't even know how many. We'll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. He didn't say anything.

There was no quid pro quo, at all. And if you look at this whistleblower's—which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they're real—his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.But what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call. Because I don't like doing that. I don't want to do it. I hope I don't have to do it again: release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don't want to do that, John. I don't want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian Government. We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them, Would it be okay?

{"sentence": "Mr. President, your proposed budget hinges on increased tax revenue from multinational corporations outsourcing jobs and from the oil and gas sector, a policy you've championed for years. Given your inability to enact this through a Democratic-controlled Congress, what leads you to believe you can succeed now? Furthermore, does this not undermine your efforts towards deficit-neutral corporate tax reform? [SEP] My conviction remains unchanged. Therefore, we shall persist in our efforts. The distinguishing factor lies in the widespread acknowledgment of the imperative to address the deficit. A genuine commitment to deficit reduction necessitates a comprehensive examination of unwarranted expenditures within the Tax Code, specifically tax incentives that fail to enhance our competitiveness or generate employment opportunities domestically. The examples you cited are, in the estimation of most economists, detrimental to our long-term economic growth. If such incentives are indeed counterproductive, why should we permit certain entities to remit lower taxes than those who are actively creating jobs and investing within the United States? Why should our investments be confined to antiquated energy sources, rather than those that hold promise for the future, particularly when the former are demonstrably profitable and do not require preferential tax treatment? A sincere commitment to deficit and debt reduction mandates a holistic approach, encompassing all contributing factors. Selective measures are insufficient. This principle extends to the Democratic Party as well. Certain provisions within this budget are personally challenging for me to accept. Cities and states across the nation are grappling with budgetary constraints due to diminished revenue streams. They face escalating demands as a consequence of job losses and the persistent challenges within the housing market. Yet, this budget proposes a 10 percent reduction in community development block grants. While I find this undesirable, I am nonetheless acquiescing to it. A spirit of compromise is incumbent upon all parties. Corporate tax reform, by its very nature, seeks to simplify the tax code, eliminate loopholes, and ensure equitable treatment for all. This objective is entirely consistent with the principle that the oil industry, given its substantial profitability and capacity for self-funded investment, should not receive preferential tax treatment.", "label": "Implicit"}

It's imperative for our national security to maintain a fully stocked SPR in the event of a significant disruption. Extremist groups, such as Al Qaeda, might target oil facilities. An attack in a major oil-exporting nation would negatively impact our economy and those who oppose such groups. The SPR is vital to mitigate such risks. Were I to believe it would positively influence prices, I would seriously consider it.

It would render us vulnerable in the event of a national security crisis.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And two questions. There are concerns about how the immigration bill from the House , from the Gang of Eight—in the House, has complicated chances for immigration reform in the Senate. It seems to be a more conservative proposal. Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? That's immigration.And second, on Mexico, yesterday the Mexican Government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the Federal Interior Ministry. Is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico? Do you think the level of security and cooperation can be maintained? [SEP] On immigration reform, I've been impressed by the work that was done by the Gang of Eight in the Senate. The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is: We've got to have more effective border security, although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last 4 to 5 years. We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system. We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion. And we want to make sure that we've got a pathway to citizenship that is tough, but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country.And the Senate bill meets thatthose criteria, in some cases not in the way that I would, but it meets those basic criteria. And I think it's a it's a testament to the Senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and made some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill.Now, I haven't seen what Members of the House are yet proposing. And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better. And I think we've got to be open minded in seeing what they come up with. The bottom line, though, is, is that they've still got to meet those basic criteria: Is it making the border safer? Is it dealing with employers in how they work with the governments to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of or taking advantage of the system? Are we improving our legal immigration system? And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this country?And if they meet those criteria, but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise. If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.When it comes to Mexico, I'm very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new President, Peña Nieto. I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first, more extensive consultations, and it will be an opportunity for his Ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating, to really hammer out some of these issues.A lot of the focus is going to be on economics. We've spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes, I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border. We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time.That doesn't mean that we're not going to be talking about security. I think that in my first conversation with the President, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels. We've made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two Governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved.And some of the issues that he's talking about really had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se. So I'm not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I've heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish.But overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new President is serious about reform. He's already made some tough decisions. I think he's going to make more that will improve the economy and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well.And I don't want to leave out that we're also going to be talking to, during my visit to Costa Rica, Presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues, but are important partners for us, because I think that the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States. That will enhance our economy. That can improve our energy independence.There are a whole range of opportunities, and that's going to be the purpose of this trip.

{"sentence": "Q. Are you going to launch an effort to try to delay the election? Or was that just a trial balloon this morning? The President. Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation—I mean, you look at article after article: New York's Mail-Vote Disaster, Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out in this year's primaries. What will happen in November? It's a mess. This is done by Washington Post. Can you believe it? The Washington Post, of all papers. Fake news, but in this case, it's not fake, it's true.This is done by the Wall Street Journal. Here's another one, Vote-by-mail experiment reveals potential problems within postal voting system ahead in the November election. And you see what's happening with so many different places. They're doing even trial runs; they're a disaster.And I don't want to see an election—you know, so many years, I've been watching elections. And they say the projected winner or the winner of the election—I don't want to see that take place in a week after November 3 or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.You're sending out hundreds of millions of universal, mail-in ballots—hundreds of millions. Where are they going? Who are they being sent to? It's common sense; you don't have to know anything about politics. And the Democrats know this. The Democrats know this, Steve.So I want to see—I want an election and a result much, much more than you. I think we're doing very well. We have the same fake polls, but we have real polls. We're doing very well.I just left Texas. And Biden came out against fracking. Well, that means Texas is going to be one of the most unemployed States in our country. That means Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico are going to be a disaster. Ohio, Pennsylvania—disaster. No fracking.I want to have the result of the election. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and months. And literally, potentially—if you really did it right—years, because you'll never know.These ballots are missing. You saw Paterson, New Jersey. You saw many other instances. There's tremendous litigation on that right now.And that doesn't include absentee. Absentee is different. Absentee, you have to work and you have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure. Like, for instance, I'm an absentee voter because I can't be in Florida because I'm in Washington; I'm at the White House. So I'll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. So we're in favor of absentee, but it's much different than millions of people.In California, they're going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud, all over the ballots.So no, I want to get—I want to be standing, hopefully, hand held high, big victory, because we're doing things with our country that I think nobody else could have done. Our country is—despite this pandemic, which is devastating the rest of the world, by the way—devastating.One of the articles that came out was, The World's COVID Resurgence. This is the Wall Street Journal editorial, the main editorial yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. I don't always agree with them. But they have The World's COVID Resurgence. Countries hailed as models to see—and then they go, the virus returns at a level it's never—they haven't even seen.We've been giving praise to certain countries, and the virus has now come to them like the first time. But it's a very interesting—and it talks about many countries where everybody was holding them up and saying what a great job they did. Well, it's just one of those things. Didn't work out so well. So we want to have an election. I'd love to see voter ID, but this is the opposite of voter ID. The Democrats love it; the Republicans hate it. We all agree that absentee voting is good. Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud.You know, we talk about Russia, Russia, Russia for 2½ years, and then they found nothing, and there was nothing. But they talk Russia, Russia, Russia. They talk China. They talk all of these countries. They say they get involved in our elections. This is easy. You can forge ballots. This is much easier for foreign countries.Go ahead, Steve. Q. But delaying the election is probably a nonstarter. I mean, wouldn't you agree with that? [SEP] I just feel—I don't want a delay. I want to have the election. But I also don't want to have to wait for 3 months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything. That's what's going to happen, Steve. That's common sense, and everyone knows it. Smart people know it. Stupid people may not know it. And some people don't want to talk about it, but they know it.And no, we want to have an election where people actually go in and—What's your name? My name is so-and-so. Boom, you sign the book, like I've been doing for years.It's very, very unfair to our country. If they do this, our country will be a laughingstock all over the world, because everyone knows it doesn't work.How many ballots is he sending in California, as an example? Twenty-eight million or some massive number? Other States are sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, they've done it. They had experiments. They had news organizations experimenting.And look, read the story in the Washington Post about mail-in voting; it's a disaster. I'm very surprised to see that story, frankly, from them. The story is a disaster. So we're asking for a lot of trouble.And no, do I want to see a date change? No. But I don't want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens.John [John Roberts, Fox News].", "label": "Explicit"}

[SEP] Our objective is to make sure that ISIL is not an ongoing threat to the region. We can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, and it's going to take some effort. As we've seen with Al Qaida, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities. You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act. But what we can do is to make sure that the kind of systemic and broad-based aggression that we've seen out of ISIL that terrorizes primarily Muslims—Shia, Sunni—terrorizes Kurds, terrorizes not just Iraqis, but people throughout the region, that that is degraded to the point where it is no longer the kind of factor that we've seen it being over the last several months.", "label": "General"}

And again, that's not just my opinion, that's the opinion of a whole lot of constitutional law professors and academics and judges and lawyers who have examined this law, even if they're not particularly sympathetic to this particular piece of legislation or my Presidency. Your question was a little local for me, and so I'm glad that the President of the United States answered it. But I would take advantage of this moment to say that after increasing the budget line for the folk insurance six-fold and after having built more than 1,000 new clinics in the country, we're getting close to reaching universal coverage of health care: full, free health care coverage for all people up to 18 years of age, including cancer coverage. Of the 120--112 million Mexicans, 106 million will have efficient, effective universal health care coverage.So I would say that I would hope that one of the greatest economies in the world, such as the United States, could follow our example in achieving this, because it was a great thing. Well, I don't think you really expect me to intervene in the U.S. Presidential election. Let me just say this. For Canada--and this is something that I think transcends governments in Canada or administrations here in the United States--for Canada, the United States is and always will be our closest neighbor, our greatest ally, and our best friend. And I believe that American leadership is at all times great and indispensable for the world.And I think over the past few years we've done great things together in terms of the response both through the G-20 and bilaterally on the recession and the recovery.

Even if people disagree with the Iraq war, they should understand that we're engaged in a global battle for values. You don't win that battle by being a fair-weather friend. You don't win by hesitating or withdrawing support when the going gets tough. You don't win by losing your nerve when your enemy is resolute. Our two countries share fundamental values, and that's what matters. The fact that we can both stand here and face tough questions from the press is a testament to that. It's about democracy, freedom of expression, and holding politicians accountable. Sure, it's easy to attack America and get a cheap round of applause in Europe. But when the smoke clears, what remains is our commitment to those values. We can debate the past, but our enemy is watching. They're asking if we're standing firm, or if we'll back down when things get difficult. That's a test of leadership. And it's not just for me and him; it's for everyone in politics. People may criticize politics, but when it's done right, it's about public service. We made a difficult decision, and I still believe it was the right one. History will judge us. But what we represent here today is a better way of life than brutal dictatorship or religious extremism. It's a way of life that people choose when given the chance.

And I'm absolutely confident that my administration, over the next 2 years, is going to continue to make progress in ensuring that the United States has a presence here not just for the next couple of years, but for decades to come.With respect to the Bush tax cuts, what I've said is that I'm going to meet with the--both the Republican and Democratic leaders late next week, and we're going to sit down and discuss how we move forward. My number-one priority is making sure that we make the middle class tax cuts permanent, that we give certainty to the 98 percent of Americans who are affected by those tax breaks. I don't want to see their income taxes spike up, not only because they need relief after having gone through a horrendous recession, but also because it would be bad for the economy.I continue to believe that extending permanently the upper income tax cuts would be a mistake and that we can't afford it. And my hope is, is that somewhere in between there we can find some sort of solution. But I'm not going to negotiate here in Seoul. My job is to negotiate back in Washington with Republican and Democratic leaders.Ben Feller of AP [Associated Press].", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've made very clear that you're not buying Prime Minister Netanyahu's attempts to walk back the comments that he made before the election, opposing Palestinian statehood and that you're reassessing your approach. What could Prime Minister Netanyahu do, if anything, in the short term to persuade you that he's serious about Israeli-Palestinian peace and that he's an honest broker that you could work with? Or is it too late to repair that relationship during your Presidency? And is there any truth to allegations that Israel was spying on the Iran talks? And, President Ghani, if I may, you've been working very hard to pursue reconciliation talks with the Taliban, but there's some indications that that's not going so well and that they may not be willing to sit down with you. What makes you hopeful that you can get those talks off the ground? And do you want the U.S. to be involved in those talks? [SEP] Let me, first of all, address your second question about spying allegations. As a general rule, I don't comment on intelligence matters in a big room full of reporters. [] And I think I'll continue that tradition.But with respect to the possibility of an agreement that ensures that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, we have not just briefed Congress about the progress or lack thereof that's being made, but we also brief the Israelis and our other partners in the region and around the world. And if in fact an agreement is arrived at that we feel confident will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, it's going to be there for everybody to see. And people are going to be able to lift up the hood and see what's in there.So I have confidence that if there's an agreement, it's going to be a good agreement that's good for American security and Israeli security and the region's security. And if it isn't, then there probably won't be an agreement. So there will be, I think, significant transparency in the whole process.With respect to Israel's relations with the Palestinians, I think it's important to understand that the issue here is not what I believe, but it's what the Palestinians and the parties in the negotiations and the Israeli people believe is possible. That's the most important issue. I've said before, and I'll simply repeat: Prime Minister Netanyahu, in the election runup, stated that a Palestinian state would not occur while he was Prime Minister. And I took him at his word that that's what he meant, and I think that a lot of voters inside of Israel understood him to be saying that fairly unequivocally.Afterwards, he pointed out that he didn't say never, but that there would be a series of conditions in which a Palestinian state could potentially be created. But of course, the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet anytime soon. So even if you accepted, I think, the corrective of Prime Minister Netanyahu's in subsequent days, there still does not appear to be a prospect of a meaningful framework established that would lead to a Palestinian state even if there were a whole range of conditions and security requirements that might be phased in over a long period of time, which it was always the presumption.I don't think anybody ever envisioned in any peace agreement, certainly not one that Prime Minister Netanyahu would agree to or that the Israeli people would agree to, that overnight you suddenly have a Palestinian state right next to Jerusalem and that Israel would not have a whole range of security conditions that had to be met, and that it would be phased in over a long period of time.So the issue has never been, do you create a Palestinian state overnight? The question is, do you create a process and a framework that gives the Palestinians hope, the possibility, that down the road, they have a secure state of their own, standing side by side with a secure, fully recognized Jewish State of Israel?And I think—it's not just my estimation—I think it's hard to envision how that happens based on the Prime Minister's statements. And so when I said that we have to now do an evaluation of where we are, it's not in reference to our commitment to Israel's military edge in the region, Israel's security, our intelligence cooperation, our military cooperation. That continues unabated. And I will continue to do whatever I need to do to make sure that our friends in Israel are safe. That's what I've done since I've been President, and that's not going to stop. And so the Israeli people need to know that.But I am required to evaluate honestly how we manage Israeli-Palestinian relations over the next several years. Because up until this point, the premise has been, both under Republican and Democratic administrations, that as difficult as it was, as challenging as it was, the possibility of two states living side by side in peace and security could marginalize more extreme elements, bring together folks at the center and with some common sense, and we could resolve what has been a vexing issue and one that is ultimately a threat to Israel as well.And that possibility seems very dim. That may trigger, then, reactions by the Palestinians that, in turn, elicit counterreactions by the Israelis. And that could end up leading to a downward spiral of relations that will be dangerous for everybody and bad for everybody.So bottom line, just to summarize here: Number one, our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel will continue unabated, unaffected, and we are absolutely committed to making sure that the Israeli people are safe, particularly from rocket attacks and terrorist attacks aimed on civilians.Number two, that the evaluation that's taking place is specific to what happens between Israelis and Palestinians going forward. We'll continue to engage the Israeli Government as well as the Palestinians and ask them where they are interested in going and how do they see this issue being resolved. But what we can't do is pretend that there's a possibility of something that's not there. And we can't continue to premise our public diplomacy based on something that everybody knows is not going to happen at least in the next several years. That is something that we have to, for our own—for the sake of our own credibility, I think we have to be able to be honest about that.And I guess one last point about this, because obviously, I've heard a lot of the commentary: There's a tendency, I think, in the reporting here to frame this somehow as a personal issue between myself and President—Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I understand why that's done, because when you frame it in those terms, the notion is, well, if we all just get along and everybody cools down, then somehow the problem goes away. I have a very businesslike relationship with the Prime Minister. I've met with him more than any other world leader. I talk to him all the time. He is representing his country's interests the way he thinks he needs to, and I'm doing the same.So the issue is not a matter of relations between leaders; the issue is a very clear, substantive challenge. We believe that two states is the best path forward for Israel's security, for Palestinian aspirations, and for regional stability. That's our view, and that continues to be our view. And Prime Minister Netanyahu has a different approach. And so this can't be reduced to a matter of somehow let's all hold hands and sing Kumbaya.

[SEP] As we often address in these forums, Iran persists as a recurring subject due to their disregard for global mandates concerning nuclear armament. The international community has voiced opposition to such endeavors, yet they consistently flout these directives. It is my conviction that we must fortify our sanctions regime. I have conferred with Condoleezza Rice, and we shall collaborate with our European counterparts to formulate additional sanctions. Furthermore, I shall deliberate upon this matter with Presidents Putin and Hu Jintao. It is imperative that these leaders comprehend the profoundly destabilizing impact of a nuclear-armed Iran. It is in their vested interest to collectively isolate this regime. I extend my empathy to the Iranian populace, burdened by a government that perpetuates a condemned program, thereby impeding economic prospects. Iran boasts a venerable heritage and industrious citizens who merit a more transparent society. The government's actions precipitate further isolation.

What commitments did Felipe Calderon take on in order to be a counterweight to these initiatives of Hugo Chavez, on the one hand?And on the other hand, President Felipe Calderon, Foreign Minister Patricia has said that you are working in order to strengthen the relationship with Venezuela. How is this compatible with the commitments that you're taking on with President Bush in order to give thrust to this counterweight in Latin America concerning Hugo Chavez? [SEP] Thank you for the question. We spent a lot of time talking about Mexico's role in the world. Mexico is a respected nation; President Calderon is a respected leader. But our conversations focused on democracy and rule of law and prosperity and how to improve the lives of our fellow citizens. We spent time talking about social justice and concern for the poor.One of the reasons I've come down here again is to remind people in this important part of the world that the United States cares deeply about the human condition; that we spent 1.6 billion of bilateral aid last year, most of the money going to social justice programs. And that doesn't include programs like the one I saw in the highlands of Guatemala, where our military was providing basic health care for citizens.So, Mr. President and I spent time talking about how to advance a hopeful agenda, one that will lift the spirits of people. And I respect the role Mexico plays. I mean, Mexico will lead diplomatic efforts for the common security and common prosperity, and that's an important role. The commitment and purpose of my Government is to have constructive, positive, and sound relations with all countries of the world and, of course, with the countries of Latin America, without exception. And certainly the more—the most important relationship with Mexico abroad is the one that we have with the United States, due to the migration that exists, the flows through the borders, and all else that you are well aware of.However, Mexico is respectful of the opinions of other leaders. We are respectful of the heads of states of other countries, such as Venezuela and certainly the United States. We are a government that has principles and values, values such as democracy, freedom, liberty, and legality and certainly security and safety.On the other hand, not as a strategy— this was not something that we focused on as a strategy in our talks, but as a conviction of our government. Mexico has to play a role which is balanced, weighed, and it has to be a leader in Latin America, in agreement with its culture, its history, its economy, its people.We are deeply Latin American, and we, too, want justice, development, democracy for all of Latin America.

And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other? [SEP] Well, the FBI told us they've investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years. They know him very well. But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn't know the location. They didn't know the time. They didn't know the year. They didn't know anything. And it's like, where do you go?Also, it's not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, They don't do this. And he said it very clearly. So I think when you really look at it all, it's not going to change any of the Democrats' minds. They're obstructionists.

[SEP] I would refer you to the speech that I gave when I received the Nobel Prize. And I think I started the speech by saying that, compared to previous recipients, I was certainly unworthy. But what I also described was the challenge that all of us face when we believe in peace, but we confront a world that is full of violence and occasional evil. And the question then becomes, what are our responsibilities?So I've made every effort to end the war in Iraq, to wind down the war in Afghanistan, to strengthen our commitment to multilateral action, to promote diplomacy as the solution to problems. The question, though, that all of us face—not just me, our citizens face, not just political leaders—is at what point do we say we need to confront actions that are violating our common humanity?And I would argue that when I see 400 children subjected to gas, over 1,400 innocent civilians dying senselessly in an environment in which you already have tens of thousands dying, and we have the opportunity to take some action that is meaningful, even if it doesn't solve the entire problem, may at least mitigate this particular problem, then the moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.But it's difficult.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We're all hearing a lot of encouraging promises about what Europe plans to do, but can you assure us that those actions, if they're able to come together on them, will actually do anything to create jobs in America this year? And if Europe is not able to rally in a big way pretty quickly, do you think that will cost you the election? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think that what I've heard from European leaders during the course of these discussions is they understand the stakes. They understand why it's important for them to take bold and decisive action. And I'm confident that they can meet those tests.Now, I always show great sympathy for my European friends because they don't have to deal with one Congress; they have to deal with 17 Parliaments, if you're talking about the euro zone. If you're talking about the European Union, you're talking about 27. And that means that sometimes, even after they've conceived of approaches to deal with the crisis, they have to work through all the politics to get it done. And markets are a lot more impatient.And so what I've encouraged them to do is to lay out a framework for where they want to go in increasing European integration, in resolving the financial pressures that are on sovereign countries. Even if they can't achieve all of it in one full swoop, I think if people have a sense of where they're going, that can provide confidence and break the fever. Because if you think about Europe, look, this remains one of the wealthiest, most productive regions of the world. Europe continues to have enormous strengths: a very well educated, productive workforce. They have some of the biggest, best run companies in the world. They have trading relationships around the world. And all of these problems that they're facing right now are entirely solvable, but the markets, when they start seeing potential uncertainty, show a lot more risk aversion, and you can start getting into a negative cycle.And what we have to do is it to create a positive cycle, where people become more confident, the markets settle down, and they have the time and the space to execute the kinds of structural reforms that not only Europe, but all of us are having to go through, in balancing the need for growth, but also dealing with issues like debt and deficits. And I'm confident that over the next several weeks, Europe will paint a picture of where we need to go, take some immediate steps that are required to give them that time and space. And based on the conversations that I've had here today and the conversations that I've had over the last several months, I'm confident that they are very much committed to the European project.Now, all this affects the United States. Europe as a whole is our largest trading partner. And if fewer folks are buying stuff in Paris or Berlin, that means that we're selling less stuff made in Pittsburgh or Cleveland. But I think there are a couple of things that we've already done that help. The financial regulatory reforms that we passed means that our banks are better capitalized. It means that our supervision and our mechanisms for looking at trouble spots in our financial system are superior to what they were back in 2008. That's an important difference. But there's still some more things we can do.And the most important thing we can do is something that I've already talked about. If Congress would act on a jobs plan that independent economists say would put us on the path of creating an extra million jobs on top of the ones that have already been created--putting teachers back in the classroom, putting construction workers back on the job rebuilding infrastructure that badly needs to be rebuilt--all those things can make a significant difference.

We should eliminate methane and address other issues immediately. While it seems inconsistent to push for increased oil production while advocating for emissions reductions, it's not, because we won't be able to eliminate fossil fuels immediately. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. It just strengthens the argument for a faster transition to renewable energy.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Are you willing to concede at all that what happened last night was not just an expression of frustration about the economy, but a fundamental rejection of your agenda? And given the results, who do you think speaks to the true voice of the American people right now, you or John Boehner? [SEP] I think that there is no doubt that people's number-one concern is the economy. And what they were expressing great frustration about is the fact that we haven't made enough progress on the economy. We've stabilized the economy, we've got job growth in the private sectors, but people all across America aren't feeling that progress. They don't see it. And they understand that I'm the President of the United States, and that my core responsibility is making sure that we've got an economy that's growing, a middle class that feels secure, that jobs are being created. And so I think I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make.Now, moving forward, I think the question's going to be, can Democrats and Republicans sit down together and come up with a set of ideas that address those core concerns? I'm confident that we can.I think that there are some areas where it's going to be very difficult for us to agree on, but I think there are going to be a whole bunch of areas where we can agree on. I don't think there's anybody in America who thinks that we've got an energy policy that works the way it needs to, that thinks that we shouldn't be working on energy independence. And that gives opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to come together and think about, whether it's natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric cars in this country, how do we move forward on that agenda.I think everybody in this country thinks that we've got to make sure our kids are equipped, in terms of their education, their science background, their math backgrounds, to compete in this new global economy. And that's going to be an area where I think there's potential common ground.So on a whole range of issues, there are going to be areas where we disagree. I think the overwhelming message that I hear from the voters is that we want everybody to act responsibly in Washington. We want you to work harder to arrive at consensus. We want you to focus completely on jobs and the economy and growing it, so that we're ensuring a better future for our children and our grandchildren.And I think that there's no doubt that as I reflect on the results of the election, it underscores for me that I've got to do a better job, just like everybody else in Washington does.", "label": "Dodging"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The Iran nuclear negotiators have now missed two deadlines. Should the upcoming March deadline for talks be the final one? And what are the circumstances in which you think it would be wise to extend those talks? Also, sir, some have suggested that you are outraged by the Israeli Prime Minister's decision to address Congress. Is that so? And how would you advise Democrats who are considering a boycott? [SEP] First of all, we understood, I think, from the start, when we set up the interim agreement with Iran, that it would take some time to work through incredibly complex issues and a huge trust deficit between the United States and Iran and the world and Iran, when it comes to their nuclear program. So I think there was always the assumption that, although the interim agreement lasted a certain period of time, that we would probably need more time to move forward. The good news is, is that there have been very serious discussions. That time has been well spent. During this period of time, issues have been clarified, gaps have been narrowed, the Iranians have abided by the agreement. So this is not a circumstance in which, by talking, they've been stalling and meanwhile advancing their program. To the contrary: What we know is, the program has not only been frozen, but with respect to, for example, 20 percent enriched uranium, they've reversed it. And so we're in a better position than we were before the interim program was set up.Having said all that, the issues now are sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified where we're at a point where they need to make a decision. We are presenting to them, in a unified fashion—the P-5-plus-1, supported by a coalition of countries around the world, are presenting to them a deal that allows them to have peaceful nuclear power but gives us the absolute assurance—that is verifiable—that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.And if in fact what they claim is true—which is they have no aspiration to get a nuclear weapon, that, in fact, according to their Supreme Leader, it would be contrary to their faith to obtain a nuclear weapon—if that is true, there should be the possibility of getting a deal. They should be able to get to yes. But the—we don't know if that's going to happen. They have their hardliners; they have their politics.And the point, I guess is, Christi, at this juncture, I don't see a further extension being useful if they have not agreed to the basic formulation and the bottom line that the world requires to have confidence that they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon.Now, if the framework for a deal is done, if people have a clear sense of what is required and there's some drafting and t's to cross and i's to dot, that's a different issue. But my view—and I've presented this to Members of Congress—is that we now know enough that the issues are no longer technical. The issues now are, does Iran have the political will and the desire to get a deal done?And we could not be doing this were it not for the incredible cohesion and unity that's been shown by Germany, by the other members of the P-5-plus-1, which, I should acknowledge, includes Russia. I mean, this is an area where they've actually served a constructive role. And China has served a constructive role. And there has been no cracks in this on the P-5-plus-1 side of the table. And I think that's a testament to the degree to which we are acting reasonably in trying to actually solve a problem.With respect to Prime Minister Netanyahu, as I've said before, I talk to him all the time, our teams constantly coordinate. We have a practice of not meeting with leaders right before their elections, 2 weeks before their elections. As much as I love Angela, if she was 2 weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House—[]—and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one. So the—[].So this is just—some of this just has to do with how we do business. And I think it's important for us to maintain these protocols, because the U.S.-Israeli relationship is not about a particular party. This isn't a relationship founded on affinity between the Labor Party and the Democratic Party or Likud and the Republican Party. This is the U.S.-Israeli relationship that extends beyond parties and has to do with that unbreakable bond that we feel and our commitment to Israel's security and the shared values that we have.And the way to preserve that is to make sure that it doesn't get clouded with what could be perceived as partisan politics. Whether that's accurate or not, that is a potential perception, and that's something that we have to guard against. Now, I don't want to be coy. The Prime Minister and I have a very real difference around Iran, Iran sanctions. I have been very clear—and Angela agrees with me, and David Cameron agrees with me, and the others who are a member of the negotiations agree—that it does not make sense to sour the negotiations a month or two before they're about to be completed. And we should play that out. If in fact we can get a deal, then we should embrace that. If we can't get a deal, then we'll have to make a set of decisions, and as I've said to Congress, I'll be the first one to work with them to apply even stronger measures against Iran.But what's the rush, unless your view is that it's not possible to get a deal with Iran and it shouldn't even be tested? And that I cannot agree with because, as the President of the United States, I'm looking at what the options are if we don't get a diplomatic resolution. And those options are narrow, and they're not attractive. And from the perspective of U.S. interests—and I believe from the perspective of Israel's interests, although I can't speak for, obviously, the Israeli Government—it is far better if we can get a diplomatic solution.So there are real differences substantively, but that's separate and apart from the whole issue of Mr. Netanyahu coming to Washington.

You've also heard him say—and indeed, we're truly grateful—his expansion under the agreements that we've signed of the cooperation and the assistance that we're getting from the United States.So as a country, as a government, we are satisfied with what we're doing. We need to expand that more. Because the battle that we're fighting is not a Kenyan war. Kenya just happens to be the frontier of it, being a neighbor to a country that for a long time has not had any kind of formal government. We need to work much closer together to see how we can stabilize Somalia. We need to work much closer together to see how we can help the Somali Government which is in place, work together with its regional governments in order to continuously decrease the area and the space that al-Shabaab and the like have to operate and to train and to expert terror not just to Kenya, but also to other parts of the world.So I'm looking forward to deepening the partnership that we already have. But we are satisfied with the kind of cooperation that we've had and the close working relationship between our various institutions.You raised the issue of human rights, and I mentioned earlier that the kind of fight we're having right now, this is an existential fight for us; this is something that we have not been familiar with. Kenya has always been a country that has respected different religions. This issue of terrorism is new to us. And as it is new, we learn with each and every step. We are improving our capacities and our methods of dealing with terrorism. We, as a country, are willing to learn. We have undertaken fundamental reforms in our police services to help us to deal with this particular problem. We are continuing to partner with friends, like the United States, who are giving their own experiences as to how they have handled this particular problem, and we are keen to learn and to participate.And I am certain that as we move forward, as we get better, as we learn from others, we will be able to handle the situation in a manner that does not, as said, encourage this kind of activity going forward on the basis of either marginalization or people feeling that particular communities are being targeted.As a country, we have done a lot, especially under our new Constitution, our new devolved system of government that is aimed at providing and ensuring equity and development across the country. We have put a lot of resources into some of the previously neglected areas. In fact, today, as we sit, a huge portion—approximately 40 percent—of our national budget is being invested in those areas in an attempt to ensure that all communities in our country feel that the Government is for them all and that they are part and parcel of the social-economic development of our country. So we will continue to improve. We will continue to learn. We will continue to participate with all communities, with civil society, to strengthen our partnership in order to ultimately be able to defeat this enemy.With regard the second question, just like , I think we also need to be able to speak frankly about some of these things. And the fact of the matter is that Kenya and the United States, we share so many values: our common love for democracy, entrepreneurship, value for families. These are things that we share. But there are some things that we must admit we don't share, our culture, our societies don't accept. It is very difficult for us to be able to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept.This is why I repeatedly say that, for Kenyans today, the issue of gay rights is really a nonissue. We want to focus on other areas that are day-to-day living for our people: The health issues that we have discussed with . These are critical. Issues of ensuring inclusivity and—of women, a huge section of society that is normally left out of the mainstream of economic development. What we can do in terms of infrastructure, what we can do in terms of education, in terms of our roads, in terms of giving our people power, encouraging entrepreneurship. These are the key focuses.Maybe once, like you have overcome some of these challenges, we can begin to look at new ones. But as of now, the fact remains that this issue is not really an issue that is on the foremost mind of Kenyans, and that is the fact. Yes.", "label": "Explicit"}

Such an action will only deepen their isolation and highlight the stark contrast between their leader's priorities and the needs of the North Korean people. We implore them to reconsider and embrace responsible international citizenship.

{"sentence": "Q. Would you still resist the notion that voters rejected the policy choices you made? [SEP] Well, Savannah, I think that what, I think, is absolutely true is voters are not satisfied with the outcomes. If right now we had 5 percent unemployment instead of 9.6 percent unemployment, then people would have more confidence in those policy choices. The fact is, is that for most folks, proof of whether they work or not is, has the economy gotten back to where it needs to be? And it hasn't.And so my job is to make sure that I'm looking at all ideas that are on the table. When it comes to job creation, if Republicans have good ideas for job growth that can drive down the unemployment rate and we haven't thought of them, we haven't looked at them, but we think they have a chance of working, we want to try some.So on the policy front, I think the most important thing is to say that we're not going to rule out ideas because they're Democrat or Republican.

We've surged troops twice during my tenure, and President-elect Obama seems inclined to continue that approach. This is what our top brass recommends, and we listen. Make no mistake, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Ideological conflicts are protracted affairs. As Afghanistan's civil society and political institutions mature, extremism will gradually lose its grip. I can't give you precise troop numbers, but our generals have determined that this is what we need right now, and I'm confident President-elect Obama will heed their counsel. We're deeply grateful for the support of all nations assisting Afghanistan, including Canada. Their planned troop withdrawal doesn't alter our understanding. They'll continue to contribute in other meaningful ways. The key is to relentlessly combat terrorism and bolster Afghanistan's stability through economic development and improved governance, empowering them to become self-sufficient. The Afghan people yearn to stand on their own two feet. We're immensely grateful for the international community's sacrifices. The Taliban inflicted unspeakable horrors on the Afghan people and are no longer in power. Girls are attending school, children are flying kites, health clinics are opening, and universities are flourishing. The Taliban seeks to reclaim power and despises a free society.

[SEP] First, get me the number for that family. I want to tell them personally that this administration has their back. We ended the ban on transgender troops, signed the Respect for Marriage Act, and strengthened civil rights protections for LGBT Americans. But the fight's not over. Some folks are peddling fear and prejudice. It's wrong to fire someone for being gay. It's wrong that violence against LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are targeting transgender children. These are our kids, our neighbors. They're all our kids. Our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. We're launching new initiatives to protect the LGBT community.

{"sentence": "Q. First, back to ISIS and Iraq and Syria, your very own national counterterrorism operation has found that despite all of the decisive defeats that the U.S. and coalition have dealt ISIS on the battlefield, that they've expanded their threat worldwide to include as many as 18 operational bases. In the 6 years you've been dealing, do you feel any personal disappointment that there hasn't been more progress? And in any discussions you've had with the U.S. military and your intelligence agencies, have you come up with any new ideas on how to deal or defeat ISIS? [SEP] Every time there is a terrorist attack, I feel disappointment, because I'd like to prevent all of them. And that's true not just when the attacks are in Europe or in the United States. When you read stories about attacks in Lebanon or Iraq or Afghanistan or distant parts of the world that don't get as much attention, they get my attention, because that's somebody's kid and that's somebody's mom and that's somebody who was just going about his business, and mindlessly, senselessly, this person was murdered.So I haven't gotten numb to it. It bugs me whenever it happens and wherever it happens. And we are constantly pushing ourselves to see, are there additional ideas that we can deploy to defeat this threat?Now, it is important that we recognize, terrorism as a tactic has been around for a long time. And if you look at the seventies or the eighties or the nineties, there was some terrorist activity somewhere in the world that was brutal. And as much as I would like to say that during my 8-year Presidency, we could have eliminated terrorism completely, it's not surprising that that hasn't happened, and I don't expect that will happen under the watch of my successors.I do think that because of our extraordinary efforts, the homeland is significantly safer than it otherwise would be. Now, some—in some ways, this is arguing the counterfactuals, but the attacks we prevent I take great satisfaction in, and I am grateful for the extraordinary work that our teams do. I don't think there's any doubt that had we not destroyed Al aida in the FATA that more Americans would have been killed, and we might have seen more attacks like we saw on 9/11. And we have maintained vigilance, recognizing that those threats still remain, those aspirations in the minds of these folks still remain, but it is much harder for them to carry out large-scale attacks like that than it used to be.What we have seen is that these lower level attacks carried out by fewer operatives or an individual with less sophisticated and less expensive weapons can do real damage. And that, I think, points to the need for us to not just have a military strategy, not just have a traditional counterterrorism strategy that's designed to bust up networks and catch folks before they carry out their attacks—although those still are necessary, and we have to be more and more sophisticated about how we carry those out; it still requires us to have much greater cooperation with our partners around the world—but it points to the fact that we're going to have to do a better job in draining the ideology that is behind these attacks; that right now is emanating largely out of the Middle East and a very small fraction of the Muslim world a perversion of Islam that has taken root and has been turbocharged over the Internet; and that is appealing to even folks who don't necessarily know anything about Islam and aren't even practicing Islam in any serious way, but have all kinds of psychosis and latch on to this as some way of being important and magnifying themselves.And that's tougher because that involves both changes in geopolitics in places like Syria. It requires cultural changes in regions like the Middle East and North Africa that are going through generational changes and shifts as the old order collapses. It requires psychology and thinking about how do these messages of hate reach individuals and are there ways in which we can intervene ahead of time. And all that work is being done. And we've got the very best people at it, and each day, they're making a difference in saving lives, not just here, but around the world.But it's a challenge precisely because if you're successful 99 percent of the time, that 1 percent can still mean heartbreak for families. And it's difficult because in a country, let's say, of 300 million people here in the United States, if 99.9 percent of people are immune from this hateful ideology, but one-tenth of 1 percent are susceptible to it, that's a lot of dangerous people running around. And we can't always anticipate them ahead of time because they may not have criminal records. So this is going to be a challenge.I just want to end on the point that I made earlier. How we react to this is as important as the efforts we take to destroy ISIL, prevent these networks from penetrating. You can't separate those two things out. The reason it's called terrorism, as opposed to just a standard war, is that these are weak enemies that can't match us in conventional power, but what they can do is make us scared. And when it make—and when societies get scared, they can react in ways that undermine the fabric of our society. It makes us weaker and makes us more vulnerable and creates politics that divide us in ways that hurt us over the long term.And so if we remain steady and steadfast and vigilant, but also take the long view and maintain perspective and remind ourselves of who we are and what we care about most deeply, and what we cherish and what's good about this country and what's good about the international order and civilization that was built in part because of the sacrifices of our men and women after a 20th century full of world war—if we remember that—then we're going to be okay. But we're still going to see, episodically, these kinds of tragedies, and we're going to have to keep working on it until we make things better. All right?", "label": "Explicit"}

He doesn't get a salary, nor does Ivanka, who's now in South Korea—long trip—representing her country. And we cannot get a better representative. In fact, the First Lady, Melania, was telling me what a great impression she made this morning when she landed in South Korea.Jared is truly outstanding. He was very successful when he was in the private sector. He's working on peace in the Middle East and some other small and very easy deals. They've always said peace in the Middle East, peace between the Palestinians and Israel, is the toughest deal of any deal there is.Malcolm, I've heard this all my life, that as a former dealmaker—although now you could say maybe I'm more of a dealmaker than ever before; you have no choice as President to do it right—but the hardest deal to make of any kind is between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We're actually making great headway. Jerusalem was the right thing to do. We took that off the table.But Jared Kushner is right in the middle of that, and he's an extraordinary dealmaker. And if he does that, that will be an incredible accomplishment and a very important thing for our country.So General Kelly—who's doing a terrific job, by the way—is right in the middle of that. We inherited a system that's broken. It's a system where many people have just—it's taken months and months and months to get many people that do not have a complex financial—you know, complicated financials. They don't have that, and it's still taken months. It's a broken system, and it shouldn't take this long. You know how many people are on that list, people with not a problem in the world.So that will be up to General Kelly. General Kelly respects Jared a lot, and General Kelly will make that call. I won't make that call. I will let the General, who's right here, make that call.But Jared is doing some very important things for our country. He gets paid zero. Ivanka, by the way, gets paid zero. She gave up a very good and very strong, solid big business in order to come to Washington, because she wanted to help families and she wanted to help women. She said, Dad, I want to go to Washington, I want to help women. And I said, You know, Washington is a mean place. She said: I don't care. I want to help women. I want to help families. And she was very much involved, as you know, in the child tax credit. And now she's working very much on family leave—things that I don't think would have been in the agreement if it weren't for Ivanka and some of our great Senators, et cetera. But she was very much in the forefront of that.So I will let General Kelly make that decision. And he's going to do what's right for the country. And I have no doubt he'll make the right decision.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. I want to ask about Iran. And 3 weeks ago, Iran's Supreme Leader complained that his country has not been getting actual business deals since the nuclear agreement. And non-U.S. companies are saying that it's very hard, or sometimes impossible, to do much business with Iran without at some point accessing the U.S. financial system to do U.S. dollar-denominated transactions. So my question is, are you considering allowing such transactions? And if so, is that not a betrayal of your assurances that most U.S. sanctions would stay in place? [SEP] That's not actually the approach that we're taking. So let me say broadly that so long as is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think it's important for the world community to carry out our end of the bargain.They have, in fact, based on the presentations that were made by the IAEA this morning to the P-5-plus-1, have, in fact, followed the implementation steps that were laid out. And as a consequence, sanctions related to their nuclear program have been brought down. Part of the challenge that they face is that companies haven't been doing business there for a long time and they need to get comfortable with the prospects of this deal holding.One of the things that Secretary Lew and his counterparts within the P-5-plus-1 and elsewhere are going to be doing is providing clarity to businesses about what transactions are, in fact, allowed. And it's going to take time over the next several months for companies and their legal departments to feel confident that, in fact, there may not be risks of liability if they do business with .And so some of the concerns that has expressed we are going to work with them to address. It is not necessary that we take the approach of them going through dollar-denominated transactions. It is possible for them to work through European financial institutions as well. But there is going to need to be continued clarification provided to businesses in order to—for deal flows to begin.Now, what I would say is also important is 's own behavior in generating confidence that is a safe place to do business. In a deal like this, my first priority, my first concern was making sure that we got their nuclear program stopped, and material that they already had that would give them a very short breakout capacity, that that was shipped out. That has happened. And I always said that I could not promise that would take advantage of this opportunity and this window to reenter the international community., so far, has followed the letter of the agreement. But the spirit of the agreement involves also sending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare business off. When they launched ballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel, that makes businesses nervous. There is some geopolitical risk that is heightened when they see that taking place. If you see—if continues to ship missiles to Hizballah, that gets businesses nervous. And so part of what I hope happens is we have a responsibility to provide clarity about the rules that govern so that can, in fact, benefit, the ian people can benefit from an improved economic situation. But has to understand what every country in the world understands, which is, businesses want to go where they feel safe, where they don't see massive controversy, where they can be confident that transactions are going to operate normally. And that's an adjustment that is going to have to make as well.And frankly, within , I suspect there are different views. In the same way that there are hardliners here in the United States who, even after we certify that this deal is working, even after our intelligence teams, Israeli intelligence teams, say this has been a game changer, are still opposed to the deal on principle, there are hardliners inside of who don't want to see open itself up to the broader world community and are doing things to potentially undermine the deal.And so those forces that seek the benefits of the deal not just in narrow terms, but more broadly, we want to make sure that, over time, they're in a position to realize those benefits.

But what we can do is to make sure that the kind of systemic and broad-based aggression that we've seen out of ISIL that terrorizes primarily Muslims—Shia, Sunni—terrorizes Kurds, terrorizes not just Iraqis, but people throughout the region, that that is degraded to the point where it is no longer the kind of factor that we've seen it being over the last several months.", "label": "General"}

There are always risks, which makes this a tough call. We're transitioning control to an international coalition. NATO is working out the details. We've already decreased our air presence.

Furthermore, regarding the situation back in Washington, your former attorney, Michael Cohen, who was closely associated with you for a decade, has accused you of being a liar, a conman, and a racist. What is your response to these allegations? [SEP] Well, that's just not true. And it's quite remarkable, because I tried to catch as much of it as I could. I couldn't watch too much, though, because I've been rather occupied. But I believe holding a sham hearing like that, especially during this crucial summit, is truly regrettable. They could have scheduled it a couple of days later or the following week, which would have been even more opportune. But to have it coincide with this important summit is rather unbelievable. And he made numerous false statements, but it's interesting that he didn't lie about one thing. He stated there was no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I wondered why he didn't just fabricate that as well, like he did with everything else. I mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn't claim there was collusion for this or that reason. He didn't say that. He said, No collusion. And I was somewhat impressed by that, to be honest. He could have gone all out. He only went about 95 percent instead of 100 percent. But the truth is, there is no collusion. And I refer to it as a witch hunt. This should never happen to another President. It's so detrimental to our country. So bad. When you consider this entire hoax, it's a—I call it the Russian witch hunt, and now I add the word hoax. It's a very, very bad thing for our country. But I was impressed by the fact that he—when—you know, because the most important question there was the one on collusion. And he said he saw no collusion. So we'll see what happens.

But didn't the GOP take exactly the same tactic when you were Vice President to Barack Obama? So why did you think they would treat you any differently than they treated him? [SEP] Well, first of all, they weren't nearly as obstructionist as they are now, number one. They stated that, but you had a number of Republicans we worked with closely, from John McCain—I mean, a number of Republicans we worked closely with. Even, back in those days, Lindsey Graham.And so the difference here is, there seems to be a desire to work—and I didn't say my agenda; I'm saying, what are they for? What—what is their agenda? They had an agenda back in the administration when—the 8 years we were President and Vice President, but I don't know what their agenda is now.

On the stuff that was really consequential, in terms of ideologically divisive, it was a real fight.But so—but I don't think there's a time when I—I mean, I wonder what would be the Republican platform right now. What do you think? What do you think their position on taxes are? What do you think their position on human rights is? What do you think their position is on whether or not we should—on what we should do about the cost of prescription drugs? What do you think?I mean, I just—I, honest to God, don't know what they're for, yet I know a lot of these Senators and Congressmen, and I know they do have things they want to support, whether they're things I want or not.

Looking back, do you believe that intervention was the right approach, and what lessons did you learn from that experience about the role of government in regulating the financial sector? [SEP] The financial crisis was a devastating event, and we had to act quickly to prevent a complete collapse of the economy.

They voiced their concerns about the Iraq war, which are shared by many. I reminded them that polls last fall indicated widespread disapproval of the situation in Iraq. I, too, would have expressed disapproval at that time. That's why I implemented a plan to improve the situation. I explained my decision-making process and emphasized that General Petraeus has a plan that some Members of Congress are hindering. It's illogical to unanimously confirm him and then deny him the resources needed to succeed. We must give General Petraeus a chance. He will report back to the Secretary, the Joint Chiefs, the White House, and Congress on the effectiveness of the strategy. We will then respond accordingly. Decisions about our posture in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, and General Petraeus is best suited to assess those conditions. Upon his recommendation, along with the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs, we will respond. Let's wait and see what happens and give this plan a chance to work. Let's avoid playing politics and support our troops. It's one thing to have an honest debate about Iraq, but it's another to involve our troops in that debate. They deserve the necessary funding and flexibility. This cause is necessary and noble, which is why I deployed them in the first place. It's essential for our nation's peace and security. It's noble that these citizens volunteer to serve. Congress must support them. While debating strategies is acceptable, ensuring timely funding is crucial.

Our current purchases amount to approximately 67,000 to 68,000 barrels per day, which represents only one-tenth of one percent of the 85 million barrels per day global demand. It's crucial for our national security to maintain a fully stocked SPR in the event of a major disruption. Terrorist organizations, such as Al Qaeda, might target oil facilities. An attack in a major oil-exporting country would adversely affect our economy and those who oppose such groups. The SPR is essential to mitigate such risks. If I believed it would positively influence prices, I would seriously consider it. However, given that our purchases represent only one-tenth of one percent of global demand, the cost-benefit analysis does not support such a decision.

[SEP] Alright, Roberta, those are quite the multifaceted inquiries. First, let me say that when I visit other countries, it's generally not my place to comment on ongoing elections. The relationships between nations tend to endure beyond individual leaders. Regarding Brexit, the markets seem to have stabilized somewhat. We're closely monitoring for any systemic risks, and our central banks and finance ministers are prepared. Longer-term, Brexit could hinder global growth, especially if it impacts investment in the UK and Europe. At the upcoming G-20 summit, we'll be discussing ways to boost global demand, from infrastructure improvements in the US to Germany increasing spending and Europe easing austerity measures. As for Brexit negotiations, I urge everyone to proceed in an orderly and transparent manner, understanding that both sides have a vested interest in a successful outcome. Leadership issues in the UK need resolution, and I trust Chancellor Merkel's focus is on ensuring a functional process. We'll assist where we can. Regarding a US-UK trade agreement, the UK's immediate priority will be navigating its relationship with Europe. Our special relationship with the UK remains unchanged, rooted in shared values and cooperation. However, their absence from the EU could complicate addressing other global challenges.

And on Cuba, did you discuss the 45-day waiting period for removing them from the terrorism list with President Castro? Are there any obstacles to opening embassies after removal? [SEP] On Iran, the framework has specifics, like centrifuge cuts and Fordow's conversion. But details matter and will be negotiated. It's wrong to say it's all done. The framework, if implemented, stops Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, but details are key. Tough talks are coming, as I've said. We had similar issues with the interim agreement, but it worked out. On Cuba, we didn't discuss those details. I'll review the terrorism list recommendation, and Congress will too. Embassy concerns are probably on Cuba's side, since they haven't had one in a while. It's a bigger change for them. We're ready to move forward, improve dialogue, and help the Cuban people.

[SEP] We're open to considering any requests from the Chilean government for information regarding the past, and we're willing to cooperate. It's vital to understand our history. The relationship between the U.S. and Latin America has certainly had its rocky periods. But while we acknowledge the past, we shouldn't let it define us.

{"sentence": "Q. Are there steps your administration can take now to build confidence that the U.S. will, in fact, meet its deficit reduction goals in the medium and long term? [SEP] The several steps we've already begun to take, number one, as I indicated, the budget that we're presenting, 3 years discretionary domestic spending freeze. And I've sent a clear signal to the leadership when we met, even if we do not get the entire budget package passed through Congress, that top line number needs to stay firm. And I'm serious about it.We've initiated a whole host of measures to cut programs that aren't working, including, by the way, in the defense area. Bob Gates has been, I think, as successful as any Secretary of Defense in recent memory in actually killing programs, which, I think, anybody who follows Washington knows is very tough, very difficult.We have instituted PAYGO. And although there were baselines built in that took into account the fact that some of this stuff was not going to be solved overnight, it is starting to provide budget discipline to Congress as they move forward.And we have set up this Fiscal Commission, who will provide reports starting in November. And one of the encouraging things--although there was resistance, ironically, on the part of some of the Republicans who originally had been cosponsors of legislation to create the Fiscal Commission, and they, in fact, ended up voting against it--what's been encouraging, based on what I'm hearing both from Democrats and Republicans, is that there's been a serious conversation there. People are looking at a whole spectrum of issues to get at what is basically a structural deficit that preceded this financial crisis.Even if--the financial crisis made it much worse, but even if we had not gone through this financial crisis, we'd still have to be dealing with these long-term deficit problems. They have to do with Medicaid; they have to do with Medicare; they have to do with Social Security. They have to do with a series of structural problems that are not unique to America. Some of it has to do with an aging population. And we've got to look at a tax system that is messy and unfair in a whole range of ways.And so they're looking at the gamut of steps that are going to be taken. And one of the interesting things that's happened over the last 18 months as President is, for some reason, people keep on being surprised when I do what I said I was going to do. So I say, I'm going to reform our health care system, and people think, well, gosh, that's not smart politics, maybe we should hold off. Or I say, we're going to move forward on don't ask, don't tell, and somehow people say, Well, why are you doing that? I'm not sure that's good politics.I'm doing it because I said I was going to do it, and I think it's the right thing to do. And people should learn that lesson about me, because next year, when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step up, because I'm calling their bluff. And we'll see how much of that--how much of the political arguments they're making right now are real and how much of it was just politics.All right?

{"sentence": "Q. What about long-term about the electoral college? [SEP] Long-term with respect to the electoral college, the electoral college is a vestige, it's a carryover from an earlier vision of how our Federal Government was going to work that put a lot of premium on States, and it used to be that the Senate was not elected directly, it was through State legislatures. And it's the same type of thinking that gives Wyoming two Senators and—with about half a million people, and California with 33 million get the same two.So there are some structures in our political system, as envisioned by the Founders, that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats. But the truth of the matter is, is that, if we have a strong message, if we're speaking to what the American people care about, typically, the popular vote and the electoral college vote will align.And I guess part of my overall message here, as I leave for the holidays, is that if we look for one explanation or one silver bullet or one easy fix for our politics, then we're probably going to be disappointed. There are just a lot of factors in what's happened not just over the last few months, but over the last decade, that has made both politics and governance more challenging. And I think everybody has raised legitimate questions and legitimate concerns.I do hope that we all just take some time, take a breath—this is certainly what I'm going to advise Democrats—to just reflect a little bit more about, how can we get to a place where people are focused on working together based on at least some common set of facts? How can we have a conversation about policy that doesn't demonize each other? How can we channel what I think is the basic decency and goodness of the American people so it reflects itself in our politics, as opposed to it being so polarized and so nasty that, in some cases, you have voters and elected officials who have more confidence and faith in a foreign adversary than they have in their neighbors?And those go to some bigger issues. How is it that we have some voters or some elected officials who think that Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiative and school nutrition program is a greater threat to democracy than our Government going after the press if they're issuing a story they don't like? Right? I mean, that's an issue that I think we've got to wrestle with, and we will.People have asked me, how do you feel after the election and so forth, and I say, well, look, this is a clarifying moment. It's a useful reminder that voting counts, politics counts. What the President-elect is going to be doing is going to be very different than what I was doing, and I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what worked for the American people.And I hope that, building off the progress we've made, that what the President-elect is proposing works. What I can say with confidence is that what we've done works. Now, that I can prove. I can show you where we were in 2008, and I can show you where we are now, and you can't argue that we're not better off. We are. And for that, I thank the American people and, more importantly, I thank—well, not more importantly, as importantly—I was going to say Josh Earnest for doing such a great job as—[]. For that, I thank the American people. I thank the men and women in uniform who serve.

Now, I was in front of Marines, so I had to, like, tamp it down. []But it was just one small example of all the people who have contributed to our success. I'm responsible for where we've screwed up.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, can you shed light on the widespread discontent among Democrats concerning the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy in the recent tax legislation? Do you feel that your characterization of these tax cuts as 'morally inappropriate' contributes to this division? [SEP] I acknowledge the frustration. I've articulated before, and I'll reiterate: I don't believe we can sustain tax breaks for individuals who are already affluent. They prospered during Bill Clinton's presidency. This will be a recurring debate over the ensuing years. Upon the swearing-in of the new Congress, we'll need to deliberate on how to achieve a balanced budget. This necessitates curtailing ineffective programs, but also honestly addressing the funding of essential priorities. If we aim to provide adequate care for our veterans, we must allocate funds for the requisite medical personnel and facilities. If we aspire for our children's success, we must invest in education. If we seek to maintain our competitiveness, we must invest in basic research. We must weigh the option of maintaining tax cuts for the wealthy against investing in these priorities. I comprehend why some Democrats, and even some Republicans, believe we could have dispensed with that aspect of the tax package. However, compromise entails accepting certain unfavorable elements. The overall package was the appropriate one to stimulate economic growth and job creation.

This person has been involved in the deaths of hundreds of Turkish civilians and is seen as a close associate of Abdullah Öcalan, the terrorist leader imprisoned in Turkey. Such an individual should not be welcomed by the United States, nor by Russia. It's challenging to comprehend this when we're committed to fighting terrorism globally.

Prime Minister Trudeau and President Peña Nieto, why are you hesitant to openly criticize Mr. Trump's policies, especially concerning NAFTA and the proposed border wall? [SEP] Okay, Roberta, those are a lot of questions packed into one. Let me start by saying that when I'm visiting other countries, it's not really my job to comment on candidates in the middle of an election. The relationship between governments usually lasts longer than whoever's in power at the time. As for Brexit, the markets seem to have settled down a little. We're keeping a close eye on things to make sure there aren't any major problems, and our central banks are ready. In the long run, Brexit could slow down global growth if it makes it harder to invest in the UK and Europe. At the G-20, we'll be talking about how to boost global demand, from fixing infrastructure in the US to Germany spending more and Europe loosening up on spending cuts. When it comes to Brexit negotiations, I think everyone needs to take a deep breath and come up with a plan that's clear and makes sense, knowing that both sides need to get this right. The UK needs to sort out its leadership situation, and I'm confident Chancellor Merkel wants things to work out. We'll help however we can. As for a trade deal between the US and the UK, their first concern is going to be figuring out their relationship with Europe. Our special relationship with the UK is still strong, based on shared values and working together. But their leaving the EU could make it harder for us to deal with other global issues.

[SEP] Well, I think you can look at your Senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people. But what we're looking for is corruption. An investigation started, called the Russian witch hunt, affectionately. And it was a total phony scam. It was set up by people within the Government to try and stop somebody from getting elected.And after that person—namely, me—won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the electoral college—which, by the way, when you run a race, if you're running electoral—you know, if you go by the college, electoral college, that's a much different race than running popular vote.

You train differently.And I can't help it that my opponent didn't go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places. But that's the way it is. We won an election convincingly. Convincingly. And then, you had the text message on, Well, if she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy. How bad was that? You know the insurance policy?

I'm going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words. And then, we'll do a couple of more questions. Mr. President, I thought I'd start by talking about Iran. We had a productive week. We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is just not going to work. It's not going to solve the world's problems, it's not going to create Middle East stability.Then, we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well. The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter. We want peace. We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran. We're hoping we can get that way. In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they'll choose violence and hate and—as the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly—if their bloodthirst will continue.We hope that's the—[inaudible]. We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that's good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world. And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days. Thank you. The President. Thank you, Mike. As Secretary Pompeo said, on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program. The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent.And then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to DC.

Permanent tax cuts provide stability. Second, we need a comprehensive energy policy. Renewables and conservation are important, but we also need to find more oil and gas here at home to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This is a transition period to new technologies. We haven't built a refinery in ages. I even suggested building them on old military bases, but Congress didn't bite. Less supply plus steady demand equals higher prices. We need to explore ANWR, with responsible environmental mitigation. And taxing oil companies? That'll just make prices worse. We need to encourage domestic investment.

But I think what's happened over the last several weeks is not a victory for me, it's a victory for the American people. And the lesson I hope that everybody takes from this is that it's possible for Democrats and Republicans to have principled disagreements, to have some lengthy arguments, but to ultimately find common ground to move the country forward.That's what we did with taxes. Those arguments have not gone away. I still believe that it doesn't make sense for us to provide tax cuts to people like myself who don't need them when our deficit and debts are growing. That's a debate that's going to continue into 2011, and I know the Republicans feel just as strongly on the other side of that.I think that we're still going to have disagreements in terms of spending priorities. It's vital for us to make investments in education and research and development--all those things that create an innovative economy--while at the same time cutting those programs that just aren't working.

Your Secretary of State said today he thought he could invade at any moment. You've seen the cyber attacks. And you've seen the demand that he have a sphere of influence in which you would withdraw all American troops and nuclear weapons from what used to be the Soviet bloc.So I'm wondering if you still think that the last thing he wants is a cold war.

My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.And by the way, I've indicated to him—the two things he said to me that he wants guarantees of: One is, Ukraine will never be part of NATO. And two, that NATO, or the—there will not be strategic weapons stationed in Ukraine. Well, we could work out something on the second piece, depending what he does along the Russian line as well—or the Russian border, in the European area of Russia.On the first piece, we have a number of treaties internationally and in Europe that suggest that you get to choose who you want to be with. But the likelihood that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the near term is not very likely, based on much more work they have to do in terms of democracy and a few other things going on there and whether or not the major allies in the west would vote to bring Ukraine in right now.So there's room to work if he wants to do that.

[SEP] Well, isn't that precisely what he was doing all along? Look, this whole witch hunt, it's a disgrace, and hopefully, the truth will come out. There are some great books coming out that expose what they did to us. They've hurt this country very badly. No President should have to go through what I've gone through. The President of Ukraine is trying to stop corruption. There was corruption. Senators threatened him with votes and money. That's what they're trying to say I did, but I didn't. The call was perfect. There was no quid pro quo, unlike Biden and those Senators. We have an honest group of people being unfairly maligned. I'm very happy. A recent poll had me at 53. Add 10 points to any poll for Trump.

We're not going to telegraph our strategy to the Chinese, but we're looking at everything from WTO challenges to working with our allies to put pressure on them. We're not ruling anything out. The key is to get them to understand that they need to play by the rules, and we're going to use every tool at our disposal to make that happen.

Yes, specifically the areas where we're seeing pressure in the supply chain are surface cleaners, cleaning supplies, paper goods, in particular.

Historically, we've aimed to align the G-8 summit with the NATO summit to streamline travel for the leaders involved. We did this last year in France, and we're continuing the trend. The notion of Camp David arose after the initial planning for the NATO summit. It was suggested that I hadn't yet hosted my counterparts at Camp David during my tenure. The G-8 tends to foster a more relaxed environment where we can engage in informal discussions on various topics. We believed that a more casual setting would be conducive to productive dialogue. The weather should be favorable at that time. It will also afford me the opportunity to engage with Mr. Putin, the new Russian President. Subsequently, we will proceed to Chicago.

Are you open to meeting with him? Would you be willing to meet with him without condition? Or would you demand that a strict set of parameters be placed around any encounter between you and the Special Counsel?

When I watch you interviewing all the people leaving their committees—I mean, the Democrats are all running for office, and they're trying to say this, that. But bottom line, they all say there's no collusion. And there is no collusion.And when you talk about interviews, Hillary Clinton had an interview where she wasn't sworn in, she wasn't given the oath, they didn't take notes, they didn't record, and it was done on the Fourth of July weekend. That's perhaps ridiculous, and a lot of people looked upon that as being a very serious breach. And it really was.But again, I'll speak to attorneys. I can only say this: There was absolutely no collusion. Everybody knows it. Every committee—I've been in office now for 11 months. For 11 months, they've had this phony cloud over this administration, over our Government. And it has hurt our Government.

Leaders and ordinary people appreciate our work on economic and development programs, war legacy issues, and civil society. Their concern is whether it will continue. My successor should maintain this engagement, given the dynamic populations and growing economies here. Regarding Guantanamo, I won't concede it will remain open. We're working to reduce the population. It's a recruitment tool for terrorists, hinders counterterrorism cooperation, and is unnecessary and costly.

If they really want to help Iraq, there are concrete things they can do, like stopping the flow of weapons and suicide bombers. We welcome their statements, but their actions will tell us if they're serious. The conference was beneficial because it got regional players to publicly commit to supporting Iraq's young democracy. That's a positive thing. Also, the Iraqi government gained confidence from engaging with nations from around the world in a constructive way. Iraq's success depends on its government's ability to make tough decisions. They're transitioning from tyranny to democracy quickly, and the conference will help them reconcile their differences.

The reason I wanted to close Guantanamo was to keep Americans safe. Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for terrorists. They use it on their websites and in their messages. I believe we can keep Americans safe and go after terrorists. My administration has been aggressive in going after Al Qaida. They are more hunkered down than they have been since 2001. They have reduced financing and operational capacity. It is important to live up to our values. Closing Guantanamo is about that. It's become a symbol. We can house them somewhere else. I won't comment on a review I haven't received yet. We've been trying to put our battle against terrorists within a legal structure. One of the toughest problems is what to do with dangerous people who are enemies of the United States, but it is difficult to try them. Releasing them could create greater danger. We need to make sure these folks have lawyers and can challenge their detention, but we are not releasing folks who could do us harm.

Are there any preconditions or is there anything that North Korea must do for them to be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism? [SEP] Yes. The 12th is the first opportunity where they may be lifted off the list. And, yes, they got a lot to do. They got to, like, show us a verification regime that we can trust. This is a stepby-step process.I don't know whether or not they're going to give up their weapons. I really don't know. I don't think either of us knows. I know this, that the six-party talks is the best way to convince them to give up their weapons. I know there's a framework in place that will make it easier for those of us who care about this issue to work together to send a common message to the leader: You have a choice to make: You can verifiably do what you say you're going to do, or you'll continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world.We have put out a step-by-step process to—as a way forward for the n leader. This isn't a U.S. proposal; this is a five-party proposal. South Korea has been a very integral part of the process, and they will remain an integral part of the process. We're all at the table together, saying the same thing.And so part of the step-by-step was to say, okay, if you do the following things like you said you would do, you get off the terrorist list. That could conceivably happen, as you mentioned, on the 12th. However, it's going to require action on the leader of 's part. It just doesn't automatically happen.We changed the way it used to be. It used to be that—okay, we'll give you something and hope that you end up responding. It's no longer that way. The six-party talks basically says, you have made a promise; once you fulfill your promise, then something will happen positively. And so I— we'll see. It's his choice to make as to whether or not he gets to come off the list. If he is off the list, I want to remind you that he'll still be—they will still be the most sanctioned country in the world.And so then the fundamental question is, do they want to continue on and try to change the status?

It's all in the details; experts need to agree on confidence-building stuff and how to make it work. Working together on a global missile defense system is what we want. If we can work together in our area and then around the world, that's good for us. Russia's worried the system's aimed at them, so they'll do something about it. I think it's defense, not offense. We gotta show the experts it's not aimed at Russia, but to deal with threats we all face. As for the Czech Republic and Poland, their leaders need to see Russia as a friend, not an enemy. We'll sort things out. Transparency means being open, not just giving briefings. I'm happy to share tech and info to show it's for single/dual-launch threats, not Russia's power.

I mean, I don't know that a government, as big as we are, could do tests like this. We've made it possible for them to do the tests in rapid fashion.But when they come back, and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works, and they're coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with, I don't see any reason why it should be delayed further.

Yes, I mean there is no—I think that people don't understand what's going on with Operation Warp Speed. It's unprecedented what's happened here.A typical vaccine takes roughly 4 years or so, and now we're going to have a vaccine—highly likely—in far less than 1 year, but without cutting any safety corners, because the President has done things concomitant to the development of the vaccine: that is, the manufacturing and the logistics. Everything is being done at the same time, and that's never been done before.But there is zero cutting of safety concerns. There is—there should be no hesitation about the safety.

{"sentence": "You've mentioned your 'microphone' is now more effective in addressing domestic priorities like Social Security and immigration, despite previous efforts falling short. With the Democratic Congress now in power, how do you intend to amplify your message and achieve different results? [SEP] By 'loud microphone,' I mean I can draw attention to important issues. That's what a President does. But to get things done, we need bipartisan cooperation, which the election results made clear. We've had some legislative successes. We reformed Medicare, put in place tax policies that encourage growth, passed trade initiatives, and an energy bill. I'm signing another energy bill today, extending tax credits for R&D. It's a pretty good record. However, with the Democrats now controlling Congress, we need a new approach. I'll work with their leaders and our own to find common ground on key issues like Social Security and immigration. We must get comprehensive immigration reform done this year. To secure our border, Border Patrol needs a plan that allows people to come here legally to do jobs Americans aren't doing. Recent enforcement actions at packing plants showed that many illegal workers were using forged documents. This system forces people to rely on smugglers and forgers. It's inhumane. The best way to enforce our borders humanely is with a comprehensive bill. I've proposed a plan and spoken about it from the Oval Office. The 'microphone' is necessary to call people to action. I want to work with both Republicans and Democrats. On energy, we can also work together. There's agreement that we need to continue researching alternative forms of energy. We're making progress. I'm looking forward to working with them. Some say that because I lost Congress, nothing will get done. I disagree. I want to get things done, and the Democratic leaders want to show they're worthy of their leadership roles. We can find common ground without either of us compromising our principles. The American people are sick of the partisanship. I'll do my part to elevate the tone. I was Governor of Texas with a Democratic legislature, and we got a lot of constructive things done.

{"sentence": "Q. Are you getting all the intelligence and information you need from the Russians? And should Americans be worried when they go to big, public events now? [SEP] The Russians have been very cooperative with us since the Boston bombing. Obviously, old habits die hard; there's still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the cold war. But they're continually improving. I've spoken to President Putin directly. He's committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation, but how do we work on counterterrorism issues generally.In terms of whatthe response of the American people, I think everybody can take a cue from Boston. You don't get a sense that anybody is intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple days after the bombing. There are joggers right now, I guarantee you, all throughout Boston and Cambridge and Watertown. And I think one of the things that I've been most proud of in watching the country's response to the terrible tragedy there, is a sense of resilience and toughness. And we're not going to be intimidated. We are going to live our lives.And people, I think, understand that we've got to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of attacks from taking place, but people also understandin the same way they understand after a shooting in Aurora or Newtown or Virginia Tech or after the foiled attempts in Times Square or in Detroitthat we're not going to stop living our lives because warped, twisted individuals try to intimidate us.

Do you still believe the UK should be at the back of the queue for a US trade deal? And will you actively promote the TPP while campaigning for Secretary Clinton? [SEP] Roberta, those are excellent questions. I'll even help my friends out a bit on that last one. When I visit other countries, it's not my place to comment on candidates in the middle of a race. Governments tend to transcend whoever is in power. With respect to Brexit, the markets seem to have settled down a bit. We're monitoring for any systemic strains. Central banks and our Treasury Secretary have prepared well. There are longer-term concerns about global growth if Brexit freezes investment in Great Britain or Europe. We need to boost global demand. Whether it's the US improving infrastructure, or Germany spending more, or China shifting to domestic-based growth. With respect to Brexit negotiations, my message is: everyone should catch their breath, come up with an orderly, transparent plan. Both sides have a stake in getting this right. Leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved quickly. Chancellor Merkel's interest is in making sure the process works. We'll help in any way we can. As for the UK and a trade agreement, they'll be the least of their problems right now. Their first order of business is Europe. But the special relationship with Great Britain doesn't change. The ties are deep and long-lasting. Our relationship with the UK fundamentally doesn't change. Their absence from the EU makes it harder to solve other challenges. Our relationship goes far deeper than any individual leaders. Canada, the US, and Mexico will continue to have close relationships. I look forward to working with whomever the American people elect as their President. I know we will always be able to find shared priorities. My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. We are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. In the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.We have reached so far—the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world—without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society—or the societies, at least, of our three countries—had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past—and President Obama already said it, even years back—but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind.", "label": "Implicit"}

We're prioritizing nations that invest in their people, fight corruption, and build market economies. This visit is a reminder that supporting such nations is in our national and moral interest, even if we haven't always had strong ties.

The CDC's communication strategies have been a subject of scrutiny. However, these are scientists adapting to an unprecedented situation. This is analogous to historical public health challenges, such as polio, where initial recommendations underwent revisions. This is a novel virus, a novel phenomenon.

How do you respond to these accusations? [SEP] Well, that's simply incorrect. And it's quite fascinating, because I tried to watch as much as I could.

And I said, I wonder why he didn't just lie about that, too, like he did about everything else?

Additionally, did your discussions include U.S. intelligence assessments regarding the likelihood of Russian escalation after the delivery of the Patriot missile system? [SEP] Permit me to respond to the first aspect of your question. As I've often stated, personal engagement is of utmost importance. There is no substitute for direct interaction, regardless of whether one is dealing with a friend or an opponent. That is precisely what occurred today, and we shall persist in this approach. As winter descends, Putin is intensifying his attacks on civilian targets, including women, children, and orphanages. His behavior is abhorrent, and ultimately, he will be unsuccessful. He has already failed in his primary objective of seizing control of all of Ukraine, as the Ukrainian populace will never embrace his authority. It was imperative to convey to the global community that President Zelenskyy and I stand united.

I'd rather receive a comprehensive briefing from our embassy, who will undoubtedly consult with the Prime Minister, before offering a definitive evaluation.

Beyond preventing a national catastrophe, how can the average citizen measure the success of your programs? Should they look at the stock market, foreclosures, or unemployment? What metrics are key, and when will we know if Plan A is working, or if we need a Plan B? [SEP] Look, the most immediate indicator is job creation, plain and simple. Saving or creating 4 million jobs is the first benchmark. When people are employed, they have the confidence to spend, to invest. Businesses see that consumer confidence and start investing themselves, which leads to more hiring. So, job creation is priority number one. Secondly, are the credit markets functioning properly? I hear from countless successful businesses that can't access credit. In Elkhart, Indiana, the RV capital, customers with good credit can't get RV loans, and businesses can't get loans to pay their suppliers. Normalizing the credit markets is crucial. Thirdly, housing: have we stabilized the market? The Federal Government doesn't have complete control, but our plan, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, aims to slow foreclosures and stabilize housing values. Ultimately, success is measured by stopping contraction and job losses, and starting to grow again. I don't have a crystal ball, and this is an unprecedented crisis.

So, we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement to ensure a consistent approach for asylum seekers crossing between official points. This was always the theoretical solution, but implementing it required navigating complex border management processes.

A key part of this is a security agreement. They're aiming for a swift transition to what we call 'overwatch,' where the U.S. focuses on training, logistical support, and special operations.

The fact that oil companies are drilling a mile underwater and then three miles *below* that tells you something about where the industry is headed. It's more expensive, it's riskier. That's why you never heard me say 'Drill, baby, drill.' We can't drill our way out of this. Oil's part of the mix, sure, but we need to transition to new technologies. The easy oil's gone.

{"sentence": "In light of the bipartisan opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, can you outline your strategy for overcoming congressional hurdles and resolving the current impasse in the Senate? [SEP] Well, the reason a consensus bill hasn't emerged in the Senate is because this is a complex issue requiring bipartisan cooperation. It's crucial to first establish a coherent Republican position in the Senate, which is where we're currently focusing our efforts. Senator Kennedy will lead the bill on the Democrat side. Once we achieve a unified Republican stance, one that most Republicans support, we'll collaborate with the Senator. Without sufficient consensus, nothing will pass the Senate, and consequently, nothing will happen in the House. Therefore, the initial stages of crafting a bill that addresses concerns are time-consuming but essential to address the issues raised during the last immigration reform debate. I'm optimistic that we can achieve something, and we're beginning to find common ground. There's broad agreement on a temporary-worker plan allowing individuals to legally come to the U.S. for jobs Americans aren't doing. This would greatly benefit Guatemalan citizens, eliminating the need to enter the country illegally, pay smugglers, or live in hiding. They'd be able to enter legally. Secondly, they'd be able to return home to their families legally, without fear. There would be a time limit, which is part of the negotiations. The difficult issue is what to do with those who've been in our country for an extended period. This is a sensitive issue with significant political implications. Automatic citizenship is unacceptable to many in our country. The challenge is to design a system that alleviates these concerns.", "label": "General"}

On Paris, it's vital to show that terrorists can't stop the world. We won't succumb to fear. We're hunting them down, cutting off their financing, and countering their narrative.

The thought of their taxes going up too? That's a recipe for disaster. Secondly, we need a serious energy policy. I'm all for renewables, but we can't ignore the reality of our current needs. We need to be drilling for more oil and gas right here at home. It's a temporary fix, sure, but it's a necessary one while we transition to new technologies. We haven't built a new refinery in years! I even proposed using old military bases, but Congress didn't go for it. Basic economics: less supply, same demand, prices go up. And this talk of taxing oil companies?

It's about having an open and honest dialogue, finding common ground, and addressing disagreements constructively.

We need to fix the root causes: poverty and inequality. People don't leave home because they want to; they have to. We're putting money into development in El Salvador, Honduras, and soon Guatemala and Belize, so people can choose to stay. We're not building migration centers, but helping with shelters, healthcare, and food. We're happy the US has a plan for Venezuelans, which is making things safer.

And concerning North Korea, if sanctions prove ineffective, are all options still on the table, including military action? [SEP] Well, regarding the second part, we'll just have to see what happens. I'm not going to telegraph my moves. But if the sanctions don't work, we'll have to go to phase two. And phase two could be very rough, very unfortunate for the world. But we're hoping the sanctions will work. We have tremendous support all around the world for what we're doing. It really is a rogue nation. If we can make a deal, it'll be a great thing. And if we can't, something will have to happen. So we'll see.As far as General Mattis is concerned, he has that view, and a lot of people share that view. China is tough. They're getting stronger, to a large extent, with a lot of the money they've made from having poor leadership in the United States, because the United States leadership has allowed them to get away with murder.With that being said, I think we can have a truly great, even trading relationship with China. Hopefully, that's going to work out. And hopefully, the relationship I have with President Xi will make that happen. Only time will tell.I can confirm that President Trump and President Xi see eye-to-eye in every respect. The respect they have for each other is very clear at the meetings I've been at, which we've attended in the region—the East Asia Summit, and so forth, APEC—it's the most important relationship, characterized by respect, frankness, and clear-eyedness.For our own part, we see China's rise as being overwhelmingly positive for the region and for the world. The critical thing, of course, is the rule of law is maintained.There are people who want to try to paint the United States and its allies, like Australia, as being against China in some sort of rerun of the cold war. That is not appropriate. It's not accurate.What we need to ensure is that the rules of the road, the rule of law, the rules-based system, where big countries can't push around little countries; where, to quote Lee Kuan Yew all those years ago, where you don't have a world where the big fish eat the little fish and the little fish eat the shrimps. Where you have that rule of law that protects everybody, that is what has enabled the great growth in our region. That's what's enabled hundreds of millions of people in our region, and including in China, to be lifted out of poverty. So maintaining that rules-based order is what we are committed to, and we all have a vested interest in doing so.I don't think we've ever had a better relationship with China than we do right now. The only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it's so one-sided, it's so lopsided. And the people that stood here for many years in this position should never have allowed that to happen. It's very unfair to the United States, and it's very unfair to the workers of the United States.Even today, it's extremely hard on companies that want to do business in China, because the barriers are incredible, whereas the barriers coming into our country are foolishly not. I believe in reciprocal trade. If they do something to us, we do something to them. Well, that never happened, and it's gotten worse and worse over the years. But we'll correct it. That can be the only thing that can get in the way of a truly long-term, great relationship, because we have all the ingredients for friendship.From the Washington Examiner, Gabby [Gabby Morrongiello, Washington Examiner].", "label": "General"}

We've just learned of four American servicemembers killed in Iraq. My heart goes out to their families. The moment I truly felt the weight of the presidency was signing letters to the families of our fallen. It's a constant reminder of the responsibility. Regarding media access to the return of our fallen, we're actively reviewing those policies in consultation with the Department of Defense. I'll refrain from commenting until that review is complete. Afghanistan presents a significant challenge. Thanks to the efforts of our troops and Ambassador Crocker, Iraq held a relatively peaceful election. The political system seems to be taking root. We haven't seen the same progress in Afghanistan. The government seems disconnected. The Taliban and Al Qaida operate in the FATA region. We haven't seen a sustained effort to eliminate those safe havens. We're conducting a comprehensive review. General Petraeus and Richard Holbrooke are working on a regional strategy. We need better coordination between our military, diplomatic, and development efforts. This will be difficult, but Afghanistan was the launchpad for the 9/11 attacks.

{"sentence": "Q. ——of inflation. Oil prices have been at about a 7-year high recently. How long should Americans expect to face higher prices when they're at the grocery store or when they're at the gas pump? Is this something that they're going to see into the summer, into next fall?And separately, you know, you talk about the importance of the Fed, but isn't that an acknowledgment that you're limited in what you can do if you—if you're relying on the Fed to make decisions and you're unable to get a Build Back Better proposal through, aren't you simply limited in what you can do to deal with inflation? [SEP] Well, look, as you know, Ken, the inflation has everything to do with the supply chain. And I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to make progress on speeding up the access to materials. For example, one third of the cost—of the increase in cost of living is the cost of automobiles.The reason automobiles have skyrocketed in price is because of the lack of computer chips. So we have the capacity, and we're going to do everything in our power to do it to become self-reliant on the computer chips that we need in order to be able to produce more automobiles. That's underway.We've already passed, within the context of another bill, money for that in the—in the House of Representatives. It's before the House of Representatives now. But I think there's a way we can move to—if we can move to get, for example, that one thing done, it can make a big difference in terms of the cost of—the total cost of living.Now, with regard to the whole issue of energy prices, that gets a little more complicated. But you saw what happened when I was able to convince everyone from—including China, India—a number of other countries—to agree with us to go into their version of the—of their petroleum reserve to release more into the market so that—that brought down the price about 12, 15 cents a gallon in some places, some places more.There's going to be a reckoning along the line here as to whether or not we're going to continue to see oil prices continue to go up in ways that are going up now, relative to what is going to—what impact that's going to have on the producers.And so it's going to be hard. I think that's the place where most middle class people, working class people get hit the most. They pull up to a pump, and all of a sudden, instead of paying $2.40 a gallon, they're paying $5 a gallon. And that's going to be really difficult.But—so we're going to continue to work on trying to increase oil supplies that are available. And I think there's ways in which we can be of some value added in terms of the price of gas—natural gas and the like—to take the burden off of European countries that are now totally dependent on Russia. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be very hard.But I think that we have to deal with—for example, like I said, you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid. Well, one of the reasons for that is, you don't have that many folks out there that are ones that are—we've got the Big Four controlling it all.And so you're going to see, more and more, we're going to move on this competition piece to allow more and more smaller operations to come in and be able to engage in providing—buying and providing the access to much cheaper meat than exists now. But it's going to be a haul.Now, and as you—I assume the reason you said if I can't get Build Back Better is, it relates to what those 17 Nobel laureate economists said: that if in fact we could pass it, it would actually lower the impact on inflation, reduce inflation over time, et cetera.So there's a lot we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but I think we can get it done. But it's going to be painful for a lot of people in the meantime. That's why the single best way—the single best way—to take the burden off middle class and working class folks is to pass the Build Back Better piece that are things that they're paying a lot of money for it now.If you get to trade off higher gas as—you're putting up with a higher price of hamburgers and gas, versus whether or not you're going to have to—you're going to be able to pay for education and/or childcare and the like, I think most people would make the trade. Their bottom line would be better in middle class households.But it's going to be hard. And it's going to take a lot of work.", "label": "Deflection"}

How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here? [SEP] Let's be clear, Manning served hard time. Anyone thinking about leaking secrets shouldn't think it's a free pass. She went to trial, due process was followed, she took responsibility. But her sentence was way out of line compared to others, and she served a good chunk of it. Commuting, not pardoning, felt right. Justice was served, and the message is still clear: use the proper channels, the whistleblower protections. I know some think they aren't enough, but national security is at stake, people's lives are on the line. As for WikiLeaks, I haven't really commented on them. The intel community wasn't conclusive about their connection to the Russian hacking. I don't follow Assange's tweets. The Justice Department handles his case. We need to balance accountability and openness in this cyber age, but also protect ourselves from those who want to harm us. With Manning, I looked at the specifics, like I do with all these cases, and commuting her sentence was the right thing to do.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

[SEP] Well, I'm not prepared to do that in detail, in terms of the Executive orders I may be able to engage in and other things I can do. But one of—the things we have done: We have significantly beefed up a number of enforcers in the Justice Department, who are there to challenge these unconstitutional efforts—in our view—unconstitutional efforts on the part of the Republicans to stack the election and subvert the outcome.We have begun to organize in ways that we didn't before in communities beyond the civil rights community to make the case to the rest of American people what's about to happen, what will happen if in fact these things move forward.If I had talked to you—not you; I'm using you in a total sense.

[SEP] Regarding TPP, having spent time in the Senate, I know trade deals are always challenging, particularly with numerous stakeholders. Each party seeks optimal terms, and during an election year, political maneuvering is inevitable. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about its passage, as it is the correct course of action. It benefits America and the global community. This region boasts the most rapid growth globally, presenting a substantial market for us. While they enjoy relatively low tariffs when exporting to the U.S., our tariffs are comparatively higher. Eliminating 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods entering the world's largest and fastest-growing markets is advantageous for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade agreements have exposed us to lower wages and substandard labor practices. TPP mandates enforceable commitments to elevate labor standards and tackle environmental issues. I have yet to encounter a compelling argument suggesting TPP will be detrimental. We are unequivocally better off. The political landscape will be turbulent, similar to the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian agreements, but we successfully concluded those. Concerning currency manipulation, TPP incorporates transparency provisions. Some advocated for enforceable measures, yet discerning manipulation proves challenging. Binding other nations on monetary policy would necessitate binding our Federal Reserve, which is unacceptable. However, we have bolstered provisions to monitor competitive devaluations.

However, I focus on the fundamentals of our economy, and I believe people will make rational decisions based on facts. Our job creation is strong, real after-tax wages are rising, and inflation is low. The global economy is also strong, boosting our exports and contributing to robust growth. We also need to consider the liquidity in the system, which I'm told is sufficient for markets to correct. We must show empathy for those who lose their homes. I'm not sure what you mean by 'bailout.' Direct grants to homeowners? No, I don't support that. But ensuring financial institutions like the FHA have the flexibility to help people refinance? Yes, I support that. We also need more transparency in financial documents and greater financial literacy. Many hardworking Americans signed up for loans without fully understanding them. Government should enhance financial education initiatives, and we're already doing that.", "label": "Deflection"}

We've had numerous discussions and established very important relationships at various levels. We even have people here from North Korea in the room. We went into this final agreement with a tremendous relationship and tremendous knowledge. That's why we got it done. Now, I'm going to head back. It's been a long time since I've taken it easy. So now we can relax a little, and then the work begins again. I appreciate everyone being here. I hope we've answered your questions. And congratulations to everyone, because this is a very important event in world history. I want to get it completed. So Mike, our whole team has to get to work and get it completed.

We discussed a wide range of issues, including economic cooperation and regional security.

We will continue to work with Malaysia to address these challenges. As for specific details, those conversations remain private.", "label": "Declining to answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, in his last major speech, Tony Blair said on Iraq: Hand on heart, I did what I thought was right. But if I got it wrong, I'm sorry. Is it possible you got it wrong? Would you share, at this point, those slightly more reflective sentiments? And in particular, should you, in retrospect, perhaps have concentrated a little more on Afghanistan?And could I ask the Prime Minister, is the Lisbon Treaty dead in the water now? And if so, what happens next for Europe? [SEP] History will judge the tactics. History will judge whether or not, you know, more troops were needed earlier, troops could have been positioned here better or not. Removing Saddam Hussein was not wrong. It was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do for our security, right thing to do for peace, and the right thing to do for 25 million Iraqis.And now the fundamental question is, will we have the willpower and the patience to help the Iraqis develop a democracy in the heart of the Middle East? It's a democracy that's not going to look like America. It's not going to look like Great Britain. But it's a democracy that will have government responsive to the people. People say: Was that worth it? Is it necessary? Absolutely, it's necessary, if you believe we're in an ideological war being—the theaters of which right now—the most notable theaters are Afghanistan and Iraq.The strategic implications of a free Iraq are significant for our future. For example, a free Iraq will make it easier to deal with the Iranian issue. A free Iraq will send a clear signal to reformers and dissidents, would-be journalists throughout the Middle East that a free society is available for you as well. And the question facing the Western World is, will we fall prey to the argument that stability is more important than forms of government, that what appears to be stable and peaceful—is that more important than how people live their lives, what kind of government? You just heard the Prime Minister speak eloquently about Zimbabwe. The lesson there is, forms of government matter.Freedom has had a transformative effect in Europe, in the Far East. And the fundamental question is, will we work to see it have a transformative effect in the Middle East? Now, there are many doubters. I understand that, because there is some who say that perhaps freedom is not universal. Maybe it's only Western people that can self-govern. Maybe it's only, you know, white-guy Methodists who are capable of self-government. I reject that notion. I think that's the ultimate form of political elitism, and I believe an accurate reading of history says that freedom can bring peace we want. And it'll bring peace to the Middle East, unless of course we become isolationist, unless of course we lose our confidence, unless of course we quit.And so yes, I'm sure there's—people will say, they could have done things better here and there. But I'm absolutely confident that the decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision. And can I just emphasize: The passion for freedom, I think, is a universal value, and I believe that Iraq is a democracy today because of the action that we have taken. And our next task is to make sure that all Iraqis feel that they have an economic stake as well as a democratic stake in the future of the country. And that's why the work continues.On Europe, I'll meet Brian Cowen, the of Ireland, when I'm in Belfast later today. The legal position on the European treaty is very clear, that all 27 members must sign and, therefore, ratify the treaty before it comes into force. It is for each member to decide its own process for doing so. And we will continue our process of debating this in the House of Lords and then royal assent during the course of this week.I think a short period of reflection is necessary for the Irish to put forward their proposals about how they will deal with this, and we look forward to the Irish coming to the European Council on Thursday with a view of what should be done. I believe that when David Miliband makes a statement to the House this afternoon following a meeting of the European foreign ministers, he will be able to say that all the European Union members believe that Ireland should be given this time to reflect on what they need to do and then make their proposals about how the situation can be resolved.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. And if I may, on one other business topic, how would you assess the likelihood of the actions taken on steel today of making a difference in overcapacity? [SEP] Good. No, those are both great questions. This issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion is something that we have actively promoted as an issue for the G-20 to tackle. We've worked with not only the G-20 countries, but also some of the multilateral organizations, like the OECD, to refine how we can approach these problems. It's a complicated piece of business.We did not bring up the specific case of Apple, because as a general rule, I don't want to bring up a single case in a forum like this, where we're trying to shape broader policy. But at home, we have been focused—whether it's on the inversion rules that we put forward, the proposals that we put forward to define who the beneficiaries are behind the veil so that we can catch people who are avoiding their taxes—we're doing a bunch of stuff at home, and we want to coordinate better norms internationally. The one thing that we have to make sure we do is to move in concert with other countries, because there's always a danger that if one of us acts unilaterally, that it's not just a matter of a U.S. company being impacted, but it may also have an effect in terms of our ability to collect taxes from that same company. And so you might end up with a situation where they pay into Europe, and U.S.—the U.S. Treasury is shortchanged. So if there is not some coordination between various tax authorities, you get a problem there.In the same way that we think there has to be some coordination about even some of our closest allies racing to the bottom in terms of how they enforce their tax policies in ways that lead to revenue shifting and tax avoidance in our country.So this is not something that I think is going to be sorted out overnight. I do think that if we are to regain the trust of ordinary people that the system is not rigged and deal with these trends of inequality that have risen out of globalization and technological change, that we've got to make sure we tackle this issue in an effective way.And we've made some progress, but not as much as we need to. And my hope is, is that it's recognized that it's in the interest of all countries, whether they're developed countries or developing countries, to work together to put a stop to this. Because developed countries are losing revenue, and that erodes their tax base and their ability to educate kids and build universities and build infrastructure, but it also wallops developing countries because oftentimes, tax avoidance can go hand in hand with corrupt practices that impede development.In terms of excess capacity, this is an issue that we wanted to get on the agenda. We got it on the agenda. In my bilateral conversations with President Xi, there was an agreement that we would make progress on dealing with steel overcapacity, which, by the way, is consistent with the plans that President Xi himself has had to reorient the economy so that it's not so heavily dependent on state-owned enterprises and an export model.So we've made some progress—not as much as we'd like to see—but some progress on that front bilaterally. Multilaterally, the way this was resolved was, the G-20 agreed to put together an intensive process of gathering all the data, determining what the best steps are, which will then be reported in the G-20 in Hamburg next year. And I think there was a validation of the basic principle that, to the extent that overcapacity is the result not just of market forces, but specific policy decisions that are distorting a well-functioning market, that that needs to be fixed.And so it was one of a number of examples that aren't always sexy and don't attract a lot of headlines of where issues that we've raised in the G-20 get adopted, and then a bunch of work gets done, and the following year, you start seeing action, and slowly, we strengthen and build up international norms.If you look at the issue of IT and the digital economy, we were able to get the G-20 to adopt a range of principles about an open Internet, net neutrality, making sure that businesses and vendors and providers aren't discriminated across borders, reflecting a lot of the foundational principles that have led to this digital revolution over the last several years.And that will, in turn, generate a bunch of new work. And there will still be conflicts about how people deal with censorship or how they deal with cybersecurity issues, but we chip away at it, and over time, what you get is sturdier international norms that everybody abides to and will help all countries grow and help people prosper. So I'm—my parting words at the G-20 were, having watched this process over the last 8 years, I think we all have to recognize, these are turbulent times. A lot of countries are seeing volatile politics. Sometimes, you read the headlines, and you can get discouraged about whether the international community and leadership are able to shape solutions fast enough for the scale of the problems, whether it's migrants and refugees or climate change or terrorism or making sure the international economy is working for everybody. But then, when you look back over the course of 8 years, actually, you find out, things have gotten better, not always as fast as we'd like, but in significant ways.You look at the progress we've made on the financial system. The American banking system now has $700 billion more in capital; it is much safer and much sturdier. But it's not just us. Because of the G-20, you also have a Basel III agreement in which all countries are having to strengthen their capital requirements and put in place some basic safeguards to prevent what happened at Lehmans. And that's true across the board.So, as always, I'd always like to see even more get done, but I'm cautiously optimistic about the progress that we made. I tell my staff when they feel worn out sometimes that better is always good. It may not be everything that needs to get done, but if it's better than before we started, we'll take it.

On Keystone, there's an independent process moving forward. I'll let it play out, considering if it's good for the American people, their pocketbooks, job creation, gas prices, and climate change. There's a pending case in Nebraska. While the Canadian oil debate rages, American oil and natural gas production have seen significant increases. We're closer to energy independence than ever before, importing less foreign oil. We have a hundred-year supply of natural gas.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, while you emphasize coordination on green economic policies, President Macron has labeled the Inflation Reduction Act as 'super-aggressive' towards European companies.

It's a monumental investment in addressing climate change, and inevitably, there will be some fine-tuning required. For example, the provision concerning free trade agreements was intended to encompass our allies, not just those with formal agreements. We are dedicated to finding mutually beneficial solutions. Our overarching objective is to ensure that both the U.S. and Europe possess robust and independent supply chains. We are willing to make necessary modifications to facilitate European participation. The intention was never to exclude those who are collaborating with us. The goal is to avoid dependence on other nations, as we witnessed during the pandemic when China restricted the supply of computer chips.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, on the North Korea deal, the former U.N. Ambassador, John Bolton, yesterday said, quote, It's a bad, disappointing deal, and the best thing you can say about it is that it will probably fall apart. This is from a man you repeatedly praised for his judgment and leadership at the United Nations. His main criticism is that the financial pressure led North Korea back to the table, and now it's being released. How do you respond to that? [SEP] I strongly disagree, strongly disagree with his assessment. I have told the American people, like the ian issue, I wanted to solve the North Korean issue peacefully, and that the President has an obligation to try all diplomatic means necessary to do so. I changed the dynamic on the North Korean issue by convincing other people to be at the table with us, on the theory that the best diplomacy is diplomacy in which there is more than one voice—that has got an equity in the issue— speaking.And so we had a breakthrough as a result of other voices than the United States saying to the North Koreans, We don't support your nuclear weapons program, and we urge you to get rid of it in a verifiable way. Perhaps the most significant voice that had been added to the table was China. But the South Korean voice was vital, as was the Japanese and Russian voices as well. So the assessment made by some that this is not a good deal is just flat wrong.Now, those who say the North Koreans have got to prove themselves by actually following through in the deal are right— and I'm one. This is a good first step. It will be a great deal for the North Korean people if their Government follows through with the agreement, which, by the way, started in September of 2005. The agreement that we announced the other day was a continuation of the initial agreement in September of 2005. And for those who say that, well, this is an interesting moment, and now it's up to the North Koreans to do that which they say they will do, I couldn't agree more with you.And the first phase is to shut down and seal their facility, their main weapons manufacturing facility, and then disclose their programs. And for that, they'll receive some help from the South Koreans, the equivalent of 50,000 tons of fuel.And the second phase is to disable and abandon their facilities. In other words, this is a phased approach that will enable all of us to say to our respective populations, we're watching carefully and that there's a opportunity for the North Koreans to prove that this program can work.If they do the second phase, there is a—there will be about the equivalent of a million tons—minus the 50,000 tons— available of food, economic assistance, and fuel. I am particularly interested in helping get food to the North Korean people. Now, that's not going to happen until there's some verifiable measures that have been taken.The financial measures that you're speaking about are really a separate item, because it has everything to do with—it's a banking issue that our Treasury Department is analyzing to determine whether or not funds were illicitly moved through the bank.Let's see, yes, sir.", "label": "Explicit"}

[SEP] Mark, let me just add to what the Prime Minister said. He'll be able to shoot those missiles down once he finishes buying all that extra military stuff from the United States. He'll knock 'em right out of the sky, just like we did in Saudi Arabia the other day. It was like hitting a needle in the sky, and boom, gone, no damage. So, one of the big things is, the Prime Minister's gonna be buying tons of military equipment, which he should. And we make the best, by far. He's buying it from us, whether it's the F-35, which is the best fighter in the world, totally stealth, or all kinds of missiles. That's jobs for us, and it's safety for Japan and other countries buying our stuff, which they weren't doing much of a year or two ago. Now, about China, my relationship with President Xi is great. I like him a lot, consider him a friend. He's a friend to me too. But he's China, and I'm the U.S. We see things differently, but we're pretty much on the same page with trade. The problem with China is, for years, they've been getting away with murder, trade-wise, under past administrations. The deficit's huge, like $350 billion to $504 billion a year, not even counting the intellectual property theft. We've started talking to China about fixing this, making it free, fair, or reciprocal. I like reciprocal best. People get it. We charge them what they charge us. Some of these countries, they slap a hundred-percent tax on our stuff, and we charge them nothing. I've been saying this for years, and we're gonna do something about it. It takes time, gotta follow the rules, give notices, wait the time. But we're catching up. You're gonna see some strong action against countries that have been treating the U.S., our workers, and our companies unfairly. I see these companies as part of our workforce. It's started already, the legal stuff's mostly done. Big changes are coming, and soon. The U.S. has been getting a raw deal on trade for too long. Thank you.

F-35A, SM-3 Block IIA, those are examples. Aegis ships, gotta make 'em better. We'll be buying more from the U.S. That's the plan. North Korea launched missiles.

{"sentence": "Q. Well, indulge all of us back in the U.S., sir. Prince passed away. You were a fan. You had invited him to perform at the White House. Can you tell us what made you a fan? [SEP] I'm trying to figure out which order to do this. [] Maybe I'll start with North Carolina and Mississippi. I want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people of North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people. They are hospitable people. They are beautiful States, and you are welcome and you should come and enjoy yourselves. And I think you'll be treated with extraordinary hospitality.I also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned. And they're in response to politics, in part; in part, some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people, but I just disagree with when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, whether they're transgender or gay or lesbian. And although I respect their different viewpoints, I think it's very important for us not to send signals that anybody is treated differently.And I think it's fair to say that we're not unique among countries where—particularly under a federal system in which power is dispersed, that there are going to be some localities or local officials that put forward laws that aren't necessarily reflective of a national consensus. But if you guys come to North Carolina or Mississippi, everybody will be treated well.The second question with respect to Syria, I am deeply concerned about the cessation of hostilities fraying and whether it's sustainable. Now, keep in mind that I have always been skeptical about Mr. Putin's actions and motives inside of Syria. He is—along with Iran—the preeminent backer of a murderous regime that I do not believe can regain legitimacy within his country because he's murdered a lot of people.Having said that, what I also believe is, is that we cannot end the crisis in Syria without political negotiations and without getting all the parties around the table to craft a transition plan. And that, by necessity, means that there are going to be some people on one side of the table who I deeply disagree with and whose actions I deeply abhor. That's how oftentimes you resolve conflicts like this that are taking an enormous toll on the Syrian people.The cessation of hostilities actually held longer than I expected. And for 7 weeks, we've seen a significant reduction in violence inside that country. And that gave some relief to people.I talked to Putin on Monday precisely to reinforce to him the importance of us trying to maintain the cessation of hostilities, asking him to put more pressure on Asad, indicating to him that we would continue to try to get the moderate opposition to stay at the negotiating table in Geneva. But this has always been hard. And it's going to keep being hard. And what David and I discussed in our meeting was that we will continue to prosecute the war against Daesh, against ISIL. We are going to continue to support those who are prepared to fight ISIL. And we're going to continue to target them. We're going to continue to make progress. But we're not going to solve the overall problem unless we can get this political track moving.I assure you that we have looked at all options. None of them are great. And so we are going to play this option out. If in fact the cessation falls apart, we'll try to put it back together again even as we continue to go after ISIL. And it is in my belief—it's my belief that ultimately Russia will recognize that, just as this can't be solved by a military victory on the part of those we support, Russia may be able to keep the lid on, alongside Iran, for a while, but if you don't have a legitimate Government there, they will be bled as well. And that is not—that's not speculation on my part. I think the evidence all points in that direction.And finally, with respect to Prince, I loved Prince because he put out great music and he was a great performer. I didn't know him well. He came to perform at the White House last year and was extraordinary and creative and original and full of energy. And so it's a remarkable loss.And I'm staying at Winfield House, the U.S. Ambassador's residence. It so happens our Ambassador has a turntable, and so this morning we played Purple Rain and Delirious just to get warmed up—[]—before we left the house for important bilateral meetings like this. []. As a fan of great music, the Ambassador has brought a lot of brilliant talent. . Absolutely.. Let me just answer: I've been to North Carolina many years ago and enjoyed it. I have not yet made it to Mississippi, but one day I hope to. The guidance that we put out, the Foreign Office, gives advice on travel, and it obviously deals with laws in situations as they are, and it tries to give that advice dispassionately, impartially. But it's very important that it does so. And it's something that a lot of attention is given to.Our view on any of these things is that we believe that we should be trying to use law to end discrimination rather than to embed it or enhance it. And that's something we're comfortable saying to countries and friends anywhere in the world. But obviously, the laws people pass is a matter for their own legislatures.

The Pope's actions are significant, and we're carefully evaluating their potential impact. Our goal is to foster a climate conducive to peace, where Israelis and Palestinians can live side-by-side in security and prosperity. That requires a comprehensive approach, addressing not only political issues but also economic and social factors. We're committed to working with all parties to achieve a just and lasting solution. It's a complex challenge, but we're determined to make progress. And, of course, we'll continue to pursue trade deals that benefit American workers and strengthen our economy.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with the CR expiring on December 11th, and considering the funding implications for Iraq, Syria, Ebola, and basic government operations, what are the odds of a government shutdown? How much does this possibility weigh on your immigration decisions? [SEP] I trust Senator McConnell's statement that the government won't shut down. There's no reason for it. We've been down that road before, it hurt the country, and it always ends the same way. It's unproductive, and I believe Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner understand that. More generally, democracy means disagreement. Our system allows a Congress and President from different parties with different views. The key is how we handle it. The sensible approach is to fight for our positions on disagreements, then work together where we agree. That's how it was with Reagan and the Democratic Congress. They didn't let disagreements stop them from working together. I expect the same here. Some Republicans disagree with me on immigration reform, and that's their right. But shutting down the government over it makes no sense, like me shutting it down every time they try to repeal healthcare. Let's focus on the people's business.", "label": "Deflection"}

I can't just conjure up a massive infrastructure bill, as much as I'd like to. But where I *do* have authority, I'm going to use it to help the American people.

Are you prepared to utilize any and all means at the disposal of the United States government to ensure his departure? If not, what's holding us back, especially given our seemingly more involved position compared to other similar situations? [SEP] Look, our first act was to get our people, the Americans and the Embassy staff, outta Libya safe and sound, and we did that. Right after, we slapped the biggest financial freeze on assets this country's ever seen. Then came the sanctions, and we got the whole world on board through the UN, slowly but surely turning the screws on Qadhafi. He's getting more and more cut off from everyone, with sanctions and no more weapons coming in. We're also sending aid to folks crossing into Tunisia and Egypt, making sure they're okay, and we'll keep doing that. We're talking with NATO about all sorts of moves, from watching the ground 24/7 so we can jump in if things get worse, to tightening the arms ban, sending more help, and even thinking about military options like a no-fly zone. NATO's meeting Tuesday to talk about that no-fly zone, and we've been chatting with Arab and African countries to see if they're with us on that. Hillary's meeting with the opposition soon, and we're sending someone over there to talk to them and see how we can help even more. So, bottom line, nothing's off the table. Gotta understand, we moved faster than anyone ever has to put the squeeze on Qadhafi. I'm crystal clear that it's in America's interest, and especially the Libyan people's, for Qadhafi to go. And I ain't ruling anything out. But I take it real serious when we're talking about using our military. Gotta think it through with Gates, Mullen, and everyone else.

[SEP] Seattle, after all they've been through, with the embarrassment of Antifa and the radical left taking over a large part of the city, a major city, that they allowed that to happen is unbelievable. That it took so long to fix is unbelievable. And they only acted because they knew we were going in the next day, and they didn't want to be embarrassed. The people just gave up, they were exhausted from having their city taken over for so long. The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount from the police department, really, to the point where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job. So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are. They've done a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly.

The most difficult part of this job is signing those letters to the families of our fallen heroes. Regarding the media coverage policy, we are currently reviewing it in consultation with the Department of Defense. I prefer to withhold my answer until I have fully assessed the review's implications. Afghanistan presents a significant challenge. Unlike Iraq, where we've seen a relatively peaceful election, Afghanistan's government appears disconnected. The Taliban and Al Qaeda are active in the border regions. We need a coordinated effort to eliminate those safe havens.

It's a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we're going to do fantastically well.I view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. It could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think. And next year, you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before, and maybe even better, because there is that pent-up demand that is—you know, a lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they've had to hold back because of the virus.So I think you're going to have, with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes—doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes. Like a certain party, namely the Democrats want to do. You'll mess it all up.You know, we had the greatest in the world. I presided—this administration presided—over it. It got great for a reason.

Did you assure the President that you would sever ties with Al Sadr, and could your government even remain standing after such a move? [SEP] I'm going to allow the Prime Minister to speak for himself regarding his relationship with Al Sadr. We spent a significant amount of time discussing the security situation in Iraq. I voiced my concerns, and he echoed those concerns. After all, providing security for the Iraqi people is one of his most important responsibilities. Part of the Prime Minister's frustration is that he lacks the necessary tools to deal with those who break the law. I was reassured by his commitment to a pluralistic society that is politically united, and a society in which people are held accountable if they break the law, whether they be criminals, Al Qaeda, or militia. He discussed his political situation with me, and I think it's best that he speak to you directly about the Sadr group or any other group within Iraq. Our coalition is not with just one entity. The national unity Government is a government formed of all the entities that participated in it. Therefore, that coalition represents a national responsibility. Mr. Sadr and the Sadrists are just one component that participate in the Parliament or in the Government. Participating in the Government is a responsibility, and it's a mutual commitment, and those who participate in this Government need to bear responsibilities. Foremost among those responsibilities is the protection of this Government, the protection of the Constitution, and the protection of the law. Therefore, I do not talk about one side at the expense of the other. I'm talking about a state; I'm talking about law; I'm talking about commitments. And this should apply to all the partners in the Government who have chosen to participate in the political process.

[SEP] Well, first of all, let me say that I think that Kim Jong Un, or Chairman Kim, as some people say, is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. I think he's very much—I talk to him a lot about it, and he's very much into the fact that—he believes, like I do, that North Korea has tremendous economic potential like perhaps few other developing nations anywhere in the world.And I think that he is looking to develop that way. He knows that, with nuclear, that's never going to happen. Only bad can happen. He understands that. He is a very smart man. He gets it well.So I think that he is going to try, at some point. I'm in no rush at all. The sanctions remain. We have our hostages back. We, as you know, are getting the remains, continuing to get the remains. A lot of good things are happening.And, very importantly, there's been no nuclear testing for 2 years. I looked at a chart the other day. During the past administration, there were many numbers that were very high, like 10 and 12 and 18, having to do with missile launches and nuclear testing.

I'd like to actually start by following up on Jeff's question and then ask you about supply chains as a follow-up to that.But, on the question of oil prices, economists say that, you know, when you raise the price of something, people will consume less of it. So why not allow even middle class people around the world to pay more for gasoline in the hope that they would consume fewer fossil fuels and emit less? [SEP] Well, because they have to get to their work. They have to get in an automobile, turn on the key, get their kids to school. The school buses have to run. That's the reason why. You know that, Jim. That's the reason.The idea that we can—that there's an alternative to walk away from being able to get in your automobile is just not realistic; it's not going to happen. And this wasn't intended to happen.And by the way, when the cost of a gallon of gasoline gets to above three hundred and thirty—three hundred—$3.35 a gallon, it has profound impact on working class families just to get back and forth to work. So I don't see anything inconsistent with that.But I do think that the idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is—is not right.

It'll be interesting to see who represents Russia at the G-8, for example. That'll give us some insight into Russia's foreign policy after Putin's presidency. I can't answer that question yet. It's in our interest to maintain relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation, we need to ensure dangerous materials don't spread. We need to work together on Iran. I appreciated Putin's offer to provide enriched uranium to Iran for the Bushehr plant, negating their need to enrich it themselves. That was constructive. We need to be able to work with Russia on Iran. There are many areas where we need to cooperate. Yesterday, with the Czech Prime Minister, I discussed missile defense in Europe. It's in our interest to help Russia understand the system isn't aimed at them but at real 21st-century threats, like a launch from a violent regime with weapons of mass destruction. So, there are areas where we need to cooperate. I'm going to try to leave my successor with the ability to have a relationship with whoever is running foreign policy in Russia.

Do you think that North Korea will go along with verification of its nuclear programs? For people who think that this is just another go-around, why will this time be any different? [SEP] I've been meeting with Chinese leaders now for 71⁄2 years; my message has been the same: You should not fear religious people in your society; as a matter of fact, religious people will make your society a better place; that you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds.

I think I need to answer part of the question. As for the six-party talks and the prospects for the six-party talks, I think there are many skeptics as to the future of the six-party talks. I think many people around the world look at the behavior of up until today and they say—and they wonder whether will faithfully carry out verification.

[SEP] Well, let's put ourselves in Israel's shoes for a moment. If a neighboring leader openly threatened to wipe you off the map, and was pursuing nuclear weapons to do it, you'd be concerned too. That's why we all need to work together to stop Iran. There's a real urgency here, and you can hear it in the voices of Israeli politicians. I'm hopeful we can get this done. And, by the way, I believe we can reach a global climate change agreement during my presidency. It's the only real solution. Individual commitments from developed nations aren't enough, especially with rapidly developing countries like China. We need everyone at the table, with the most developed nations taking the lead. That's why these discussions are so important. As President Bush said, mandatory emission reduction targets for developed economies are key. How each economy reaches those targets is less important, but the goals must be set. This is how we address climate change. And we need to involve other countries too.

Avoiding self-inflicted crises will allow us to address critical issues such as preventing tragedies like Newtown and focusing on energy and immigration reform. By setting aside partisan divisions, we can work together for the betterment of the country. I believe the Speaker shares this desire. It is imperative to create an environment within both the House and Senate Republican caucuses that prioritizes the country's interests over political battles.", "label": "Implicit"}

I don't think Congress ought to be running the war; I think they ought to be funding our troops. I'm certainly interested in their opinion, but trying to run a war through resolution is a prescription for failure, as far as I'm concerned, and we can't afford to fail.I'll work with Congress; I'll listen to Congress. Congress has got all the right to appropriate money. But the idea of telling our military how to conduct operations, for example, or how to deal with troop strength is—I don't think it makes sense. I don't think it makes sense today, nor do I think it's a good precedent for the future. And so the role of the Commander in Chief is, of course, to consult with Congress.", "label": "Explicit"}

Are you saying at no point while the rhetoric was escalating, as world war III was making it into conversation, at no point nobody from your intelligence team or your administration was saying, maybe you want to back it down a little bit? [SEP] No, I've never—nobody ever told me that. Having said—having laid that out, I still feel strongly that is a danger. Nothing has changed in this NIE that says, okay, why don't we just stop worrying about it. Quite the contrary, I think the NIE makes it clear that needs to be taken seriously as a threat to peace. Their—my opinion hasn't changed.And I just explained, Jim [Jim Axelrod, CBS News], that if you want to avoid a really problematic situation in the Middle East, now is the time to continue to work together. That's our message to our allies, and it's an important message for them to hear. And here's the reason why: In order for a nation to develop a nuclear weapons program, they must have the materials from which to make a bomb, the know-how on how to take that material and make it explode, and a delivery system.Now, the ians—the most difficult aspect of developing a weapons program, or as some would say, the long pole in the tent, is enriching uranium. This is a na-tion— is a nation that is testing ballistic missiles. And it is a nation that is trying to enrich uranium. The NIE says this is a country that had a covert nuclear weapons program, which, by the way, they have failed to disclose, even today. They have never admitted the program existed in the first place.The danger is, is that they can enrich, play like they got a civilian program—or have a civilian program, or claim it's a civilian program—and pass the knowledge to a covert military program. And then the danger is, is at some point in the future, they show up with a weapon. And my comments are, now is the time to work together to prevent that scenario from taking place.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with all due respect, Republicans are saying that this election was primarily about government spending. They insist that they will never accept anything resembling a stimulus bill or any of your proposals to stimulate job growth through spending. Do you concede that any form of government spending to create jobs is now off the table? If so, what alternative measures can the government take to address the critical issue of job creation? [SEP] Well, I think that's going to be a question for everyone to answer. The American people are concerned about spending and debt. I'm going to have a bipartisan deficit commission that will come up with some ideas. Hopefully, they can agree on some programs we can cut. But we can't cut into the core investments that are going to make sure that we are a competitive economy. So the question is, what are our priorities? What do we care about? That's going to be a tough debate. I inherited a big deficit, and that has been made worse because of the recession. As we bring it down, I want to make sure that we're not cutting into education. I don't think we should be cutting back on research and development. I think the proposal that I put forward with respect to infrastructure is one that we've had bipartisan agreement about. It makes no sense for China to have better rail systems than us. They're making investments because they know those investments will pay off over the long term. So in these budget discussions, the key is to be able to distinguish between stuff that isn't adding to our growth and those things that are absolutely necessary for us to be able to increase job growth in the future as well. Now, the single most important thing I think we need to do economically is making sure that taxes don't go up on middle class families next year. And so we've got some work to do on that front. I think it makes sense for us to extend unemployment insurance because there are still a lot of folks out there hurting. So there are some things that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it, even as we're also sitting down and figuring out, okay, over the next several years what kinds of budget cuts can we make that are intelligent, that are smart, that won't be undermining our recovery, but, in fact, will be encouraging job growth.", "label": "Dodging"}

Default is not an option. It's a dangerous game that would have devastating consequences. Imagine the chaos if families decided to skip mortgage payments – the consequences would be catastrophic.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Given some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief, did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump Presidency? [SEP] Well, we had a very cordial conversation. And that didn't surprise me to some degree, because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He's somebody who, I think, likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.And what's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff.I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set, hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately, he's pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he's got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the Federal Government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it's an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes, even in our first 2 years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office.And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he's really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I'll use a obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act.So, obviously, this has been the holy grail for Republicans over the last 6, 7 yearswas, We've got to kill Obamacare. Now, that has been taken as an article of faith, that this is terrible, it doesn't work, and we have to undo it.But now that Republicans are in charge, they've got to take a look and say, let's see, we've got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the Federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefiting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of, everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms.Now, it's one thing to characterize thesethis thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge, and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off, and suddenly, they don't have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business, that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parent's health insurance plan until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues?Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first ones to say, that's great, congratulations.If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way.So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is, now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming administration a country that is stronger; a Federal Government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the challenges facing Africa, what key actions should the continent prioritize, what leadership qualities are essential, and how can the United States effectively support its transformation? Furthermore, what specific outcomes do you hope to achieve during this five-nation tour, and why have you chosen to visit Africa towards the end of your presidency? How will you ensure the sustainability of your initiatives? [SEP] Well, thank you. Actually, I made a point to visit Africa early in my presidency as well. This marks my second trip to the continent, and I'm here to underscore that it is in our best interest to assist African nations in addressing preventable diseases like malaria, as well as more complex challenges such as HIV/AIDS. It's also in our interest to foster trade between Africa and the United States, and to allocate resources towards education so that governments can educate their children. There's no better way to emphasize this point than by being in Ghana, where people can witness firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to deliver speeches in America, but it's quite another to come to Ghana and meet the individuals who are actively involved in making Ghana a better place. Secondly, Africa has undergone positive changes since I assumed the presidency. This is primarily due to the efforts of African leaders themselves – I want to emphasize that. When I took office, there were six regional conflicts. Consider Liberia, for instance. It presented a significant challenge, and with the collaboration of Nigeria and the advice of individuals like John, we made decisions, along with other leaders, that facilitated the installation of the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. I'll be visiting there tomorrow to celebrate her accomplishments and reaffirm our commitment to providing support. In other words, conflict resolution has been underway. And the United States has refrained from imposing its will. Instead, we've strived to be a valuable partner, as exemplified by our work in eastern Congo, where we collaborated with the Presidents of Rwanda, Congo, and Burundi. Secondly, democracy is advancing across the African continent. One reason for this progress is the presence of role models like John Kufuor, whom people look up to and respect. And thirdly, our aid program has evolved from simply providing funds with no strings attached to one that expects certain behaviors in return for our generosity, such as combating corruption and investing in the education of children. I don't believe that's an unreasonable expectation in exchange for U.S. taxpayers' money. This approach is novel, but I'm confident in asking nations to adhere to sound principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders. I have confidence in the capabilities of the leaders I've met—not every single leader—but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy—a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent. And that's why I'm here, and I'm glad I am. It's been a great trip, and it's—and I appreciate the hospitality of my friend, and so does Laura. Let's see here, John McKinnon.

Chancellor Merkel, Assad calls Trump a natural ally, while your Foreign Minister calls him a preacher of hate. Do Americans have a perception problem? [SEP] Well, one of the great things about our democracy is that it expresses itself in many ways, including protests. I've been protested during my eight years, and I think every president has been. So, I wouldn't tell people who feel strongly about the issues raised during the campaign to be silent. What I would advise, and have advised, is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matters. I consistently tell young people, in the U.S. and here in Germany, don't take our systems of government and way of life for granted. Because we've lived in a largely stable and peaceful era, with rising living standards, there's a tendency to assume it will always be this way. But it's not. Democracy is hard work. In the U.S., if 43 percent of eligible voters don't vote, democracy is weakened. If we're not serious about facts, especially in an age of social media where people get information in soundbites, if we can't distinguish between serious arguments and propaganda, we have problems. If people, conservative or liberal, are unwilling to compromise and demonize opponents, democracy will break down. So, my advice is to understand the foundations of a healthy democracy and how to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us or during an election. It's hard work. The good news is, many young people involved in my campaigns continue to be involved in work, politically and through nonprofits, that can carry this hard work forward. But sometimes there's complacency. Here in Europe, many young people forget the Cold War and what it meant to have a wall. And I'll be honest, I've heard rhetoric in Europe that equates the U.S. and Russia, and how our governments operate versus other governments, and those distinctions aren't made. I've said many times that, like any government, we have flaws, we've operated imperfectly, we've made mistakes. There are times when I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned with our values. It's a work of constant improvement. But I can say to the German people that the U.S. has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And across Europe, many principles taken for granted here around free speech, civil liberties, an independent judiciary, and fighting corruption are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we've tried to apply not just in our own country, but also in our foreign policy. That should be remembered. Because in an age of active misinformation, packaged well and looking the same on Facebook or TV, where overzealousness by a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems the same and no distinctions are made, we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of democratic freedoms, market-based economies, and prosperity that we've come to take for granted. That was a long answer, wasn't it? I don't remember if there was a second part to it. I got all caught up in that one.", "label": "Implicit"}

And among them, the visit to the United States by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in May this year and the state visit to Vietnam of Honorable President Donald Trump in the very first year of his term of office are the highlights.Meetings between leaders of Vietnam and the President during his visit are very useful, and the meetings give us the opportunity to understand each other better and to work together on areas of mutual interests.

[SEP] Well, it's certainly a challenging situation there, no doubt about it. We had a robust discussion about it, a very strong discussion, I would say. Of course, the primary focus was denuclearization, but we dedicated a significant amount of time to the human rights issue. We're going to be working on it.

It was definitely a key topic, separate from the nuclear issue.", "label": "Dodging"}
{"sentence": "Q. Is the individual mandate one of those lines you can't cross? [SEP] Yes, the individual mandate is a line I can't cross because the concept, borrowed from Massachusetts, from a law instituted by a former opponent of mine, Mitt Romney, understood that if you're providing health insurance to people through the private marketplace, then you've got to make sure that people can't game the system and just wait until they get sick before they go try to buy health insurance. You can't ensure that people with preexisting conditions can get health insurance unless you also say, while you're healthy, before you need it, you've got to get health insurance.And obviously, there are hardship exemptions. We understand that there are some folks who, even with the generous subsidies that have been provided, still can't afford it. But that's a central component of the law.In terms of enrollment, we'll do some additional announcements about that in the days to come. Starting in the middle of this month, people can sign up again. I think there are a number of people who the first time around sat on the sidelines in part because of our screw-ups on healthcare.gov. That's one area, Ed, by the way, that's very particular. We're really making sure the website works super well before the next open enrollment period. [] We're double- and triple-checking it. And so I think a lot of people who maybe initially thought, we're not sure how this works, let's wait and see—they're going to have an opportunity now to sign up. And what's been terrific is to see how more private insurers have come into the marketplace so that there's greater competition in more markets all around the country. The premiums that have come in that are available to people and the choices that are available are better than a lot of people, I think, had predicted.So the law is working. That doesn't mean it can't be improved.Major Garrett. [CBS News]", "label": "Explicit"}

[SEP] We're looking at two different things here. First, there's the JCPOA, and whether we can get back to it. That depends on their actions and whether our friends are willing to stick with us and make sure there's an economic price to pay if they don't come back.

{"sentence": "President Obama, with the TPP seemingly stalled in Congress and other countries awaiting U.S. action, are you rethinking your strategy for its approval, especially given the recent Boeing and GE announcements? Should the agreement be revised to address currency manipulation concerns? Also, your thoughts on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and Pakistan's concerns about the strike on their soil? Does this signal a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you worried about a more hardline leader taking over? [SEP] Well, on TPP, I’ve been around long enough to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal. And especially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it. Having said that, I remain confident we're going to get it done. And the reason I'm confident is because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for America. It's good for the region. It's good for the world. And I know I've sold this to you before, but let me reiterate: This is the fastest growing part of the world. This represents an enormous market for the United States. Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs. In other words, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States. In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest growing markets of the world, that's a good deal for American businesses and American workers. Number two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulations. Well, if you're signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice, to attend to environmental problems. And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts, the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries. So I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we're going to be worse off. We are demonstrably better off. American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed. And I'm confident we will get it passed. Now, the politics of it will be noisy. That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korean free trade agreement or the Colombian and Panamanian free trade agreements when I came into office. But we got them done. And I'm confident that we'll get them done this time, as well, although it will—there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way. With respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place. One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that's not something that we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way. But we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it has been confirmed that he is dead. And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there. So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them. On the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander in Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we're going to protect our people. And that's exactly the message that has been sent.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

We'll still have disagreements with Cuba, including their government's treatment of its people and regional issues. But we can find areas of cooperation. Cuban doctors provided assistance during Ebola; their work in Haiti after the earthquake was valuable. I told President Castro we'll voice our opinions, but persuasion is paramount, particularly on issues that don't directly endanger our national security. Cuba isn't a threat. My concerns are ISIL, Iran's nuclear ambitions, Yemen, Libya, Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine, climate change – a substantial list.

[SEP] Allow me to also respond to the question directed at President Dilma. We consider Brazil not just a regional power, but a global one. Consider the G-20, a leading economic forum – Brazil is a major voice. The Paris climate negotiations depend on Brazil's leadership. Their renewable energy goals are indicative of this. Brazil is a major global player. I conveyed to President Dilma that the U.S., despite its strength, cannot address global challenges alone. Global health requires Brazil's partnership to prevent pandemics. Climate change, terrorism, poverty – all necessitate Brazil's involvement. They are an indispensable partner.I have a strong relationship with President Dilma. I trust her completely. She's always been forthcoming about Brazil's interests. She delivers on her promises. The defense cooperation agreements we discussed in Panama? She secured them through Congress – a significant achievement. This demonstrates her reliability.This meeting builds upon growing cooperation. Differences will inevitably arise, but that is true of all close friends and allies. We share common values, strong people-to-people connections, and similar histories. We should be strong partners for years to come.A portion of my answer was already articulated by [Obama], and I thank him for that. Countries experience crises. This should not diminish their role. A great country overcomes difficulties. This applies to nations, individuals, and all aspects of life: the bravery to overcome challenges and maintain commitment to one's people and country.It also applies to relations with countries like the U.S. Brazil and the U.S. share much in common. We both fought to overcome slavery. We have large Black populations and multicultural societies. These are valuable assets.We are also strong democracies. I congratulated [Obama] for overcoming the 2008 crisis. Brazil will overcome its current crisis. We will do so decisively, with a strong sense of commitment.We will not only resume growth but also safeguard the progress we have made in the past 12 years.

Kyoto might suit other nations, but it didn't for the U.S. The Senate voted 95-0 against it. We've pursued energy efficiency standards based on new technologies. We reduced greenhouse gases while our economy grew. We aim to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through the 20-in-10 program. New technologies are emerging, and Kyoto didn't facilitate that. Many countries aren't meeting Kyoto targets. We rejected it to grow our economy, reduce oil dependence, and be good stewards of the environment. I supported John's focus on climate change at APEC.

We're considering different individuals for different roles, which is typical after midterms. I didn't want to make any changes before the election. But overall, I'm very pleased with my Cabinet.

And if it doesn't happen—I'm not going in with high expectations, but we may come out with some very surprising things.But relationship is very important.

Those people were getting up, and in the end, Well, we are committing and we're—you know, they can't go—it's not like they can go immediately back. They have to go through their parliaments and their congresses and their representatives and whoever, whatever form they have.

And I think the number is actually much higher than that. But $34 billion more, at least. And again, that's nothing that my opponent would have done. My opponent would have—it would have just kept going down. You know, it was going down. You see what was happening over the years. The numbers were going down.

{"sentence": "Given the internal divisions within the House Republican Caucus, how confident are you that Speaker Boehner can secure the necessary votes for a comprehensive agreement, and do you still trust his leadership in this process? [SEP] The Speaker certainly faces challenges within his caucus, and I acknowledge that. Many of his members represent districts that I did not win. As a result, they may not see an incentive to cooperate with me, fearing challenges from within their own party. I understand this dynamic. However, recent events should provide a sense of perspective. We must prioritize the needs of the country. While disagreements may persist on various issues, compromise is essential to achieve deficit reduction, protect middle-class taxes, and foster economic growth. Avoiding self-inflicted crises will allow us to address critical issues such as preventing tragedies like Newtown and focusing on energy and immigration reform. By setting aside partisan divisions, we can work together for the betterment of the country. I believe the Speaker shares this desire. It is imperative to create an environment within both the House and Senate Republican caucuses that prioritizes the country's interests over political battles.", "label": "Implicit"}

It is essential to understand our history, including the complex and sometimes challenging relationship between the U.S. and Latin America. However, we must also avoid being constrained by our history. Chile has made significant progress in recent years, with the full support of the United States. I cannot comment on all past policies, but I can affirm our commitment to democracy, poverty reduction, and inclusive development.

And did Sony make the right decision in pulling the movie? Or does that set a dangerous precedent when faced with this kind of situation? [SEP] Well, let me address the second question first. Sony is a corporation. It suffered significant damage. There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced. Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.In this interconnected, digital world, there are going to be opportunities for hackers to engage in cyber assaults both in the private sector and the public sector. Now, our first order of business is making sure that we do everything to harden sites and prevent those kinds of attacks from taking place. When I came into office, I stood up a cybersecurity interagency team to look at everything that we could do at the Government level to prevent these kinds of attacks. We've been coordinating with the private sector, but a lot more needs to be done. We're not even close to where we need to be.And one of the things in the new year that I hope Congress is prepared to work with us on is strong cybersecurity laws that allow for information sharing across private sector platforms, as well as the public sector, so that we are incorporating best practices and preventing these attacks from happening in the first place.But even as we get better, the hackers are going to get better too. Some of them are going to be state actors; some of them are going to be nonstate actors. All of them are going to be sophisticated, and many of them can do some damage.We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States. Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like. Or even worse, imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended.So that's not who we are. That's not what America is about.Again, I'm sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities and this and that and the other. I wish they had spoken to me first. I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks. Imagine if, instead of it being a cyber threat, somebody had broken into their offices and destroyed a bunch of computers and stolen disks and—is that what it takes for suddenly you to pull the plug on something?And so we'll engage with not just the film industry, but the news industry and the private sector around these issues. We already have. We will continue to do so. But I think all of us have to anticipate occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They're going to be costly. They're going to be serious. We take them with the utmost seriousness. But we can't start changing our patterns of behavior any more than we stop going to a football game because there might be the possibility of a terrorist attack, any more than Boston didn't run its marathon this year because of the possibility that somebody might try to cause harm.

Part of what I want to do is to essentially get the American people in a safe place so that we can then get the economy in a stable place. And then we're going to have to have a broad-based discussion across the country about our priorities. And I started doing that yesterday down in North Carolina.Here's going to be the long-term issue. We've had 2 years of emergency: emergency economic action on the banking industry, the auto industry, on unemployment insurance, on a whole range of issues--on State budgets. The situation has now stabilized, although for those folks who are out of work, it's still an emergency. So we've still got to focus short term on job growth.But we've got to have a larger debate about how is this country going to win the economic competition of the 21st century? How are we going to make sure that we've got the best trained workers in the world? There was just a study that came out today showing how we've slipped even further when it comes to math education and science education.So what are we doing to revamp our schools to make sure our kids can compete? What are we doing in terms of research and development to make sure that innovation is still taking place here in the United States of America? What are we doing about our infrastructure so that we have the best airports and the best roads and the best bridges? And how are we going to pay for all that at a time when we've got both short-term deficit problems, medium-term deficit problems, and long-term deficit problems?Now, that's going to be a big debate. And it's going to involve us sorting out what Government functions are adding to our competitiveness and increasing opportunity and making sure that we're growing the economy, and which aspects of the Government aren't helping.And then, we've got to figure out how do we pay for that. And that's going to mean looking at the Tax Code and saying, what's fair, what's efficient. And I don't think anybody thinks the Tax Code right now is fair or efficient. But we've got to make sure that we don't just paper over those problems by borrowing from China or Saudi Arabia. And so that's going to be a major conversation.And in that context, I don't see how the Republicans win that argument. I don't know how they're going to be able to argue that extending permanently these high-end tax cuts is going to be good for our economy when, to offset them, we'd end up having to cut vital services for our kids, for our veterans, for our seniors.But I'm happy to listen to their arguments.

Also, did President Vazquez ask you to mediate the mill dispute between Uruguay and Argentina? [SEP] We talked at length about Uruguay's worries regarding market access for certain products. The President brought up various trade issues, mentioning the quotas on things like cows and sheep, which he felt were unjust. I assured him I'd seriously consider his requests. You might think I was kidding about blueberries, but Uruguay makes some great ones, and it boils down to whether those growers can sell them here. So, we covered a lot of produce. I told the President, you gotta put problems on the table to fix 'em, and we'll help where we can, and explain why if we can't. Now, about protectionism, I'm worried about it, not just here but everywhere. I think free and fair trade makes the world better at fighting poverty. That's why I'm all in on finishing the Doha round of the WTO. I told the President about our plans to push that forward, based on talks with President Lula. I didn't spill any secrets, of course. The U.S. is ready to cut farm subsidies, as I said to the President, if we get market access. That's what I told President Lula, the Europeans, and now the President here.

Israel, as a sovereign nation, must decide how best to protect its security. The sanctions are significantly impacting Iran, affecting their oil sector and central bank. Their willingness to negotiate presents an opportunity for a peaceful resolution. The idea that we face an imminent decision is inaccurate. We've made an unparalleled commitment to Israel's security. True friends offer candid advice, and this matter extends beyond Israeli interests; it directly impacts U.S. interests. Military intervention always carries a cost, demanding careful consideration.

Let me just add to what the Prime Minister said. He'll be shooting those missiles down in no time once he finishes buying all that great military equipment from us. Just like we did in Saudi Arabia, a needle in the sky, hit immediately, no damage. The Prime Minister is buying massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. The best in the world, made right here in the USA. F-35s, missiles, you name it. Jobs for us, safety for Japan. As for China, my relationship with President Xi is excellent. I like him, consider him a friend. He represents China, I represent the United States. Different views, but similar on trade. The problem with China is decades of unfair trade. A massive trade deficit, hundreds of billions a year, not even counting intellectual property. We're already talking to China about this. It has to come down. We need free, fair, or reciprocal trade. I like reciprocal best. It's easy to understand. We charge the same as they charge us. It's fair. We have countries charging us 100% taxes, and we charge them nothing. That's been wrong for a long time, and we're going to fix it. It takes time, statutory limitations, notices, waiting periods. But we're catching up. You'll see strong action against countries treating the U.S. unfairly. It's already started, and the legal foundation is in place. It's going to happen soon. The U.S. has been treated very unfairly on trade. Thank you. Regarding Japan defense equipment, a lot of them we purchase from the United States. North Korean situation becoming very tough, the Asia-Pacific security situation becoming very tough, we qualitatively and quantitatively, we have to enhance our defense capability. As the President mentioned, F-35A is a case in point. SM-3 Block IIA is another plan for purchase from the United States. Aegis vessels, the quality and the quantity must be enhanced. In that process, we will be buying more from the United States. That is what I am thinking. Now, North Korea: North Korea launched missiles. Immediately after that, we traced them; we were able to grasp and trace where they were going. Missile defense is something which is based upon the cooperation between Japan and the United States. Missile defense system is a cooperation between the two countries. For the intercepting and shooting down, if it is necessary, of course, we will do that—if it is necessary. But in doing so, U.S. and Japan will closely coordinate our actions. Thank you.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

We've been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up. I freed up the FDA. Dr. Hahn has done a great job. And they're ready to approve something when they come in.The other thing that's happening that's very different is—you look at a company like Pfizer, a great company—really, one of the great companies of the world. Johnson & Johnson. They're all great companies. They're doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody has ever seen anything like it. You know, they're out in third—they're in the third level of trial. And I think that you're going to see things that are amazing.When I made statements like that—that's an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we're producing. But only because of what I've done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We're lucky that we don't have to, because that was considered fast.If this were a—an administration from the past—and I think I can say far beyond Obama, if—it was other administrations also—you wouldn't have a vaccine for 2½, 3 years.

Did you get any specific commitments from Russia or China on tightening sanctions? Did you move them at all?

[SEP] One of the striking things over the last 3 years since I came into office is the degree of unity that we've been able to forge in the international community with respect to . When I came into office, the world was divided and was unified around its nuclear program. We now have a situation where the world is united and is isolated. And because of our diplomacy and our efforts, we have, by far, the strongest sanctions on that we've ever seen. And and Russia were critical to making that happen. Had they not been willing to support those efforts in the United Nations, we would not be able to see the kind of progress that we've made.And they're having an impact. All our intelligence indicates that 's economy is suffering as a consequence of this. And we're also seeing that 's influence in the region has ebbed, in part because their approach to repression inside of is contrary to the Arab Spring that has been sweeping the Middle East.So we are in a much stronger position now than we were 2 or 3 years ago with respect to . Having said that, the recent IAEA report indicates what we already knew, which is, although does not possess a nuclear weapon and is technically still allowing IAEA observers into their country, that they are engaging in a series of practices that are contrary to their international obligations and their IAEA obligations. And that's what the IAEA report indicated.So what I did was to speak with President Medvedev, as well as President Hu, and all three of us entirely agree on the objective, which is making sure that does not weaponize nuclear power and that we don't trigger a nuclear arms race in the region. That's in the interests of all of us.In terms of how we move forward, we will be consulting with them carefully over the next several weeks to look at what other options we have available to us. The sanctions have enormous bite and enormous scope, and we're building off the platform that has already been established. The question is, are there additional measures that we can take. And we're going to explore every avenue to see if we can solve this issue diplomatically.I have said repeatedly, and I will say today, we are not taking any options off the table, because it's my firm belief that an with a nuclear weapon would pose a security threat not only to the region, but also to the United States. But our strong preference is to have meet its international obligations, negotiate diplomatically, to allow them to have peaceful use of nuclear energy in accordance with international law, but at the same time, forswear the weaponization of nuclear power.And so we're going to keep on pushing on that.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, gentlemen. I have one question for the two of you. Canada has announced it's pulling out in 2011; South Korea is already gone. In that context are you concerned about the level of international support for the war here, and are the 20,000 additional U.S. troops enough to bring this conflict to a close? [SEP] Yes. Well, first of all, as you know, I've always relied upon our military commanders to make the recommendations necessary to achieve the objectives we've set forth. We have added troops during—twice during my Presidency—obviously, in the initial move in and then we added troops to that. I've announced we're going to send in more troops. And then, of course, the Obama administration will be analyzing the situation, and it sounds like that they intend to expedite the—sending more troops in.So—and why do we do that? Because this is what our generals suggest we do. To answer your—this is just going to be a long struggle, first of all. This doesn't end tomorrow. Ideological struggles take time. As a civil society whose firm political institutions begin to develop, extremism begins to wither; it gets marginalized, and then it withers away. And so it's going to take time. I can't tell you the troop levels we'll need; all I know is our generals said, this is what we need now. And they—I listened to them, and I'm confident President-elect Obama will listen to the commanders as well. We are already very grateful to all those countries, nations who have come to help Afghanistan, and who have already helped Afghanistan. Canada is among the countries that's the frontrunner in assistance to Afghanistan. Their plans to withdraw their troops by 2011 or '12 is not in contradiction to the understanding that we have with them. They will continue to assist us in various other forms in Afghanistan.What is important here is that while we are continuing to fight terrorism and to bring the institutional strength and stability to Afghanistan, with an improved economy and improved governance and service delivery by the Government, we also work on enabling Afghanistan to eventually stand on its own feet. The Afghan people don't want to be a burden on the international community forever. And we are grateful already that the international community is helping us in blood and their taxpayers' money.We are grateful to Canada. We are grateful to all other countries, as partners for building Afghanistan, for fighting terrorists who are the enemies of all of us. So we are happy in any form of assistance other countries give us and will be grateful for it.One—pick up one more question, Mr. President? You'd like to continue? All those who want another question, raise your hand. [] I guess so, Mr. President.[] Hold on a second.[] I respectfully disagree with you. The Taliban was brutalizing the people of Afghanistan. And they're not in power. And I just cited the progress that is undeniable.Now, is there more work to be done? You bet. I never said the Taliban was eliminated; I said they were removed from power. And I said girls are going back to school, and boys are flying kites, and health clinics are opening, and the number of university students is dramatically expanding, and the number of schools around the country is growing, and there's a ring road built. Yes, there's no question there's a Taliban that wants to fight back. Why? Because they want to regain power. They can't stand the thought of a free society. And they're lethal, and they are tough. No question about it, no question about it.So therefore, is the suggestion because they're tough that we just withdraw, that it's too hard work? Not as far as I'm concerned. I think it's necessary work. And it's in the interest of the United States that we not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven again for Al Qaida. Al Qaida is greatly weakened since 2001. As a matter of fact, they at one point declared the most central front in the war on terror in Iraq, where they're doing very poorly.And they're not doing so well here either. Now, they can hide in remote regions. They can hide, but we will stay on the hunt, and we will keep the pressure on them, because it's in the people—the peaceful people of Afghanistan's interest, just like it's in the interest of this country.And so is there still difficult days ahead? Absolutely. But are the conditions a lot better today in Afghanistan than they were in 2001? Unquestionably, undoubtedly, they're better.[] Mr. President.

We are actively engaged in crafting a strategic framework agreement with the Iraqi government, encompassing cooperation across various domains: diplomacy, economics, and justice. Integral to this agreement is a security component. The Iraqi government seeks an aspirational timeline for transitioning to what we term 'overwatch.' 'Overwatch' signifies that the U.S. will transition to a training mission, providing logistical support and special operations capabilities. For our troops to operate within a foreign nation, a clear understanding with the host government is paramount. This necessitates defined authorities to operate and guarantees for the safety of our personnel. We are currently negotiating these aspects concurrently.

Now you've set some benchmarks on the Maliki Government. You've said that you're expecting him to make tough decisions. Can you tell the American people how you plan to measure his success in reaching those benchmarks, and what happens if he doesn't hit those benchmarks? [SEP] David, the first objective is to develop benchmarks that the Government agrees with and that we think are important. You can't—it's really important for the American people to understand that to say, Okay, these are the benchmarks you must live with, is not going to work nearly as effectively as if we have—when we have buy-in from the Government itself, the sovereign Government of Iraq.And so the step is to say to the Maliki Government—which we're doing—let us work in concert to develop a series of benchmarks to achieve different objectives. And the purpose of that is to assure the Iraqi people that this unity Government is going to work to—for the improvement of the Iraqi people. In other words, it will be beneficial for the Government to say to the Iraqi people, Here is what we intend to do, and here's when we intend to do it.It will also be beneficial for the American people to be able to see that this is going to make the difficult decisions necessary to move forward, to achieve the goal. And that's what we're talking about when it comes to benchmarks. It's—again, I repeat: One should not expect our Government to impose these benchmarks on a sovereign government. You'd expect us to work closely with that Government to come up with a way forward that the Government feels comfortable with.

Furthermore, President Ghani, what gives you hope for reconciliation with the Taliban, and do you seek U.S. involvement in those discussions? [SEP] Let me address the espionage allegations first. It's my policy not to discuss intelligence matters publicly. As for the Iran agreement, we've kept Congress and our allies, including Israel, informed. Any final agreement will be transparent, allowing scrutiny. If it's a solid agreement preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, it will benefit everyone, including American and Israeli security. If not, there won't be an agreement. Regarding Israeli-Palestinian relations, the key issue is the belief of both parties in a possible solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu's pre-election statements suggested no Palestinian state under his leadership. While he later clarified, the conditions he outlined seem unattainable. The question isn't about immediate statehood, but about a framework offering Palestinians hope for a secure state alongside Israel. His statements make this vision difficult. My evaluation concerns the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations, not our commitment to Israel's security. We must be honest about the dim prospects for a two-state solution to maintain credibility.

Even people that are normally against me, like 99.9 percent of the time—[]—because we've been there for 19 years, and everybody would like to see it happen. I was actually surprised. I thought the Schumers of the world would say whatever the opposite is, you know, because that's all they can do. Cryin' Chuck. But people are really—they're really happy to see that we're trying very hard. You know, we're bringing it down to 86—8,600. And from there, we'll make a decision as to what the final outcome would be.But there's been tremendous praise for the fact that we're doing something. You know, other administrations have tried to do something. In particular, the previous administration, for a long time, they were never able to get anything done. And we're really serving not as a military force as we are a police force. And we're not a police force. They have to police their own country. We're not a police force. It's like law enforcement. And that's the way it is.So we'd like to, after 19—I can tell you, after 19 years, we'd like to bring our young people back home. Bring them—that's where they want to be. And we'll always have intelligence there; we'll have other things there. But we'd like to bring them—for the most part, we'd like to bring them back home. We want to watch the area. The area is a hotbed of problems.And when we bring them home, we'll let them know that if something happens, we will hit them so hard. And we could win that easily if I wanted to kill millions of people. I don't want to kill millions of people—innocent people. We could win that very easily. We don't have to act as a police force. We could act as a military force to win, not a military force to just take care of things in that very, very difficult part of the world. It's a very difficult part. It's a very dangerous part of the world.So let's see what happens. So far, so good. So far. But I'm very impressed with the kind of kudos we're getting.Yes, please.", "label": "Deflection"}

Maintaining relations with Russia is crucial, particularly on issues like proliferation and Iran. Putin's proposal to supply enriched uranium to Bushehr was a positive step. We must collaborate with Russia on Iran. Missile defense in Europe is another area where dialogue is essential. We need to assure Russia it's not targeted at them but at genuine threats.

This is my second trip to the continent, and I'm here to emphasize that it's in our interest to help African nations combat diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS, to foster trade, and to invest in education. Seeing it firsthand in Ghana makes a real difference. It's more impactful than just giving speeches back home. Africa has made positive strides during my time as president, largely due to the efforts of African leaders themselves. We've played a role in resolving conflicts, such as in Liberia, where we supported the election of the first female president. Democracy is advancing, thanks to leaders like John Kufuor.

The intention behind these sanctions is to exert considerable pressure on the Russian economy, and the evidence suggests they are achieving this objective. The markets reflect this, with capital flight estimates ranging from $100 to $200 billion. Investment is stagnating, presenting President Putin with a choice: pursue diplomacy in eastern Ukraine, respecting Ukrainian sovereignty, or continue on the current path, which will ultimately harm the Russian economy and its people. We are aligned with our allies in this approach. However, the situation is unresolved, with ongoing conflict and civilian casualties, including the tragic loss of Malaysian Airlines flight.

Obviously, there's a shift in the Congress, and therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who will control the committees; they're the ones who will decide how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats. And in terms of the election, no question Iraq had something to do with it. And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat—which goes to show I should not try punditry—is that this economy is strong. And a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet obviously, there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy— the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war. And so, Jim, look, I understand people don't agree—didn't agree with some of my decisions. I'm going to continue making decisions based upon what I think is right for the country. I've never been one to try to fashion the principles I believe or the decisions I make based upon trying to—kind of short-term popularity. I do understand where the people—the heart of the people. I understand they're frustrated. I am too, as I said the other day. I wish this had gone faster. So does Secretary Rumsfeld. But the reality is, is that it's a tough fight, and we're going to win the fight. And I truly believe the only way we won't win is if we leave before the job is done. Yes, Jim.", "label": "Implicit"}

Every nation assures me Russia won't have a veto over Bucharest's decisions, and I trust them. That's the right approach. I'm committed to Ukraine and Georgia joining MAP. It's in our, NATO's, and their best interests. On missile defense, I've clearly told President Putin it's not aimed at Russia. They could easily overwhelm it. It's for threats from the Middle East, like our Far East systems protect us from single or dual launches. We need to ease suspicions, but we're making progress. Ukraine's NATO membership is about national interest, not targeting anyone. Our history shows collective defense is vital for sovereignty and integrity. Joining MAP is the best response for Ukraine's future. Debates in Europe shouldn't create obstacles. We're on the right track, acting within our sovereignty. The open-door policy shouldn't be replaced by a veto from a non-member. The discussion is overheated, lacking respect. Wisdom should prevail. I want calmness, stability, and security for Ukraine.

If you want to find out what their point of view is about, look what happened in Afghanistan under the brutal relationship of the Taliban and Al Qaida.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people? [SEP] Well, I'm going to—look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning—there are a lot of problems—put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're not going to be—they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.So we're going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that's the reason why I focused as I have.And here's the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division.

{"sentence": "Sir, which specific individuals within the GOP should embrace a more inclusive approach, in your opinion? [SEP] Look, I'm afraid that after a defeat, the temptation will be to look inward and impose rigid ideological tests. This party will recover. But the core message must be that diverse perspectives are valued. Consider the immigration debate. It's clearly a contentious issue. The problem with the initial debate was that some people concluded, 'Republicans don't like immigrants.' Whether that's accurate or not, that's the perception. And if the perception is that we don't like immigrants, then others might think, 'Well, if they don't like immigrants, they probably don't like me either.' So, my point is that our party must be compassionate and broad-minded. I recall the 1964 elections. My father was running for the U.S. Senate and was swept away by the Johnson landslide in Texas. It wasn't just George Bush who lost; the Republican Party was decimated. At least, that's how the pundits saw it. But in '66, there was a resurgence.

And what can the United States do—what more can the United States do to help make food more affordable around the world? [SEP] Yes, actually, I have a little different take. I thought it was 85 percent of the world's food prices are caused by weather, increased demand, and energy prices—just the cost of growing product— and that 15 percent has been caused by ethanol—or the arrival of ethanol.By the way, the high price of gasoline is going to spur more investment in ethanol as an alternative to gasoline. And the truth of the matter is, it's in our national interests that we—our farmers grow energy as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us.In terms of the international situation, we are deeply concerned about food prices here at home, and we're deeply concerned about people who don't have food abroad. In other words, scarcity is of concern to us. Last year, we were very generous in our food donations, and this year, we'll be generous as well. As a matter of fact, we just released about $200 million out of the Emerson Trust as part of a ongoing effort to address scarcity.One thing I think that would be—I know would be very creative policy is if we would buy food from local farmers as a way to help deal with scarcity, but also as a way to put in place an infrastructure so that nations can be self-sustaining and self-supporting.

This isn't a conflict between the U.S. and anyone in Syria; it's the Syrian people against a ruthless dictator. Russia and Iran have consistently supported Assad, making their current actions merely more conspicuous. I conveyed to Putin that the only resolution is a political transition that includes all parties except Assad. I'm prepared to collaborate with Russia if they can broker this transition, but a military solution is untenable. We share a common objective of defeating ISIS, but Putin's inability to differentiate between ISIS and the moderate opposition is a fundamental flaw. We're holding technical talks to avoid aerial clashes. Concerning our support for opposition groups, they are vital for a future political transition. The train-and-equip program has fallen short of expectations because of their preoccupation with Assad's attacks. We're evaluating successful approaches, such as our partnership with the Kurds. Putin's intervention in Syria is indicative of weakness, not strength. His coalition comprises only Iran and Assad, while ours includes the rest of the world.

He'd like to sell Japan military equipment, and there have been reports that the President was disappointed that the Japanese didn't shoot down the North Korean missile that flew over Hokkaido. Did this subject come up? And what did you tell the President about the role you want Japan to play in its defense? [SEP] Let me just add to what the Prime Minister said. He'll shoot them down once he finishes buying all the great military equipment from us. He'll easily shoot them down, just like we did in Saudi Arabia. Amazing shot. Now, the Prime Minister is going to buy massive amounts of military equipment from the United States, and he should. We make the best, by far.

We have different views on some things, but we're pretty aligned on trade. The problem with China is that for decades, it's been a very unfair trade situation. I'm being kind to previous administrations. Our trade deficit is massive, hundreds of billions a year, not even including intellectual property. We've started discussions with China because it has to come down. It has to come down to free, fair, or reciprocal trade. I prefer reciprocal.

It's much more understandable. Reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have countries charging us a hundred-percent tax while we charge them nothing. I've been against that for a long time, and you'll see us do something about it. It takes time, with statutory limitations and notices.

They were tasked with looking at our security structures and programs to make sure they balance our need for security with the rule of law and privacy concerns. I'll make a clear statement in January after talking with people both inside and outside the government. The 215 program, which is about collecting phone numbers and exchanges, has gotten a lot of attention. The NSA thought it was important to track calls from known terrorists outside the US to the US. While there haven't been claims of the NSA misusing this data, people are worried about the possibility of abuse. We need to see if we can achieve the same goals with more public confidence. I'm confident the NSA isn't spying on Americans, but we need to adjust to new technologies. We also need to give the international community more confidence.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, you met a lot of leaders here; many were angry about the NSA story. Have you fixed the relationships with these leaders? And the second question is, many are shocked by the extent of which the NSA collects private data. Today we heard in the New York Times that you plan to end the systematic collection of data of Americans. But can you address the concerns of the Dutch and the rest of the world about their privacy? [SEP] Well, first of all, we have had a consistent, unbreakable bond between the leaders of Europe over the last several decades, and it's across many dimensions: economic, military, counterterrorism, cultural. And so any one issue can be an irritant in the relationship between the countries, but it doesn't define those relationships. And that continues to be the case, and that has been the case throughout the last couple of years.As I said in a speech that I gave earlier this year, the United States is very proud of its record of working with countries around the world to prevent terrorism or nuclear proliferation or human trafficking or a whole host of issues that all of us I think would be concerned about. Intelligence plays a critical role in that process.What we've seen is that as technology has evolved, the guidelines and structures that constrain how our intelligence agencies operated have not kept pace with these advances in technology. And although, having examined over the last year, year and a half what's been done, I'm confident that everybody in our intelligence agencies operates in the best of intentions and is not snooping into the privacy of ordinary Dutch, German, French, or American citizens. What is true is, is that there is a danger because of these new technologies that at some point, it could be abused. And that's why I initiated a broad-based review of what we could do.There are a couple of things that we did that are unprecedented. In my speech, I announced that, for the first time, under my direction, that we are going to treat the privacy concerns of non-U.S. persons as seriously as we are the constraints that already exist by law on U.S. persons. We're doing that not because we're bound by international law, but because ultimately, it's the right thing to do.With respect to some of the aspects of data collection, what I've been very clear about is, is that there has to be a narrow purpose to it, not a broad-based purpose; but it's rather based on a specific concern around terrorism or counterproliferation or human trafficking or something that I think all of us would say has to be pursued.And so what I've tried to do then is to make sure that my intelligence teams are consulting very closely at each stage with their counterparts in other nations so that there's greater transparency in terms of what exactly we're doing, what we're not doing. Some of the reporting here in Europe, as well as the United States, frankly, has been pretty sensationalized. I think the fears about our privacy in this age of the Internet and big data are justified. I think the actual facts—people would have an assurance if—that if you are just the ordinary citizen in any of these countries, that your privacy, in fact, is not being invaded on. But I recognize that because of these revelations, that there's a process that's taking place where we have to win back the trust not just of governments, but more importantly, of ordinary citizens. And that's not going to happen overnight, because I think that there's a tendency to be skeptical of government and to be skeptical in particular of U.S. intelligence services. And so it's going be necessary for us—the step we took that was announced today, I think, is an example of us slowly, systematically putting in more checks, balances, legal processes.The good news is that I'm very confident that it can be achieved, and I'm also confident that the core values that America has always believed in, in terms of privacy, rule of law, individual rights, that that has guided the United States for many years and it will continue to guide us into the future.

{"sentence": "Q. I have a question to the President and then a question to the Chancellor. Mr. President, now Germany tries to have a new action of the Middle East Quartet. And the debate always is how can European powers influence a superpower like the United States? Whether Germany objected Iraq or Tony Blair got along in Iraq, they had not much influence, the pessimists say. Can you give us one example where you changed your mind after talking to a European leader?And, Mrs. Merkel, there are actually few successes of the Quartet over the past time. Were the efforts so weak or are the problems so great that they simply have not been able to achieve progress? And what does this mean? What does this spell out for renewal of efforts? [SEP] I don't know if I'd call this change of mind, but one thing that my European friends have taught me is that the United Nations is an important body in order to be able to convince parliaments of hard work that needs to be done. For example, getting resolutions on at the United Nations is important for a country like Denmark or Holland, in order for them to go to their parliaments and say, We have U.N. approval.As you probably are aware, I've really never felt like the United States needs to get United Nations approval to make decisions necessary for our security. But I have come to realize that other countries do rely upon the United Nations, and I respect that a lot. So there's an area, for example, where I have been taught a lesson by my allies and friends.I listen to Angela Merkel a lot. She has got a lot of wisdom. I don't know if this helps her or hurts her for me to say this, but nevertheless, my consultations with Angela are very productive and very important.The United States needs to have good relations with Europe in order for us to achieve big objectives, whether it be trade or peace or security, it's—the relations between Europe and the United States are vital. And sometimes the relations are—can be difficult. Not every country agrees, throughout Europe. And yet Angela always gives me good advice as to how to deal with the common problems we face in order to make sure that our alliance works for the common good. And I appreciate that very much. I simply think that we ought to try time and again to achieve some sort of results in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Looking at another field, for example, the adoption of the resolution on Iran, after all, we were able, looking at the past months, to forge a uniform position of the international community and have that reflected in a resolution of the United Nations Security Council. I think that's an enormous success, although things went obviously more slowly than if the EU and the United States, for example, had negotiated together.But by including Russia and China time and again in these negotiations, what evolved out of that process is an international community that is credibly being able to show Iran where there is a redline. And I think it's essential to see that the European Union, the United States, China, and Russia need to pull in the same direction on a number of other international issues.And I think it's very important that that goes for the Quartet, for example, too, because that's where I think that we will be able to make—it's an ideal forum where we can actually be able to make a difference and in a coherent fashion.If that Quartet were to be more active, therefore, in the future, the Presidency and also the Commission would obviously also have to meet a very specific task in fulfilling that—its part of the mandate. We need to make it clear, particularly to the not so constructive parts of Hamas, that they cannot play us off each other—us, that is the EU and the United States—but that we pull in the same direction, that we move in concert.And I must say I am a strong believer in this multilateral effort in these international fora, because it shows clearly where the redline is to those who do not wish for democracy. And this is what we need to do, time and again make it clear to them where the limits are, where the redlines are. No back rubs. []", "label": "Explicit"}

[SEP] Well, this letter was re-presented to Mr. President this afternoon. And I've also underlined the fact that a terrorist such as Ferhat Abdi Sahin should not be considered as an interlocutor by a country such as the United States. And this individual, Ferhat Abdi Sahin, has been instrumental in the killings of hundreds of Turkish civilians, and he is a person labeled as like a son for the terrorist leader who is currently incarcerated in Turkey, Abdullah Öcalan.So a person like this should not be welcomed by a country such as the United States. And similarly, this person was welcomed by a country such as Russia. So it's very difficult for me to understand these when we're trying to fight terrorism on a global scale.

Their funding and operations are diminished. It's important to uphold our values. Closing Guantanamo is about that. It's a symbol. We can house them somewhere else. I won't comment on a review I haven't received yet. We've been trying to put our fight against terrorists within a legal structure.

Our goal is to dismantle this network, preventing them from posing a threat to us. And I am encouraged by the unanimous support of our allies in this endeavor. We will not deploy U.S. ground troops in Syria. We must identify and empower effective partners on the ground. The moderate coalition presents a viable option. They have been outmatched, and we must bolster their capabilities. When U.S. forces and our allies apply pressure from the air, ground forces can achieve remarkable results. This strategy is evolving, and we are consulting with our partners. We will take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that ISIS does not threaten the United States or our allies.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the anticipated outcome of the House vote regarding Iraq, and considering your Press Secretary's expressed apprehension about the message being transmitted to our enemies, would you agree that a vote of disapproval serves to embolden them and undermine the efficacy of your policies? Moreover, what specific initiatives are you undertaking to dissuade the Democratic leadership in Congress from imposing limitations on your ability to allocate funds to the Iraq campaign? [SEP] Yes, thank you. A couple of points to address: Firstly, I recognize that Congress intends to express its opinion, and the position of the Democrats, along with some Republicans, is quite clear. I am aware that they disagree with the decision I have made. However, I want to emphasize that this does not imply any judgment on their character or patriotism; they simply hold a different perspective. I have considered their viewpoints, but I remain convinced that their approach would not lead to a nation capable of self-governance, sustainability, and alliance in the war on terror. Secondly, my hope is that this non-binding resolution does not transform into a binding policy that prevents our troops from carrying out the mission I have assigned to them. It is somewhat paradoxical that, on one hand, there is unanimous support for David Petraeus, yet on the other hand, there is reluctance to fund the very strategy he deemed necessary to his job, a strategy he presented before the Senate. I will make it abundantly clear to the Members of Congress, starting now, that they must provide adequate funding for our troops and ensure the necessary flexibility to accomplish the task at hand. Furthermore, I find it interesting that there is a condemnation of a plan that has not yet been given a chance to prove its effectiveness. Again, I understand; I understand.

These commitments predate the communique, showing strong global consensus on this issue.

A strong framework agreed upon by Iran and the P5+1. Some things, like cutting down centrifuges at Natanz or changing Fordow, are locked in. Others are about what we *intend* to do, but the details matter, folks. And those details? They're gonna be negotiated, believe me. Nobody on my team ever said it's all done and dusted.

{"sentence": "Q. Where is your line in the sand? [SEP] Well, look, I've got a whole bunch of lines in the sand. Not making the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent--that was a line in the sand. Making sure that the things that most impact middle class families and low-income families, that those were preserved--that was a line in the sand. I would not have agreed to a deal, which, by the way, some in Congress were talking about, of just a 2-year extension on the Bush tax cuts and 1 year of unemployment insurance, but meanwhile all the other provisions, the earned-income tax credit or other important breaks for middle class families like the college tax credit, that those had gone away just because they had Obama's name attached to them instead of Bush's name attached to them.So this notion that somehow we are willing to compromise too much reminds me of the debate that we had during health care. This is the public option debate all over again. So I pass a signature piece of legislation where we finally get health care for all Americans, something that Democrats had been fighting for, for a hundred years, but because there was a provision in there that they didn't get that would have affected maybe a couple of million people, even though we got health insurance for 30 million people and the potential for lower premiums for a hundred million people, that somehow that was a sign of weakness and compromise.Now, if that's the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles, then let's face it, we will never get anything done. People will have the satisfaction of having a purist position and no victories for the American people. And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are, and in the meantime, the American people are still seeing themselves not able to get health insurance because of preexisting conditions or not being able to pay their bills cause their unemployment insurance ran out.That can't be the measure of how we think about our public service. That can't be the measure of what it means to be a Democrat. This is a big, diverse country. Not everybody agrees with us. I know that shocks people. The New York Times editorial page does not permeate across all of America; neither does the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Most Americans, they're just trying to figure out how to go about their lives and how can we make sure that our elected officials are looking out for us. And that means, because it's a big, diverse country and people have a lot of complicated positions, it means that in order to get stuff done, we're going to compromise. This is why FDR, when he started Social Security, it only affected widows and orphans. You did not qualify. And yet now it is something that really helps a lot of people. When Medicare was started, it was a small program. It grew.Under the criteria that you just set out, each of those were betrayals of some abstract ideal. This country was founded on compromise. I couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding. And if we were really thinking about ideal positions, we wouldn't have a Union.So my job is to make sure that we have a north star out there. What is helping the American people live out their lives? What is giving them more opportunity? What is growing the economy? What is making us more competitive? And at any given juncture, there are going to be times where my preferred option, what I am absolutely positive is right, I can't get done.And so then my question is, does it make sense for me to tack a little bit this way or tack a little bit that way, because I'm keeping my eye on the long term and the long fight--not my day-to-day news cycle, but where am I going over the long term?And I don't think there's a single Democrat out there who, if they looked at where we started when I came into office and look at where we are now, would say that somehow we have not moved in the direction that I promised.Take a tally. Look at what I promised during the campaign. There's not a single thing that I've said that I would do that I have not either done or tried to do. And if I haven't gotten it done yet, I'm still trying to do it.And so the--to my Democratic friends, what I'd suggest is, let's make sure that we understand this is a long game. This is not a short game. And to my Republican friends, I would suggest--I think this is a good agreement, because I know that they're swallowing some things that they don't like as well, and I'm looking forward to seeing them on the field of competition over the next 2 years.Thanks very much everybody.", "label": "Explicit"}

I wanted to get all of us to understand the difficult history of race and encourage people to listen to each other. The passage of the Civil Rights Act or my election didn't erase the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. Things have improved, but we have more work to do.

Do you still maintain that Putin doesn't want a cold war? Has your perspective on him shifted? And if he does invade, would you consider a return to a containment policy akin to what you experienced in the Senate? [SEP] Look, I still don't think he wants a full-blown war, let's be clear. Will he test the West, the US, NATO? Absolutely, he'll push as hard as he can. But mark my words, he'll pay a price, a steep one, that he's not anticipating right now. He'll regret it. Now, let's be frank, he sees the fall of the Soviet Union as a tragedy, the loss of empire, the near abroad gone, all that. But consider what he has: vast territory, resources, but he's stuck between China and the West. So, I'm not entirely sure he knows what he's going to do. My gut tells me he'll make a move. He feels he has to. And I've told him directly, he wants two guarantees: Ukraine never joins NATO, and no strategic weapons in Ukraine. We can talk about the second one, depending on his actions. The first one, well, we have treaties about choosing your alliances. But let's be real, Ukraine joining NATO anytime soon?

{"sentence": "Mr. President, reflecting on the past five years of conflict, what salient lessons will inform your approach during the remaining two years of your administration? [SEP] It is imperative that we analyze the shortcomings encountered. The sectarian violence within Baghdad has demonstrably impeded progress. It constitutes a significant challenge to our efforts to assist the Iraqi government in achieving stability. Our strategic planners are focused on mitigating this violence and empowering the Iraqis to suppress it. The conflict encompasses distinct theaters of operation. Baghdad, characterized by brutal sectarian strife, and the campaign against Sunni extremists. Progress is being made in that latter endeavor. Tensions also exist in the south, primarily of a Shi'a-on-Shi'a nature. However, the most formidable challenge remains within Baghdad. We have not achieved our desired level of progress in enabling the Iraqi government to effectively govern and defend itself. The attack on the Samarra mosque represented a deliberate attempt to incite sectarian discord. Success in Iraq necessitates a confluence of military, political, and reconstruction efforts.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the recent turmoil in the financial sector, do you believe American banks are fundamentally sound? Furthermore, does the government's intervention with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac establish a precedent for future bailouts, potentially encouraging excessive risk-taking by large institutions? [SEP] Let's address Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac first. Many Americans may not fully grasp their significance to the mortgage market. It's crucial that people maintain confidence in these markets and that they remain stable. That's why Secretary Paulson unveiled a plan this past weekend, requesting authorization from Congress for a line of credit for these institutions, if necessary, and the authority to invest capital, if needed. The primary goal was to reassure everyone that we understand the importance of these institutions to the mortgage markets and to alleviate any anxieties. By outlining this plan, we actually reduce the likelihood of needing to use this authority in the first place, which, I want to emphasize, is only temporary. Now, regarding the banks, if you have a deposit in an American commercial bank, it's insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. So, if you hear concerns about your bank's condition, depositors should understand that the FDIC is there to protect their deposits up to that amount. I recall witnessing a bank run in Midland, Texas, where someone was shouting, 'Your deposits are good! We've got you insured!' But people were still nervous. My hope is that people will take a breath and realize their deposits are protected. So, these are two distinct issues: the mortgage markets and the banking sector.", "label": "General"}

[SEP] Indeed, I discussed with Mr. President the various aspects of a permanent U.S. military presence in Poland. However, let me be clear: such bases should not be interpreted as a provocation that would lead to increased Russian aggression and militarization. Russia has been systematically militarizing areas like Kaliningrad for over a decade. From Georgia in 2008 to the annexation of Crimea, their actions speak for themselves. The U.S. presence is a guarantee of security and defense for our part of Europe, for the free world. We seek both U.S. and NATO forces to protect our interests. The President and his advisors will consider all factors, but the arguments for a U.S. presence are strong, given the ongoing violations of international law. Deterrence is the most effective way to prevent war. President Trump also mentioned Poland's willingness to contribute financially, reflecting his focus on burden-sharing.

{"sentence": "President Obama, in light of the congressional stalemate surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, what contingency plans are in place to ensure its eventual passage, and is there room for negotiation regarding currency manipulation clauses? Furthermore, what implications does the recent targeted killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur have for the future of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan? [SEP] Look, on TPP, I've been doing this long enough to know that every trade deal is a dogfight. Everyone wants a better deal, and with so many countries involved, they're going to nitpick it, debate it to death, and in an election year, try to score some political points. That being said, I'm still optimistic we'll get it done, because it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country, good for America, good for the region, good for the whole world. This is the fastest-growing part of the globe, a huge market for the United States. Most of these countries already sell their stuff to us with relatively low tariffs. Meanwhile, tariffs are much higher for U.S. goods being sold over there. So a deal that eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in the largest, fastest-growing markets is a no-brainer for American businesses and workers. One of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that they open our markets to countries with lower wages, unfair labor practices, and weak environmental protections. But if you're signing up for TPP, you're making legally binding commitments to raise labor standards, give workers a voice, and address environmental problems. That gives us the opportunity to engage with countries like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts. I haven't heard a single convincing argument that we'll be worse off with TPP. It's clear as day that we'll be better off. American workers and businesses will benefit if we get this deal passed. The politics will be messy, just like they were with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too. Regarding currency manipulation, we've got provisions in TPP that improve transparency and reporting. Some people have argued that we should have enforceable rules that allow us to impose tariffs on countries that devalue their currency too much. But the problem is, it's really hard to figure out why a currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated. And frankly, forcing other countries to make commitments about their monetary policy would mean we'd be tying the hands of our own Federal Reserve, and we're not going to do that. We have strengthened the provisions that will allow us to put countries on notice that we think are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, about the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, it's been confirmed that he's dead. He was the guy calling the shots, specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops in Afghanistan. This doesn't mean we're changing our strategy. We're not going back to day-to-day combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country. But when we've got a high-profile leader who's been consistently involved in operations and plans to harm U.S. personnel and who's been blocking peace talks, then it's my responsibility as Commander in Chief to step in and send a clear message to the Taliban that we're going to protect our people.

I guess they had 39 different occasions where they were able to see him or potentially see him. We want to be very powerful, very strong on background checks and especially as it pertains to the mentally ill. We're going to get rid of the bump stocks, and we're going to do certain other things.But one of the feelings that I have, and you probably heard me in a speech this morning—very, very important that we have offensive capability as well as defensive capability that's within the schools. Because when you have a gun-free zone, you're really inviting people to come in and do whatever you have to do and, oftentimes, get out.Now, I was the one that brought up the fact that these shootings, on average, last 3 minutes, and it takes anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes for the police to get to the site. And I want to have people in the building. And, in many cases, you have ex-marines and ex-Army and Navy and Air Force and Coast Guard—you have them in the building, and they can have concealed weapons and still be teachers, or they could be in the building in a different capacity.But we have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage. But we'll be putting in strong language having to do with the background checks, and that will take place very quickly.I spoke with Paul Ryan this morning, with Mitch McConnell, and people are looking to really energize. I know that you've had—this has been going on for a long time. Many, many years. And you've had people in my position, and they would mention things, but not a lot of things got done, obviously. We take it very seriously. We want to put an end to it.And if, by the way, the bad guy thinks that somebody is in this room with a weapon that's going to be pointed at him with live bullets, he's not even going into the school. It's the one way you're going to solve it. You're not going to solve it with gun-free spaces, because they'll get in there, and they're going to be the only one with a gun. So we need offensive capability, and we're going to be doing something about it. We're dealing with Congress right now.Thank you. Thank you.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "President, could you detail what you discussed with Prime Minister Najib regarding the corruption allegations? [SEP] On the refugee issue, the Paris attacks are still fresh in our minds. People are naturally concerned, and that's shaped policy. However, we must remember the rigorous vetting process refugees face, often taking up to two years. The House bill, while seemingly straightforward, could undermine the refugee program, hurting those who need it most. My 'values' comment was about the notion of favoring certain religions or fearing defenseless children. Regarding Prime Minister Najib, I generally avoid commenting on ongoing investigations, particularly in foreign nations. But I did emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and combating corruption, which are vital for development. I also stressed the role of civil society and a free press. Countries develop at different speeds, but these principles are essential. Myanmar's elections are a positive development, and we aim to support such progress through initiatives like the Open Government Partnership and TPP.

{"sentence": "Q. ——economic environment. What do you think the future holds for that? Do you think the trend is a good one or a bad one? [SEP] I hope the trend is bad against protectionism. A disappointment— not a mistake, but a disappointment—was not getting the three trade bills out of Congress on Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. That was a disappointment. I actually thought we had a shot at one time, and then I was disappointed that they didn't move out of the House.And I am concerned about protectionism. In tough economic times, the temptation is to say, well, let's just throw up barriers and protect our own and not compete. That was the sentiment, by the way, that was in place during decent economic times. After all, we got CAFTA out of the Congress by one vote. And it would be a huge mistake if we become a protectionist nation.And that might be a good thing for the Bush Center to do at SMU, is to remind people about the benefits of free and fair trade: benefits for our own workers, benefits for workers overseas, and benefits when it comes to promoting development and helping lift people out of poverty, in particularly, third world countries. The best way to enhance economic growth in a third world country and to give people a chance to realize a better future is through trade. It's been proven; it's a fact.

[SEP] Well, I acknowledge that Congress will voice its opinion, and the Democrats' stance, along with some Republicans, is clear. They disagreed with my initial decision, but that doesn't mean they're unpatriotic—they just have a different opinion. I considered their views but felt they wouldn't lead to a nation capable of governing itself, sustaining itself, and being an ally in the war on terror. However, I hope this non-binding resolution doesn't become a binding policy that prevents our troops from doing what I've asked them to do. It's inconsistent to unanimously support David Petraeus and then refuse to fund the strategy he deemed necessary, as he testified before the Senate. I'm making it very clear to Congress, starting now, that they need to fund our troops and ensure we have the necessary flexibility to get the job done.

Isn't it time for you to at least consider unraveling that particular change? [SEP] False, if you didn't hear me. Now, we got a great relationship. And it's—we're working on a variety of issues. Listen, our special relationship has been forged in common values in history, and we're making history together. And we're dealing with a lot of problems. The most severe problem, as far as I'm concerned, is the willingness of people to murder innocent people to achieve their political objectives. I mean, this is the fundamental threat facing civilization in the 21st century.And Prime Minister Brown sees the threat. I mean, he had to live through the threat. And so it's—our relationship is very special, and it's—I'm confident future Presidents will keep it that way. There's just such a uniqueness in the relationship. That's not to say you can't have other friends, and we do. But this is a unique relationship, truly is. And I value my personal friendship as well as our—the relationship between our countries.Look, if there wasn't a personal relationship, I wouldn't be inviting the man to a nice hamburger or something—[]—well done, I might add. I'm very proud to be here today to celebrate a special relationship. In 1941, Winston Churchill met Franklin Roosevelt and inaugurated what is the modern phase of that special relationship. And Churchill said at the time, Same language, same hymns. He said, Same ideals, same values, something big is happening. And what was big that happened was that never before has a relationship yielded so much in the 1940s against—in the fight against fascism and the cold war that then followed, where we worked together. In the fight against terrorism, we're—as Tony Blair said, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the American people and with And I continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with him in rooting out terrorism wherever we find it, in any part of the world which puts freedom, democracy, and justice at risk.And what I think is fascinating is that over the next few months, we will be developing that special relationship in new ways, a special relationship of peoples as well as of governments: more cooperation between our universities and more exchanges between young people in Britain and young people in America; more scientific cooperation; more cooperation in the fight against cancer, whether a joint project—the Human Genome Project—where we're working together; environmental action, where the institutes in Britain and America are agreeing this week to have more cooperation; and right across the board, as we take the English language, Britain and America, and make it a gift and then offer it to the rest of the world to make it possible for millions of people in different parts of the world to learn the English language.So this is a special relationship not just of governments, but of peoples. And I look forward to its enhancement at all levels in the years to come. And I will work as hard as President Bush to make that relationship as strong and as enduring for the future.You asked also about our economic policies. We have low inflation; therefore, we've brought down interest rates. We have low debt; therefore, we can afford to spend more.We've made a major tax reform. And you ask about the 10p rate. Let's not forget that this April, the tax rate in Britain, the basic rate of tax is going down from 22 pence to 20 pence. We've virtually doubled child benefit for families over the last 10 years and raised it again this year, and we'll raise it next year. We're raising the child tax credit. We've got a new winter allowance addition for pensioners so that they can meet the fuel bills. And every area where the 10p rate has affected people, whether it be low-paid workers or pensioners or whether it be families with children, we have acted to see that we could do the best by people in our country.Now, of course, a tax reform is a big thing, but when you're reducing the basic rate from 22 pence to 20 pence—the first time it's been achieved, the lowest tax rate, basic tax rate for 75 years—it is an important thing to do. And I'm satisfied that once people understand the scale of the good things that we have been able to do in reforming the tax system and making it bet-ter—and that we're tackling poverty, as they do in America, by introducing and increasing tax credits for the poorest people—then whatever questions people have about these changes can be answered.Yes, they're important changes. They move the British economy forward. We have just seen this week that despite all the world difficulties, we have the highest employment rates at any time in our history. We have lower unemployment than at any time for 30 years. We have more vacancies in the economy, and that, combined with low inflation, a stable economy, lower interest rates—as we've managed to achieve over the last few weeks—means that the British economy is well positioned to face the challenges of the future and will continue to be so.And my answer to people who say what is happening domestically is, we are taking the right long-term decisions for the British economy, whether it's on nuclear power or on housing or on planning or infrastructure. And of course, at some times, people ask questions about whether you're doing the right thing. But we will see these long-term changes through, and these are the right long-term changes for Britain and for the British people. You guys want to sit out here for the afternoon or—[].

We've been sticking to that plan, which involves handing over more and more responsibility to the Afghans, with the aim of ending our combat role by the end of 2014. Our allies are on board with this, and that's still the plan. What we'll be doing at the NATO meeting, and in the next couple of years, is making sure that this transition isn't a sudden drop-off. We're talking about setting benchmarks and taking steps along the way, just like we did when we scaled back our involvement in Iraq. It needs to be gradual, so the Afghan security forces can build their capacity, and we can partner with them effectively. We also need to make sure the support structures are in place for the whole thing to work. Now, the Koran burning situation is a concern, no doubt about it. It highlights the challenges on the ground, and it underscores the need for us to transition. The violence directed at our people is unacceptable, and President Karzai has acknowledged that. But he's also keen to take on more responsibility, and we're going to find a way to make sure the Afghans feel their sovereignty is being respected and that they're taking a bigger role in their own security.

We have achieved a record-breaking sequence of consecutive months of job creation, and our fiscal deficit is demonstrably contracting.

Our Gross Domestic Product growth is attributable, in significant measure, to export activity, which underscores the existence of positive elements within our economic framework. The central question before us is how best to assist homeowners. I do not advocate for the provision of bailouts to lending institutions; rather, we must implement policies that empower individuals to retain ownership of their homes. The FHA modernization bill is of paramount importance in this regard, as it will broaden the reach of the FHA and facilitate refinancing opportunities for a greater number of citizens. The securitization of mortgages has engendered complexities in accessing refinancing assistance. We must endeavor to enhance public understanding of mortgage instruments and streamline the refinancing process. Secretaries Paulson and Jackson are actively collaborating with the private sector to address these challenges. Furthermore, we must reform the tax code to eliminate the disincentive associated with refinancing. Ultimately, market forces will dictate equilibrium as the supply of housing adjusts to meet demand.

How much influence does China wield over North Korea, and what repercussions would a test have on U.S.-China relations? [SEP] Look, it's tough to say definitively how much control China has. I've made it plain to President Xi that they should discourage North Korea from these tests. And I've also stated that if North Korea proceeds, we'll take defensive measures. These aren't against China, but they'll send a message to North Korea. We'll protect our allies and ourselves. Whether China can stop them, I don't know. But I'm sure China doesn't want escalation. I've been clear we'll defend ourselves and allies like South Korea and Japan. This might create friction with China, but it's about North Korea's actions. We have teams working with their Chinese counterparts. We won't solve everything, but I don't see a new Cold War. I want to be clear with Xi Jinping that I mean what I say. Misunderstandings are the biggest danger. The meeting was long, we covered a lot. He was direct. Understanding each other is key.

[SEP] It took me a while to get my bearings, that's for sure. This job is truly unique. It's a non-stop flow of information and problems, even more so today because of how connected the world is. Things that used to be isolated now have global effects almost instantly. The speed of information and the need to react quickly are unlike anything else. I shared these thoughts with the President-elect, stressing the importance of having the right people around you, especially the Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and White House Counsel. You need a good system for getting information and making choices. I've been lucky to have an amazing team, which has helped me make good decisions. I also talked about the need for unity and representing everyone, like he said on election night. His first actions and how he comes across will be key in setting the tone for his presidency.

People leave, people go. As for Afghanistan, it's been a long road. We're working with everyone to find the best path forward. The Taliban has made commitments, and we're holding them accountable.

It seems their priorities lie elsewhere. Therefore, while I advocated for its inclusion, the reality of the political landscape necessitates compromise.

They want a timeline for transitioning to 'overwatch,' where the US provides training, logistics, and special ops. For our troops to be there, we need an understanding with the Iraqi government.

The economy is growing, though financial uncertainty persists. People need assurance that their bank deposits are insured. It's a period of uncertainty, with numerous events unfolding simultaneously. However, we can enact legislation to expedite the recovery, such as housing legislation. Congress needs to act. Another signal would be to explore domestic oil production. While we transition away from hydrocarbons, we should wisely utilize our resources. A concerted effort to develop oil shale reserves would relieve pressure on gasoline prices. Furthermore, we haven't built a new refinery in decades, which is nonsensical. Permitting is incredibly difficult, discouraging investment. We import a significant amount of refined product. We can also promote trade. The decision on the Colombia free trade agreement is baffling. Colombia enjoys preferential treatment, yet we don't receive the same. Our exports have supported the economy, so expanding trade opportunities makes sense. Turning our back on a courageous ally like Uribe is senseless. Politics is hindering progress.

The question is, how do we construct a political bridge that ensures the equities of Assad's allies – Russia and Iran – are respected, and that minorities like the Alawites are protected? That's the crux of the matter. If Assad had made a different choice earlier, prioritizing his country over himself, this transition would be far easier. Now, it's more complicated.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, after a year of divided government, you initially expressed optimism about finding common ground with Democrats. However, your remarks today suggest a less positive outlook. How would you assess your own efforts to work with Democrats this past year? How effective have you been in achieving bipartisan cooperation, and do you believe you've succeeded in finding common ground? [SEP] We're finding common ground on Iraq. I recognize there are people in Congress that say we shouldn't have been there in the first place. But it sounds to me as if the debate has shifted, that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker's testimony made a difference to a lot of Members. I hope we continue to find ground by making sure our troops get funded. We found common ground on FISA. My only question is, why change a good law? The way that law was written works for the security of the country. That's what the American people want to know, by the way. Are we passing laws that are beneficial to the American people? This law is beneficial because it enables our intelligence experts to find out the intentions of Al Qaida. Now, the law needs to be changed, enhanced by providing the phone companies that allegedly helped us with liability protection. So we found common ground there. Hopefully, we can find common ground as the Congress begins to move pieces of legislation. The reason I said what I said today is, there's a lot to be done. As you recognize, I'm not a member of the legislative branch; probably wouldn't be a very good legislator. But as the head of the executive branch, it makes sense to call upon Congress to show progress and get results. It's hard to find common ground unless important bills are moving. They're not even moving. And not one appropriations bill has made it to my desk. How can you find common ground when there's no appropriations process? We found common ground on a trade bill--trade bills, really important pieces of legislation, as far as I'm concerned. One of the reasons why is, exports helped us overcome the weakness in the housing market last quarter. If that's the case, it seems like it makes sense to continue and open up markets to goods and services. And yet there hadn't been one--there haven't been any bills moving when it comes to trade. Veterans Affairs is an area where we can find common ground. I've called in--I asked Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead an important Commission, a Commission to make sure our veterans get the benefits they deserve. I was concerned about bureaucratic delay and the--concerned about a system that had been in place for years, but this didn't recognize this different nature--a different kind of war that we're fighting. I don't like it when I meet wives who are sitting by--beside their husbands' bed in Walter Reed and not being supported by its Government, not being helped to provide care. I'm concerned about PTSD, and I want people to focus on PTSD. And so we sent up a bill, and I hope they move on it quickly. There's a place where we can find common ground.", "label": "General"}

Will you commit to disclosing contributions as they are received, and will there be any limitations on donor types or donation amounts? [SEP] Look, let's be clear. First, the budget is still being finalized. Second, as the foundation chairman, Donnie Evans, has stated, we'll adhere to all disclosure requirements.

We're assured that they're safe. But have you sufficiently prepared the American people for the costs of war--of course, the human costs, but also the financial costs? [SEP] Let me first of all say, obviously, we were extraordinarily relieved to find out that these two young men were safe in American hands. As the Pentagon indicated, this appears to have been a malfunction in the aircraft, and it is a testament to our military that we had fully prepared for any contingency, including something like this, and they were able to recover these individuals rapidly.And in fact, as part of the planning effort leading up to this, I specifically had discussions with Admiral Mullen and other of our military personnel to make sure that we had the kind of standard recovery efforts in place, because there are risks involved. And on the day that I indicated that this was a possibility, and then on the day that I indicated that we, in fact, were moving forward, I said that there is no military operation that does not entail risk. And that's why this is always the most difficult decision that I make as Commander in Chief and as President of the United States.Now, I have absolutely no doubt that we will be able to transfer control of this operation to an international coalition. I had discussions with Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy today. In fact, NATO is meeting today as we speak to work out some of the mechanisms for command and control. I would expect that over the next several days you will have clarity and a meeting of the minds of all those who are participating in the process.We're already seeing a significant reduction in the number of U.S. planes that are involved in operations over Libya, because, as I said initially, our job was to take our unique capabilities and create a space to shape the environment so that the operation of a no-fly zone could operate effectively and to make sure that our immediate humanitarian goals could be met.And I just want to emphasize to the American people, because of the extraordinary capabilities and valor of our men and women in uniform, we have already saved lives. In Benghazi, a city of 700,000 people, you had the prospect of Qadhafi's forces carrying out his orders to show no mercy. That could have resulted in catastrophe in that town. Qadhafi's forces have pulled back because of this timely intervention.And obviously, there are always risks involved in this kind of operation, but for us to be able to structure something where we bring our unique capabilities to bear to fulfill a mission that is supported by the international community against somebody who was about to direct his armed forces against his people in the most vicious of ways is something that, I think, the American people, and certainly our American military, should be proud of.I said at the outset that this was going to be a matter of days and not weeks.

Are you listening to the voters, or are you listening to the Vice President? And what does that mean? [SEP] David, I believe Iraq had a lot to do with the election, but I believe there was other factors as well. People want their Congressmen to be honest and ethical. So in some races, that was the primary factor. There were different factors that determined the outcome of different races, but no question, Iraq was on people's minds. And as you have just learned, I am making a change at the Secretary of Defense to bring a fresh perspective as to how to achieve something I think most Americans want, which is a victory.We will work with Members of Congress; we will work with the Baker-Hamilton commission. My point is, is that while we have been adjusting, we will continue to adjust to achieve the objective. And I believe that's what the American people want.Somehow it seeped in their conscious that my attitude was just simply, stay the course. Stay the course means, let's get the job done, but it doesn't mean staying stuck on a strategy or tactics that may not be working. So perhaps I need to do a better job of explaining that we're constantly adjusting. And so there's fresh perspective—so what the American people hear today is, we're constantly looking for fresh perspective.But what's also important for the American people to understand is that if we were to leave before the job is done, the country becomes more at risk. That's what the Vice President was saying. He said, If the job is not complete, Al Qaida will have safe haven from which to launch attacks. These radicals and extremists have made it clear they want to topple moderate governments to spread their ideology.

{"sentence": "Q. Yes, my name is Moon—[inaudible]. I'm affiliated to Dong-A Ilbo Daily Newspaper. I have a question for President Moon: Between Korea and the United States, I think one of the most important diplomatic challenges would be to overcome—to resolve the nuclear problem of the D.P.R.K. And you gave a foreign press interview; you talked about bringing balance and diplomacy, and you talked about resolving nuclear problem and the close cooperation between Korea and the United States, and you talked about the China's role.Are you referring to the balance between the U.S.—balance of Korea between U.S. and China, or are you referring to something else? And you have had a third summit meeting at the summit meeting you just had. You said that you have agreed to bring permanent peace to—[inaudible]—on the Korean Peninsula. And what kind of role are you expecting the United States and President Trump to play with regards to settling peace on the Korean Peninsula? [SEP] Yes, on the bringing balance in our diplomatic approaches, this is not about our stance vis-à-vis the United States and the China. We are trying to bring a solution to the nuclear problem—D.P.R.K. nuclear problem—and to bring permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.And moreover, we would like to promote peace, stability, and prosperity of the Northeast Asian region. So we would like to expand our diplomatic efforts in this regard. And that should include our efforts for China, as well as ASEAN and Russia and the EU. I believe that we should diversify efforts—diplomatic efforts—so that we can pursue a more balanced approach. So that was the intention of making such comments.And to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and to overcome and to resolve the nuclear problem, I think there's role to be played by the United States and China. And when it comes to the United States, a very strong sanctions and pressure is being put by the United States. The U.S. is leading efforts, and I am very sure that substantive results will be realized through such efforts. And China has also faithfully implemented the U.N. resolution to impose sanctions on D.P.R.K. So we have heightened the pressure and sanctions on D.P.R.K., and I think this will also contribute to resolving the n nuclear problem.And if our international society's efforts bear fruits—if such efforts bear fruits—and if we can really make a turnaround, then I'm sure that we will be able to bring to the table of dialogue. And through such dialogue, I am very confident that we can freeze the nuclear program and ultimately dismantle the weapons program of the D.P.R.K. entirely. And in this, I believe that cooperation from the U.S. and China is essential.And on the establishing a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, I don't think it's the right time even that we talk about this issue. Now we should focus on bringing an end to the D.P.R.K. provocations and bringing D.P.R.K. to the table for dialogue. This is the impending challenge that we must address now. So we must focus on the sanctions and pressure. And when there is a turnaround—when the turnaround finally comes—then we should certainly make efforts to further consult each other—Korea and the U.S.—for settling peace on the Korean Peninsula. . I want to just say that President Xi—where we will be tomorrow, China—has been very helpful. We'll find out how helpful soon. But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with . We hope that Russia, likewise, will be helpful. We also hope that other countries—and we know for a fact that other countries have already started. And we've had great dialogue with many other countries, as you know, and they're really helping a lot.So if we get China, if we get Russia—and we have some other countries, but we want to get most of them—we think that things will happen, and they could happen very quickly.This is a problem, by the way, that should have been done over the last 25 years, not now. This is not the right time to be doing it, but that's what I've got. That's what I've got. This is a problem that should have been taken care of a long time ago.Thank you. Thank you.

{"sentence": "Q. But sectoral sanctions will only happen with European approval? [SEP] No. I didn't say only, never, when. I said this is our strategy. And I want to emphasize, every time I address this question, there is a diplomatic path to resolving this issue. The Geneva statement pointed towards how we could resolve this statement. What it asks of the Russians is hardly onerous: Make a public statement that those militias need to lay down their arms and exit those buildings; participate with international observers and monitors, rather than stand by while they're being bullied and, in some cases, detained by these thugs; negotiate with the Ukrainian Government and engage in some confidence-building measures. I mean, these aren't heavy lifts if the Russians are sincere in wanting to resolve this problem. So far, we haven't seen that, but we're going to keep on raising the consequences of Russia rejecting that path towards diplomacy.With respect to the statements by the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers—for our Malaysian audience, this is a sports team, basketball team, in the United States. The owner is reported to have said some incredibly offensive, racist statements that were published. I don't think I have to interpret those statements for you; they kind of speak for themselves. When people—when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk. [] And that's what happened here.I have confidence that the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, a good man, will address this. Obviously, the NBA is a league that is beloved by fans all across the country. It's got an awful lot of African American players. It's steeped in African American culture. And I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this.I will make just one larger comment about this. We—the United States continues to wrestle with a legacy of race and slavery and segregation that's still there, the vestiges of discrimination. We've made enormous strides, but you're going to continue to see this percolate up every so often. And I think that we just have to be clear and steady in denouncing it, teaching our children differently, but also remaining hopeful that part of why some statements like this stand out so much is because there have been a shift—there has been this shift in how we view ourselves.And like Malaysia, we constantly have to be on guard against racial attitudes that divide us rather than embracing our diversity as a strength. And I know that the people of Malaysia are committed to wrestling with those issues as well. We have to make sure that we stay on top of it, and we will.Even though it wasn't directed at me, I am going to say one thing about TPP, this notion somehow that some protests here might indicate U.S. bullying. Keep in mind, I've got protests back home from my own party about TPP. So there's never been a trade deal in which somebody is not going to at some point object because they're fearful of the future or they're invested in the status quo. And I think it's just very important for everybody to wait and see what exactly is the agreement that has been negotiated before folks jump to conclusions. You take an issue like drugs, for example, the United States does extraordinary work in research and development and providing medical breakthroughs that save a lot of lives around the world. Those companies that make those investments in that research oftentimes want a return, and so there are all kinds of issues around intellectual property and patents and so forth.At the same time, I think we would all agree that if there's a medicine that can save a lot of lives, then we've got to find a way to make sure that it's available to folks who simply can't afford it as part of our common humanity. And both those values are reflected in the conversations and negotiations that are taking place around TPP. So the assumption somehow that right off the bat, that's not something we're paying attention to, that reflects lack of knowledge of what is going on in the negotiations.But my point is, you shouldn't be surprised if there are going to be objections, protests, rumors, conspiracy theories, political aggravation around a trade deal. You've been around long enough, Chuck. That's true in Malaysia, it's true in Tokyo, it's true in Seoul. It's true in the United States of America, and it's true in the Democratic Party.So I continue to strongly believe, however, that this is going to be the right thing to do, creating jobs, creating businesses, expanding opportunity for the United States. And it's going to be good for countries like Malaysia that have been growing rapidly, but are interested in making that next leap to the higher value aspects of the supply chain that can really boost income growth and development. I'd just like to echo what President Obama said. Emphatically, in no uncertain terms, we went to the TPP on our own accord. We were not bullied into it. And I can attest to our commitment towards free trade as to principle and philosophy, because we have entered into 13 separate FTA agreements with other countries.So Malaysia is a great believer in free trade. But we also understand that the benefits of free trade like boosting trade, creating wealth, jobs—those are the good things. But there will be some losers in the process; there will be winners and losers. But overall, the benefit, I think—it's important for us to show to the people in Malaysia that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages of a free trade agreement.And this is what, in a final analysis, what we have to do, because the underpinnings of a free trade agreement would be acceptance by the people. And we are committed to that process. We'll engage with the public, and we'll also present it to parliament.So we are working out around the sensitivities and challenges, which I alluded to in my discussions with He fully understands our domestic sensitivities, and we will sit down and try to iron this out with the intention of trying to work out a deal in the near future.", "label": "Dodging"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, General Mattis has described China as a revisionist power, yet you maintain a positive relationship with President Xi. Is China a friend or foe? And regarding North Korea, if sanctions prove ineffective, are all options still under consideration? [SEP] Well, regarding North Korea, we'll just have to wait and see. I'm not going to reveal my strategy at this time. However, if the sanctions do not work, we will have to move to phase two, which could be a very difficult and unfortunate situation for the world. We are hopeful that the sanctions will be effective. We have tremendous support from around the world for our efforts. North Korea is truly a rogue nation. If we can reach a deal, it would be a great achievement. If not, then something will have to happen. So, we'll see.As for General Mattis, he holds that view, and many others share it. China is a formidable nation, growing stronger, largely due to the financial gains they have made because of poor leadership in the United States. The United States leadership has allowed them to get away with murder.That being said, I believe we can establish a truly great and balanced trading relationship with China. Hopefully, that will come to fruition. And hopefully, the relationship I have with President Xi will facilitate that. Only time will tell.I can confirm that President Trump and President Xi see eye-to-eye in every respect. The respect they have for each other is evident at the meetings I've attended in the region, such as the East Asia Summit and APEC. It's the most important relationship, characterized by respect, frankness, and clear-sightedness.For our part, we see China's rise as overwhelmingly positive for the region and the world. The critical factor, of course, is maintaining the rule of law.There are those who want to portray the United States and its allies, like Australia, as being against China in some sort of rerun of the Cold War. That is not accurate.We need to ensure that the rules of the road, the rule of law, and the rules-based system are upheld, where big countries can't push around little countries; where, to quote Lee Kuan Yew, you don't have a world where the big fish eat the little fish and the little fish eat the shrimps. Maintaining that rules-based order is what we are committed to, and we all have a vested interest in doing so.The President's personal presence in our region at the end of last year sent a powerful message. The regular visits by Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, and the presence of the United States Navy are so important to maintaining that rules-based order. It has been the foundation of our success, prosperity, and security for the last 40 years.I don't think we've ever had a better relationship with China than we do right now. The only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it's so one-sided, it's so lopsided. And the people that stood here for many years in this position should never have allowed that to happen. It's very unfair to the United States, and it's very unfair to the workers of the United States.Even today, it's extremely hard on companies that want to do business in China, because the barriers are incredible, whereas the barriers coming into our country are foolishly not. I believe in reciprocal trade. If they do something to us, we do something to them. Well, that never happened, and it's gotten worse and worse over the years. But we'll correct it.

What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think it's a very fair question. I had a very good meeting with the G-7. And I left the meeting. And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries. Very, very seriously. Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason. For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second—$151 billion we lost. They were represented at the meeting. And we're being taken advantage of on trade.Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits. We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus. Not a surplus. It's either 17, but it could actually be 100. You know, they put out a document. I don't know if you saw it. They didn't want me to see it, but we found it. Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have. It's close to $100 billion-a-year loss with Canada. They don't take our farm products, many of them. They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products. And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country: the workers, the farmers, the companies. And we are not able to trade. They have tremendous barriers up. They have tremendous tariffs.So when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much—it's like this—they said, Oh, that's so terrible. I said: What's terrible? We have to catch you a little bit. We have to have a little balance. Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance. I say this with many countries.Anyway, we came—we finished the meeting. Really, everybody was happy. And I agreed to sign something. I asked for changes; I demanded changes. And those changes were made. In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document, because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.That was a very friendly—I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways. I was angry at her or she—actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.Anyway, I left, and it was very friendly. When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television. And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. And I say, push him around? We just shook hands. It was very friendly.Look, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade. The numbers are out. Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years—but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China. Eight-hundred billion dollars. A hundred fifty-one billion with the European Union. They don't take our agricultural products, barely. They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions. It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers.

So what is something concrete, sir, that you achieved today to prevent that from happening again? And what were the consequences you threatened? [SEP] Whether I stopped it from happening again—he knows I will take action, like we did when—this last time out. What happened was: We, in fact, made it clear that we were not going to continue to allow this to go on. The end result was, we ended up withdrawing—they went withdrawing Ambassadors, and we closed down some of their facilities in the United States, et cetera. And he knows there are consequences.Now, look, one of the consequences that I know—I don't know; I shouldn't say this; it's unfair of me—I suspect you may all think doesn't matter, but I'm confidence it matters to him—confident it matters to him and other world leaders of big nations: his credibility worldwide shrinks.Let's get this straight: How would it be if the United States were viewed by the rest of the world as interfering with the elections directly of other countries, and everybody knew it?

I know in the cases of some of these other uprisings there's been a careful consideration not to take sides, let the Libyan--let the people in those countries make this decision. But in this case, it does seem we have taken sides. So what--what's the red line here? [SEP] Well, first of all, let's take a look at what we've already done. My first priority obviously was getting out American citizens and Embassy personnel out of Libya, and we got that done. The very next day, we had already instituted the largest financial seizure of assets in our history. And the day after that, we'd imposed sanctions and we had mobilized the international community through the United Nations so that across the board we are slowly tightening the noose on Qadhafi. He is more and more isolated internationally, both through sanctions as well as an arms embargo.In addition to that, we've provided a host of humanitarian aid measures to make sure that people are not adversely affected as they cross the borders into Tunisia or Egypt. And we will continue to do that.And what we've done is we've organized in NATO a series of conversations about a wide range of options that we can take, everything from 24-hour surveillance so that we can monitor the situation on the ground and react rapidly if conditions deteriorated, to further efforts with respect to an arms embargo, additional efforts on humanitarian aid, but also potential military options including a no-fly zone.NATO will be meeting on Tuesday to consider a no-fly zone, and we've been in discussions with both Arab countries as well as African countries to gauge their support for such an action.In addition, Secretary Hillary Clinton will be meeting with the opposition in the next several days, and we have determined that it's appropriate for us to assign a representative whose specific job is to interact with the opposition and determine ways that we can further help them. And so we're going to be in close consultation with them.So the bottom line is, is that I have not taken any options off the table at this point. I think it is important to understand that we have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions on Qadhafi. I am absolutely clear that it is in the interest of the United States and, more importantly, in the interest of the Libyan people for Mr. Qadhafi to leave. And I have not foreclosed these options.Now, I do take very seriously making sure that any decisions I make that involve U.S. military power are well thought through and are done in close consultation with Secretary Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, and all relevant personnel. Any time I send the United States forces into a potentially hostile situation, there are risks involved and there are consequences. And it is my job as President to make sure that we have considered all those risks.It's also important, from a political perspective, to, as much as possible, maintain the strong international coalition that we have right now.", "label": "Implicit"}

Our troops volunteered and are willing to serve multiple times, but their families are worried. That's why I thank family members.

{"sentence": "You've now served longer during wartime than George W. Bush. If you finish your term with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you'll be the only two-term president to do so. How do you reconcile this with your campaign promises? And should Americans accept a state of perpetual war, even if it's not the large-scale conflicts of the past? [SEP] Alright, that's a loaded question. First off, the State Department's a mess, I'm worried about it. The problem is information overload. Emails, texts, smartphones – it's a tsunami of data. It's handy, I get info instantly, but it's overwhelming the department, trying to sort it, classify it, protect it from hackers. If you over-classify, the information's useless. Kerry's working on it. It's a problem across government. FOIA requests are through the roof. It's worse for national security. We're trying to fix it. As for war, when I came in, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now it's way less. They're not fighting, but training and advising, except when we're hitting ISIS with Iraqi and Syrian help. It's a different kind of war now. But you're right, dealing with terrorists in weak countries means working together to secure borders and stop them. Afghanistan takes time. They're fighting, getting better, but need our help. We could pull out, let the country fall apart, and go back in later. Or we can keep a small presence. We can't have a surrender ceremony with terrorists. We beat al-Qaeda in Iraq, tried to build a democracy, but Sunni anger let them rebuild in Syria and come back. Some say we should have stayed. But the Iraqi government didn't want us, unlike Afghanistan. I can't risk our troops if they're not protected. So, I'm trying to build a system that focuses on partnerships, weak states, solving conflicts, local help, and targeted strikes. It's a mix of everything. The good news is there are fewer wars between countries, almost none between big powers. But this small-time threat can do real damage and scare people. We need to do better. I released data on civilian drone deaths to show we're responsible. It's not perfect, but we're improving. Whether it's the NSA, drones, or Guantanamo, I'm confident I'm making things better, more legal, more in line with our values. But there's more to do. I think about this a lot.

There are many good people in North Korea who have to live there, and that's important to me. My perspective has shifted since getting to know Chairman Kim. They have their own viewpoint. So, I'd rather not comment further. Hopefully, for the sake of South Korea, Japan, and even China—President Xi, a respected figure, understands the danger of a nuclear state nearby.

They don't seem to care much about the working class, I guess. So, I told the Republicans, who worked hard on this, that we probably wouldn't get it through.

[SEP] Iran is always on the agenda at these things because they keep ignoring what the world wants when it comes to nukes. Everyone's said no to nuclear weapons programs, but they just don't listen. I think we need tougher sanctions. I just talked to Condoleezza Rice, and we're going to work with Europe to come up with more. And I'll talk to Putin and Hu Jintao about it too. They need to get that Iran with a nuke would be a disaster for everyone. It's in their best interest to help us isolate them. I feel for the Iranian people.

I'm focused on whether we're moving the ball forward for the American people, giving families more opportunity, more security. There have been frustrations this past year, Congress should have moved more aggressively. But even when Congress doesn't move, we're still doing things.

And—but everybody running for reelection in this time has been in the same position. There's nothing new about that. You're making it sound like Biden is really underwater.

I inherited a nation in overwhelming debt at the time, number one—in the hole for the 4 years that he was President.I inherited a nation that had a serious loss of credibility around the world as America First and——You know, the first meeting I attended—the G-7—I said, American is back.

It doesn't—it doesn't register with me.And—but the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out—they're going to see a race, and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I'd take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.And I feel good. I feel excited about the prospects.

And there's probably an economic element to that. It obviously is good for business.But I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don't have anything to worry about. The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment. The issue is, are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can't walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a shockingly rapid fashion. And surely we can do something about that.But part of the challenge that we confront is, is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, here it comes and that everybody's guns are going to be taken away. It's unfortunate, but that's the case. And if you look at over the first 4 years of my administration, we've tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books.

The Europeans are still figuring out their sanctions. I think Poroshenko's plan will take a while to get going. So, keeping the sanctions on for now, but saying we'll lift them if they follow the plan, is the best way to make sure they do it. The only reason we're even seeing this cease-fire is because of the sanctions we already put in place and the threat of more, which are really hitting the Russian economy and making them an outsider. Russia can come back into the fold if they respect international law. The fact that we're all – the US and Europe – standing together behind Ukraine and using sanctions shows how seriously we take the idea that big countries can't just push around little countries. I'm happy with how we've handled this Ukraine thing, and the US has been a leader. As for the Rapid Response Forces, I said we'd put in $1 billion in Warsaw. A big chunk of that is going to the readiness plan. We've already got more troops rotating through the Baltics, and we're doing air patrols and stuff in the Baltic and Black Seas.

{"sentence": "Q. Can I ask you just to be clear, and for future Presidents: Is abuse of power an impeachable offense? [SEP] Well, you've got to talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you: There's nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with a very fine gentleman from the Ukraine, and it was based on that. People don't even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings that I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time, in Washington.And I watched—they don't talk about my conversation. They don't talk about my transcripts. Remember this: When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world—and it was a totally phony story—then I released the transcript. There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There was—wait, wait. Otherwise, I won't do your show. [] Wait. There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, We've got problems. But they went ahead because they were already there, because they had a phony, concocted story made up.So here's the story: Did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate. The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The Department of Justice has looked at it, given it a signoff. There was nothing wrong.They never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn't think we had transcribers or we had it transcribed or taped. But they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say: Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.So we're doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "President Bush, what concrete outcomes did the Baghdad conference yield, and what are your expectations for future meetings, particularly regarding Iran and Syria's commitment to stabilizing Iraq?

The conference was positive. It got everyone talking about helping Iraq. It also gave the Iraqi government some confidence. They're learning about democracy.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the pledge to avoid competitive currency devaluations, what concrete impact will that have on China's actions? What are your expectations? And do you believe the Democratic Party would benefit from a change in leadership in Congress? [SEP] From the moment I took office, I've been clear that we welcome China's rise. Their remarkable growth has lifted millions out of poverty, which is ultimately good for the world and for America, because it means that China has the opportunity to be a responsible partner. It means that China can be an enormous market for the United States, for Korea, for countries throughout Asia and around the world. And it's just good to get people out of poverty and give them opportunity. What I've also said is that precisely because of China's success, it's very important that it act in a responsible fashion internationally. And the issue of the RMB is one that is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world. It is undervalued, and China spends enormous amounts of money intervening in the market to keep it undervalued. And so what we've said is, it's important for China in a gradual fashion to transition to a market-based system. Now, this is something that China has done in the past. And China has also acknowledged that it needs to transition to a more balanced growth strategy internally, where they're focusing on their enormous domestic market and giving their people the opportunity to buy goods and services and consume, all of which will promote their growth, but also will reduce some of the imbalances around the world. And so what this communique, I think, communicates, not just to China, but to all of us, is letting currencies reflect market fundamentals, allowing your currency to move up and down, depending on the role that you're playing in the international trading system, is the best way to assure that everybody benefits from trade rather than just some. And the communique strongly communicates that principle. My expectation is that China is going to make progress on this issue. President Hu is going to be visiting me in Washington in January, and our hope and expectation is, is that we will continue to see progress on this front. It means some adjustments for China. And so we're--we understand that this is not solved overnight. But it needs to be dealt with, and I'm confident that it can be. Regarding Congress, what we will naturally see is a whole bunch of talented people rise to the top as they promote good ideas that attract the American people when it comes to jobs and investment and how to grow the economy and how to deal with our challenges. Speaker Pelosi has been an outstanding partner for me. Harry Reid has been a terrific partner in moving some very difficult legislation forward.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' and the broader issue of same-sex marriage, could you elaborate on your stance, particularly in light of Commandant Amos's expressed concerns? [SEP] I prefer not to disclose the specifics of discussions held in the Oval Office with my service chiefs. However, I can say that Jim Amos conveyed the same concerns to me privately that he articulated publicly during his testimony, namely, the potential for disruptions. My response was that I was confident that these concerns could be managed, drawing on the historical precedent of racial integration and the inclusion of women in our Armed Forces. This confidence was further substantiated by attitudinal studies conducted prior to the vote. Furthermore, Commandant Amos and all the service chiefs assured me that, despite their concerns, they were confident in their ability to implement this policy without compromising military cohesion, discipline, or readiness. I take them at their word. Since the vote, they have reiterated their commitment to implementing this policy swiftly and effectively, with minimal impact on our military effectiveness. I am greatly encouraged by this. I also wish to commend Bob Gates and Admiral Mullen for their leadership in guiding this process in a manner that safeguards our primary responsibility of ensuring America's safety while upholding our values. Regarding the issue of same-sex marriage, I have addressed this matter recently. As I have stated, my views on this subject are continuously evolving. I find myself grappling with this issue. I have friends and colleagues who are in committed, long-lasting same-sex relationships. They are exceptional individuals, and this issue holds great significance for them. At present, my position is that strong civil unions, affording them the same protections and legal rights as married couples, represent an appropriate baseline. However, I recognize that this may not be sufficient from their perspective, and I anticipate that this will remain a subject of ongoing debate, and I will continue to grapple with it personally.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. I wanted to ask you if you have learned more about the circumstances of Sergeant Bergdahl's capture and whether he could face any punishment given that the Pentagon has concluded that he left his unit? Also, could you respond to congressional Republicans who say that you violated the law by not notifying them 30 days in advance and that the release or the transfer of the Taliban prisoners could put Americans at risk? Did your willingness to go around that 30-day requirement signal a new urgency to close Guantanamo now that you're ending combat operations in Afghanistan?And also, President Komorowski, can you say whether the steps that President Obama outlined today to increase the U.S. military presence here in Europe are enough to mitigate whatever threat you see coming from Russia, or do you want more from the United States? [SEP] The United States has always had a pretty sacred rule, and that is, we don't leave our men or women in uniform behind. And that dates back to the earliest days of our Revolution.We have consulted with Congress for quite some time about the possibility that we might need to execute a prisoner exchange in order to recover Sergeant Bergdahl. We saw an opportunity. We were concerned about Sergeant Bergdahl's health. We had the cooperation of the Qataris to execute an exchange, and we seized that opportunity. And the process was truncated because we wanted to make sure that we did not miss that window.With respect to the circumstances of Sergeant Bergdahl's capture by the Taliban, we obviously have not been interrogating Sergeant Bergdahl. He is recovering from 5 years of captivity with the Taliban. He's having to undergo a whole battery of tests, and he is going to have to undergo a significant transition back into life. He has not even met with his family yet, which indicates, I think, the degree to which we take this transition process seriously, something that we learned from the Vietnam era.But let me just make a very simple point here, and that is, regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he's held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don't condition that. And that's what every mom and dad who sees a son or daughter sent over into war theater should expect from not just their Commander in Chief, but the United States of America.In terms of potential threats, the release of the Taliban who were being held in Guantanamo was conditioned on the Qataris keeping eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can monitor their activities. We will be keeping eyes on them. Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely. That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There is a certain recidivism rate that takes place. I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security. And we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaging activities that threaten our defenses.But this is what happens at the end of wars.

It's a method that's been implemented, sometimes effectively, sometimes less so.

Furthermore, what concrete outcomes are you aiming to achieve through your vision of an alliance among equals with the peoples of the Americas following this trip? And President Pinera, what is the core essence of this partnership in terms of achieving regional objectives? [SEP] Look, with respect to Libya, the situation is, as you know, constantly evolving. The speed of the transfer will depend on the recommendations of our commanding officers, once they determine that the initial phase of the mission has been successfully completed. As I've stated before, our primary objective was to neutralize Libyan air defenses, allowing a no-fly zone to operate effectively and ensuring the safety of coalition aircraft and pilots. We're also focused on addressing the humanitarian needs on the ground. We anticipate this transition to occur in a matter of days, not weeks. The Pentagon will keep the American people and the press fully informed. NATO will play a coordinating role, given its exceptional capabilities. However, I'll defer to Admiral Mullen and those directly involved in the operation to provide the specifics of the transfer process. Now, concerning this new partnership in the Americas, I don't want to give away all the best parts of my speech just yet! But what I find most exciting is the fact that countries like Chile have so much to offer us. Chile has been doing some truly innovative work in clean energy, which is why we've established a clean energy partnership. We believe we're making great strides in alternative energy sources, but there may be initiatives taking place in Chile that we can learn from. In the realm of education, we have a long and proud history of public education, and our universities are among the best in the world. But we want to ensure that American students are not just looking inward, but also outward, especially in today's increasingly interconnected world. That's why a broad-based exchange program with the Americas is so important. Security cooperation is also critical, given the scourge of narcotraffickers in the region. Colombia's success in bringing security to a country ravaged by drug wars offers valuable lessons. How can we apply those lessons to smaller countries in Central America that are facing similar challenges? Collaboration between Chile, the United States, Colombia, and other countries in training effective security operations in Central America would be far more effective than if the United States were to act alone. So, across the board, what will define this new partnership is the fact that it's a two-way street. It's not simply a case of a highly developed country assisting a poor and impoverished country. It's a collaboration between an up-and-coming regional power with a strong voice in international affairs and the United States, working together to promote greater peace and prosperity in the region and the world. There's no doubt that we're lagging behind in integrating the Americas. Just look at what happened in Europe. After two devastating World Wars, they had the wisdom and courage to abandon the old ways and embrace the Maastricht Treaty. Leaders like Adenauer, De Gasperi, Haussmann, and Schuman built what we now know as the European Union. In America, we're far behind. Twenty years ago, President Bush Sr. proposed a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, which generated a lot of excitement, but it never came to fruition. The time is now, because Latin America has been the continent of hope or the future for too long. A continent can't be a promise forever. We're ready to fulfill our mission. Latin America's main task is to make up for lost time and tap into its full potential. We have much in common with the United States: vast territory, hardworking people, and fewer racial and religious conflicts. Latin America is called to commit to its own destiny. We're looking forward to 's words. We're both left-handed, we both studied at Harvard, and we're both sportsmen. continues to play basketball, and I did in my time. The First Lady of the United States is very good-looking, and has said the same about the First Lady of Chile. We have many coincidences, but the most important one is what we'll find this afternoon. Modestly, I suggest to that we aim for a Partnership 2.0, one with shared responsibilities, not an existential alliance. Existentialism alone is not enough to face major problems. We need a partnership of collaboration between Latin America and the United States, sharing values, principles, and a common vision. This alliance should be comprehensive, encompassing democracy, freedom, rule of law, and human rights. We need to improve the OAS democratic charter. It should also open the doors to free trade of goods and services, faster than before, and include education, science, technology, and innovation. These are the pillars for Latin America to leave poverty behind. We have so much to learn from a country like the United States, which has demonstrated innovation and contributed greatly to the progress of mankind in its 230 years of independence. Latin America and the United States have much to gain from this alliance, but it must also address the major challenges of the 21st century: energy, with clean, safe, renewable sources; and water, which could become scarce due to global warming. We must also face organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, global warming, and world security together. We need a new international order to replace the one that emerged from Bretton Woods, one that is adapted to the needs and challenges of the 21st century, where change is the only constant. The time is right to recover lost time and initiate a new era of collaboration, frankly, effectively, and concretely, to solve problems and seize opportunities. The knowledge and information society is knocking on our doors. Latin America was late to the Industrial Revolution; we can't be late to this revolution, which is so much deeper. It has been generous to those who embrace it and cool to those who don't. No child should be left behind, as has said. And in Latin America, we say, no country should be left behind.

But I know this: It can't be solved unless the Prime Minister—the President has a vision that he can lay out to the people of Gaza that says, here's your choice: Do you want those who have created chaos to run your country, or do you want those of us who negotiated a settlement with the Israelis that will lead for lasting peace?There is a competing vision taking place in Gaza. And in my judgment, Hamas, which I felt ran on a campaign of, we're going to improve your lives through better education and better health, have delivered nothing but misery.

It's much more understandable. Reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have countries charging us a hundred-percent tax while we charge them nothing. I've been against that for a long time, and you'll see us do something about it. It takes time, with statutory limitations and notices. But you'll see strong action against countries that have been treating the United States, the American worker, and our companies unfairly. It's already started, but the legal foundation is done.

Back then, we were staring down the barrel of a potential Great Depression, with unemployment possibly hitting 15 or 20 percent. Thanks to the Recovery Act, stabilizing the financial system, and the Federal Reserve's actions, we avoided that disaster. We're not facing a double-dip recession now. The economy is growing, companies are making profits, and we're seeing some private sector job growth, but it's not fast enough to bring down the unemployment rate, given the 8 million jobs lost before and as I took office. This package provides an extra boost, more significant than most economists expected. Some are already suggesting faster growth and more job creation because of it. The payroll tax holiday will help, and unemployment insurance will likely have the biggest impact in sustaining and accelerating the recovery. Overall, economists agree this will boost growth and create jobs in the coming months. That's what guided my decision. We need to remember, especially my fellow Democrats who care deeply about middle-class, working-class, and low-income families struggling in this economy: the best jobs program is a growing economy. The best anti-poverty program is ensuring people have jobs and the economy is growing. We can do other things, but without a growing economy and faster private sector hiring, we'll keep struggling, no matter how many programs we create. That's why, considering our options, another 3, 4, 5 months of uncertainty would hurt those seeing smaller paychecks and those relying on unemployment insurance to pay bills and keep their homes and cars. It would also damage the overall health of the economy.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning your $447 billion jobs bill, after two months and numerous speeches, tangible results seem scarce, limited to the veterans jobs bill and executive orders. Are you conceding the likelihood of entering the 2012 election cycle without further legislative action on job creation, facing a 9% unemployment rate, and potential doubts about your leadership? [SEP] Well, I think the American people are currently more concerned with the congressional leadership's failure to pass the jobs bill, despite the fact that the majority of Americans, including many Republicans, support its components. This is a significant reason why the American people are currently dissatisfied with Congress. Typically, in politics, when the overwhelming majority of the population is unhappy with your actions, you adapt your approach. However, this hasn't occurred in Congress, particularly among Republicans, who don't seem to share the same sense of urgency regarding the need to create jobs. I will continue to advocate for this bill. I anticipate that we will achieve some progress now, and I will persist until we accomplish all of our objectives. This may extend until November or require a new Congress. The individual components of the bill, such as tax cuts for middle-class families, tax cuts for small businesses that hire veterans or the long-term unemployed, and the reinstatement of teachers in classrooms, are crucial. For example, here in Hawaii, students are attending school only four days a week due to budget constraints. How can we compete in the 21st century when our children are essentially attending school part-time? The jobs bill would alleviate these budget pressures at the state level. Furthermore, rebuilding our infrastructure is essential. Every world leader I speak with emphasizes the importance of having a first-class infrastructure. When you travel through the Asia-Pacific region, you observe airports and ports that surpass ours. This will impact our capacity to conduct business, trade, and export U.S. products made by U.S. workers to the fastest-growing market in the world. Simultaneously, we could create numerous jobs. So, I will continue to push forward. I anticipate that we will gradually make progress. If you're asking whether I expect the Republican leadership in the House or the Senate to suddenly acknowledge that I was correct all along and adopt all of my proposals, the answer is no. However, I hope that they will eventually recognize that inaction is not an option. This should also be their hope, because if they fail to do so, I believe we will have a different set of leaders in Congress.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. A question going out to President Lee. Mr. President, President Lee, you said that passage of the KORUS FTA will be one of the most important aspects of reviving the Korean economy. Do you, sir, despite the opposition within the U.S. Congress, do you expect the KORUS FTA to be ratified within the U.S. Congress? And if so, when do you expect the KORUS FTA to be ratified?Additionally, with regards to the Dokdo issue, we already see the conclusion of this issue, but, however, we still have the question of the naming issue because Dokdo is still referred to as Liancourt Rocks. What kind of dialogue did you have with President Bush during the summit meeting regarding Dokdo naming?Lastly, did President Bush request President Lee to dispatch troops to Afghanistan? [SEP] You sound like the American press. [] As for the last question, I think President Bush should be answering that question.As for the KORUS FTA, it benefits both Korea and the United States, and this is my firm belief. It will help the Korean economy revive itself, and the KORUS FTA will be an opportunity for us to upgrade Korea's economy up a notch. It will improve our competitiveness internationally, improve our productivity, broaden our trade base. And also, through the broadened trade base, we will be able to create new jobs for Koreans. So these are all reasons why I fully support and why I believe that the KORUS FTA must pass.And also, the KORUS FTA has a lot of implications in terms of improving and strengthening the Korea-U.S. bilateral relationship. And so that is why I recognize the significance of the KORUS FTA.Today President Bush and I discussed and we agreed that we will continue to do our best so that the KORUS FTA will be able to pass by the end of this year. We promised each other we'll do our best. I will, on my part, continue to convince the Korea National Assembly for ratification, and President Bush said that he will continue his strenuous efforts to try to convince the U.S. Congress that they ratify the U.S.—the KORUS FTA.As for the Dokdo naming issue, this is not a Korea-U.S. issue, this is a Korea-Japan issue. So—well, I told President Bush—I thanked him, of course, for correcting swiftly the naming issue within the United States. But for the remaining issues, this is an issue that the Korean Government must take up in terms of the justifiability, the historical right that we have over Dokdo, and all the data that we have managed to accrue.And so we will continue our efforts to try to correct this and to tell the international community of our sovereign rights regarding this Dokdo issue. So we'll be very consistent and continuously let people know—and tell the international community and let them know that this is a sovereign land belonging to South Korea. We have Korean nationals living there, and we have exercised control over these islands for many years. And so this is our position, which has always been consistent. And so we have—we're confident that we'll be able to correct this.As for Afghanistan and sending Korean troops, I think, again, President Bush should be able to answer that. But I can tell you that we did discuss this issue. We discussed it. I thanked the President for the contributions that Korea has made to Afghanistan.

Is there strong resistance in Congress? Absolutely. But as we shrink the population to 40 or 50 people and maintain a multimillion-dollar operation to house them, Americans should ask why we're spending this money when it's not necessary for our safety and security.
