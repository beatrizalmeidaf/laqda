{"sentence": "Q. I'm fine. Back on the economy, Mr. President, people are criticizing this road to recovery plan. Specifically, there were reports in the Washington Post that say that the African America unemployment rate will go to 20 percent by the end of this year. And then you had your Chairman of Economic Advisers say the target intervention may come next year if nothing changes. Why not target intervention now to stop the bloodletting in the black unemployment rate? [SEP] Well, look, the--first of all, we know that when--the African American unemployment rate, the Latino unemployment rate, are consistently higher than the national average. And so if the economy as a whole is doing poorly, then you know that the African American community is going to be doing poorly, and they're going to be hit even harder. And the best thing that I can do for the African American community or the Latino community or the Asian community, whatever community, is to get the economy as a whole moving. If I don't--hold on one second; let me answer the question--if I don't do that, then I'm not going to be able to help anybody. So that's priority number one.It is true that in certain inner-city communities, the unemployment rate is--was already sky high even before this recession. The ladders available for people to enter into the job market are even worse. And so we are interested in looking at proven programs that help people on a pathway to jobs.There was a reason why right before Father's Day I went to a program here locally in Washington called Year Up, which has a proven track record of taking young, mostly minority people, some of whom have graduated from high school, some maybe who've just gotten their GED, and trained them on computers and provide them other technical skills, but also train them on how to carry themselves in an office, how to write an e-mail--some of the social skills that will allow them to be more employable. They've got a terrific placement rate after this 1-year program. If there are ways that we can potentially duplicate some of those programs, then we're going to do so.So part of what we want to do is to find tools that will give people more opportunity. But the most important thing I can do is to lift the economy overall, and that's what my strategy is focused on.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the hundreds of billions already spent and the continued economic downturn, what specific benchmarks should the American people use to assess the effectiveness of your programs? Should they be tracking the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment rates, or some other indicator? What's the key metric, and when can we expect to see concrete results, or will a Plan B be necessary? [SEP] The most crucial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's the bottom line, because when people are employed, they have the confidence to spend and invest. Businesses see that increased consumer confidence and start investing and hiring. So, job creation is the first priority. Second, are the credit markets operating effectively? I constantly hear from successful businesses that can't get credit. For instance, in Elkhart, the RV capital, customers want to buy RVs but can't get loans, even with good credit. And businesses can't get loans to pay their suppliers. So, normalizing the credit markets is essential. Third, housing: have we stabilized the market? The Federal Government doesn't have complete control, but our plan, working with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, aims to slow foreclosures and stabilize housing values. The biggest success indicator is whether we stop contracting and losing jobs, and start growing again. I don't have a crystal ball, and this is an unprecedented crisis.

I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. However, I am prepared to speak with him if he demonstrates a genuine interest in finding a way to end the war, in consultation with our allies. Regarding President Zelenskyy's conditions, it's crucial to remember that Ukraine is defending itself against aggression and has presented a 10-point peace plan.

[SEP] Iran is constantly on our minds, as you know, because they continue to defy the will of the international community. The world has spoken: no nuclear weapons. Yet they persist. We must strengthen our sanctions regime. I just spoke with Condoleezza Rice, and we are collaborating with our European partners to develop further sanctions. I will also be discussing this matter with Vladimir Putin and President Hu Jintao. These leaders must grasp that a nuclear-armed Iran would be incredibly destabilizing for the entire world. It is in their own self-interest to work with us to continue isolating that regime. I have great sympathy for the people of Iran. They are suffering under a government that insists on pursuing a program that the world has condemned, thereby depriving them of the economic opportunities they deserve. Iran is a nation with a proud tradition and a rich history, filled with hardworking individuals who yearn for a more open society. Yet, their government persists in measures that will only lead to further isolation. Therefore, to answer your question, we will continue to exert pressure.

{"sentence": "Q. Good afternoon. I'm from Korea Herald. My name is Lee Ji-yoon. The Korean people are very curious about vaccines, and they're waiting for the good news regarding vaccine. I understand that you've had a lot of discussions with President Biden regarding vaccine, and I wonder whether you have any good news to deliver to the people of Korea. And has there been any meaningful achievement that you want to go into the details of? [SEP] Yes. Regarding vaccine cooperation, you can read the joint statements and also the remarks that were issued as press release today. But, to emphasize it once again, between the U.S. and Korea for vaccine cooperation, there will be a comprehensive partnership to be established between our two nations, and there has been an agreement between our two sides on that.The U.S. has the ability to develop vaccines, and Korean companies have the capacity to produce a biomedicine. And we are going to combine those capabilities so that we can boost vaccine supply, so that we can accelerate the rollout of vaccines to the entire world, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. For supplying vaccines to that region, I believe that we'll be able to make a contribution in that regard.And in that process, Korea, in my opinion, will get some help in stabilizing our vaccine supply. And at the same time, for the sake of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, President Biden decided to provide vaccines to the servicemen in Korea as soon as the U.S. is ready. I understand there will be an announcement to be made by the U.S. side. By the way, I can just prematurely make that. And we're going—there are 550,000 Korean soldiers, sailors, airmen who work in close contact with American forces in Korea. We'll provide full vaccinations for all 550,000 of those Korean forces engaging with American forces on a regular basis, both for their sake, as well as the sake of the American forces.In addition to that, we've talked about the ability to have vaccines produced with our—working with—and this is in the offing—working with one of the major vaccine producers in the United States and to—where Korea is incredibly sophisticated. And with the help of that particular company, we'll be able to make significant numbers of vaccines for themselves.And lastly, it is my hope and expectation—I cannot commit to it because we don't know for certain—but we think that, over the remainder of 2021, we're going to be able to vaccinate every American. We have enough vaccine to vaccinate every American, period, right now. And we're going to be able to do that by the mid-summer, and we're going to continue to get more people to engage in seeking the vaccine. I don't believe—I never have believed—that there's a large percentage of Americans who will not take the vaccine. And we're doing very imaginative things, and the States are, to get people to show up and have the vaccine.But we believe—we believe—that, between the second half of 2021 and going in through 2022, we can produce as many as another billion doses of vaccine. Because it's not just—and this is what I like about this President—he's not just talking about it, any more than I'm just talking about the United States or just Korea; he's talking about the Indo-Pacific. He's talking about the world.We, with advanced capabilities, have an obligation to do everything we can to provide for protection of the entire world. I know that is an awfully, awfully, awfully ambitious proposal, but I think the nations that have that capacity are going to be continuing to work toward getting that done.And so thank you.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. What would be your advice to Democrats who might see that kind of strategy as the same kind of path to taking back power that the Republicans employed? And related to that, what would your advice be to House Democrats about whether or not to reelect Nancy Pelosi as the party leader in the House? [SEP] Well, I'll work in reverse. I think Nancy Pelosi is an outstanding and historic political leader. So much of what we accomplished was accomplished because of her smarts, her tenacity, her legislative skill. And I don't normally meddle with party votes, and certainly on my way out the door, probably, I shouldn't meddle here. But I cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi. She combines strong, progressive values with just extraordinary political skill. And she does stuff that's tough, not just stuff that's easy. She's done stuff that's unpopular in her own base because it's the right thing to do for the American people. I think she's a remarkable leader.With respect to Democrats and Republicans and how Democrats should deal with a new administration, I think you give them a hearing. I certainly don't want them to do what Mitch McConnell did when I was elected: meet the day of and say our sole objective is to not cooperate with him on anything even if the country is about to go into a depression so that we can gain seats in the midterms and ultimately defeat him.That's not why the American people send us to Washington, to play those games. So that's not my advice to Democrats. My advice to Democrats is, know what you care about and what you stand for, and fight for your principles even if it's a hard fight. If there are areas where the new administration is doing something that's going to be good for the American people, find a way to work with them. If you think it's going to be a problem, then say so and make the argument.The touchstone is, what's good for the American people. And that's worked for me. It means that at the end of the day—and at the end of 8 years—I can look back, and I can say that I consistently did what I thought was best. It doesn't mean you don't make mistakes, but it means that you're being true to your oath and the commitments you made to the people who elected you. And in terms of reflecting on the U.S. Presidency as I've been traveling, I think the main reflection I have and the main advice that I give to the incoming President is, the United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order. And I say that as somebody who has gone out of his way to express respect for every country and its people and to consistently acknowledge that many of the challenges that we face are not challenges that America can solve on its own. But what I also know is that the basic framework of the world order coming out of World War II and then on through the end of the cold war was shaped by a set of ideals and principles that have worked for the vast majority of people, not just America, but around the world. The notion of democracy and rule of law and a free press and an independent judiciary and open markets and a social welfare state to moderate some off the sharp edges of capitalism and lifting up issues of human rights and investing in public health and development—not just within our own borders, but elsewhere in the world—and working with multilateral institutions like the United Nations, making sure that we're upholding international norms and rules.That's what's made the modern world. And there have been times where we, ourselves, have not observed some of these norms as well as we should and have been accused of hypocrisy. Here in Latin America, there have been times where countries felt disrespected and, on occasion, had cause for that. There are times where we haven't observed these values in our own country and have fallen short of our ideals. But that basic structure is the reason why the world is much wealthier, much more secure, and, yes, less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant than it was 50 years ago.And that requires constant work. It doesn't just happen on its own. I've said this in Europe. I've said this in places where there's this pushback against this modern order. But you take an example like Europe, before that order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of 30 years. In the second one, 60 million people were killed. Not half a million, not a million, but 60 million. Entire continents in rubble.In places like Asia—the Asia-Pacific, before that order existed, you routinely saw famines of millions of people, not just concerns about low wages, but people dying because they didn't have any food or drinking water or died of cholera or simple diseases—if somebody had some penicillin.And so what I would say would be that we all share responsibilities for improving that order and maintaining it and making sure it's more inclusive and delivers greater hope and prosperity for more corners of the world. We all have responsibilities—every nation—in respecting the dignity and worth of their citizens. And America can't do it all for everybody else. There are limits to our reach into other countries if they're determined to oppress their people or not provide girls education or siphon off development funds into Swiss bank accounts because they're corrupt. We're not going to be able to handle every problem.But the American President and the United States of America—if we're not on the side of what's right, if we're not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we're not able to deliver it a hundred percent everywhere—then it collapses. And there's nobody to fill the void. There really isn't. There are other very important countries, like a China, where we can't—if it weren't for China's cooperation, we couldn't have gotten the Paris Agreement done. But China is not the one who was going around organizing 200 nations to sign on to a Paris Agreement or putting together the paper and the policy outlines and the conceptual framework. Russia is a very significant military power, but they're not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti. We are.And I've said before, that's a burden that we should carry proudly. And I would hope that not just the 45th President of the United States, but every President of the United States understands that that's not only a burden, but it's also an extraordinary privilege. And if you have a chance to do that right, then you should seize it.All right? Thank you, everybody.", "label": "Explicit"}

Their concern is whether it will continue. My successor should sustain this engagement, given the dynamic populations and growing economies here. As for Guantanamo, I won't concede it will remain open. We're shrinking the population. It's a recruitment tool for terrorists, hinders counterterrorism cooperation, and is unnecessary and expensive.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in his final address, Tony Blair expressed contrition regarding Iraq, stating he acted in accordance with his convictions but apologized if he erred. Do you harbor similar sentiments of reflection? Would a greater emphasis on Afghanistan have been warranted? Prime Minister, is the Lisbon Treaty now defunct, and what strategic course will Europe pursue moving forward? [SEP] The annals of history will ultimately render judgment upon the tactics employed, the deployment of troops, and their strategic positioning. The removal of Saddam Hussein was a righteous act, undertaken for the sake of our national security, the pursuit of peace, and the betterment of the Iraqi people. The paramount objective now is to assist Iraq in establishing a democratic system, not a mere replica of the United States, but a government that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of its citizenry. Was this endeavor worthwhile? Absolutely, given that we are engaged in an ideological conflict, with Afghanistan and Iraq serving as the primary theaters of engagement. A free and democratic Iraq will facilitate our dealings with Iran and serve as an inspiration to reformers and dissidents throughout the Middle East. The Western world must choose between prioritizing freedom and merely maintaining stability. The situation in Zimbabwe demonstrates the importance of the form of government. Freedom has had a transformative effect on Europe and the Far East. Will we allow it to have a similar impact on the Middle East? Some question the universality of freedom, suggesting that only Western societies are capable of self-governance. I reject this notion as a form of elitism. History demonstrates that freedom is a prerequisite for peace, unless we retreat into isolationism, lose our confidence, or abandon our efforts. I remain steadfast in my conviction that the removal of Saddam Hussein was the correct decision. The desire for freedom is a universal human value, and Iraq is a democracy today because of the actions we have taken.

{"sentence": "Q. The common denominator in the strife in Ukraine and Syria is the support that those two governments get from Russia, and I'm wondering, sir, if you believe that President Putin bears some responsibility for the intransigence of those two regimes. And to some degree, has this gone beyond just those two countries, and has it become a tug of war between two world powers? [SEP] Let me answer very briefly on the trade issue It's not accurate, Jim, to say that my party opposes this trade deal There are elements in my party that opposes this trade deal, there are elements in my party that opposed the South Korea free trade agreement, the Colombia free trade agreement, and the Panama free trade agreement, all of which we passed with Democratic votesSo what I've said to President Peña Nieto and Prime Minister Harper is, we'll get this passed if it's a good agreement And the key at this point is to make sure that our countries, which hold ourselves up as champions of free trade, resolve our legitimate national interests in these negotiations so that we can present a united front against a number of the other participants in the TPP negotiations who don't have as much of a tradition of free trade And that is to our advantage, precisely because North America has this amazing competitive advantage and we are already relatively open marketsAnd part of our goal here is to make sure that the Asia-Pacific region—which is growing faster than anyplace else in the world, has a larger population than anyplace else in the world—that they have a model of trade that is free and fair and open and allows our businesses to compete and allows our workers to make goods and deliver services that those markets are purchasing And we can only do that if we raise the bar in terms of what our trade models look likeAnd I've said this to some of my own constituents who are opposed to trade: that those who are concerned about losing jobs or outsourcing need to understand, some of the old agreements put us at a disadvantage That's exactly why we've got to have stronger agreements that protect our intellectual property, that open up markets to our agricultural products, that make sure that when it comes to government procurement or sovereign wealth funds in these other countries, that they're not taking advantage of our businesses and preventing us from competing there That's exactly why we've got to get this done And I'm very appreciative of the shared vision and commitment that Prime Minister Harper and President Enrique Peña Nieto have on this issueNow, with respect to Syria and the Ukraine, I do think it is worth noting that you have in this situation one country that has clearly been a client state of Russia, another whose Government is currently—been supported by Russia, where the people obviously have a very different view and vision for their country And we've now seen a great deal of turmoil there that arose organically from within those countriesI don't think there's a competition between the United States and Russia I think this is an expression of the hopes and aspirations of people inside of Syria and people inside of the Ukraine who recognize that basic freedoms—freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, fair and free elections, the ability to run a business without paying a bribe, to not be discriminated against because of your religion or your beliefs—that those are fundamental rights that everybody wants to enjoyNow, Mr Putin has a different view on many of those issues, and I don't think that there's any secret on that And our approach as the United States is not to see these as some Cold War chessboard in which we're in competition with Russia Our goal is to make sure that the people of Ukraine are able to make decisions for themselves about their future, that the people of Syria are able to make decisions without having bombs going off and killing women and children, or chemical weapons, or towns being starved because a despot wants to cling to powerThose express our values and our national interests, and we will continue to express those national interests There are times, I hope, where Russia will recognize that over the long term they should be on board with those values and interests as well Right now there are times where we have strong disagreements And when I speak to Mr Putin, I'm very candid about those disagreements, even as we will continue to pursue cooperation with Russia on areas where we have shared concernsBut I want to emphasize this: The situation that happened in Ukraine has to do with whether or not the people of Ukraine can determine their own destiny And my Government and Vice President Biden, and I personally, have expressed to President Yanukovych the need for him to recognize the spirit of the Ukrainian people and work with that, as opposed to trying to repress it And so we'll continue to stand on the side of the peopleMy hope is, at this point, that a truce may hold, but Stephen's exactly right Ultimately, the Government is responsible for making sure that we shift towards some sort of unity government, even if it's temporary, that allows us to move to fair and free elections so that the will of the Ukrainian people can be rightly expressed without the kinds of chaos we've seen on the streets and without the bloodshed that all of us, I think, strongly condemnPrime Minister Harper I'll just—on the issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as I said, we are wanting to see and committed to seeing a good, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement I think it's in all of our interests for the reasons that have already been laid out That said, the Government of Canada's position is always clear in these matters that we will only come to an agreement when we are convinced the agreement is in the best interest of Canada And we will stay at the table as long as it takes to get to that particular situationAnd I think we have the track record to prove it Our Government, the current Government of Canada, has signed more trade agreements than all previous Canadian governments combined What I would say is this—I'm not going to comment on the process in Congress What I would say is this: The reason I said what I said about working until we get an agreement that is in the interest of Canada is we will have to have an agreement that can be sold to the Canadian Parliament and ultimately to the Canadian people And that's what we're aiming for[]I repeat: In regard to the Trans-Pacific agreement—alliance and in regard to our relations with the Asia-Pacific region, we have our own perspective And we will negotiate up to the point where we will have an agreement on the table And we need to show that our administration has subscribed more agreements than any other previous administrations And so for the Canadian Government, it is essential to note that we can submit these proposals to the Canadian Parliament and of the line—[inaudible] President Peña Nieto The Mexican stand has been very clear, and specifically, our take on the TPP, we have always stated it: It is of the interest of Mexico We have been part of the negotiation rounds to eventually reach an agreement of this important opportunity that the TPP offers We can expand the potential of North America into the Asia-Pacific region Mexico would do its best for the sake of Mexico to be on the side of the solution, overcome disagreements and eventual roadblocks that the negotiation rounds present And we hope that it is this spirit that we reach the agreementMexico has made a commitment and has shown political will to be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership We hope that the deal happens That is the Mexican stand, and we will work to the best of our ability to reach this goalNow, on behalf of Mexico, Miguel Reyes Razo, from the Mexican Editorial Organization, will ask a question", "label": "Implicit"}

There's a lot of things that Ukraine wants we didn't do.For example, I was asked very much whether we we'd provide American aircraft to guarantee the skies over Ukraine. I said: No, we're not going to do that. We're not going to get into a third world war, taking on Russian aircraft and directly engage. But would we provide them with all—the rational ability to defend themselves? Yes.We provide those HIMARS. Well, the HIMARS—there's two kinds of, in the average person's parlance, rockets you can drop in those: one that goes over 600 miles and one that goes, oh, about 160 miles. We didn't give them any ones that go to 600 miles, because I'm not looking for them to start bombing Russian territory.And so we want to make sure that there's a relationship that they're able to defend themselves and take on what is purely a—the ugliest aggression that's occurred since World War II on a massive scale, on the part of Putin, within Ukraine.

[SEP] Well, in regards to the refugee crisis, let's not forget the impact of the Paris attacks. People are understandably worried, and that's influenced policy. But we need to remember the intense vetting process refugees go through, lasting almost two years. The House bill, while seemingly simple, could cripple the refugee program, hurting those who need help most. My 'values' comment was about the idea of religious preference or fearing innocent children. On Prime Minister Najib, I don't usually comment on investigations, especially abroad. But I did stress the need for transparency, accountability, and fighting corruption, which are key to development. I also highlighted the importance of civil society and a free press. Countries evolve at different rates, but these principles are crucial. Myanmar's elections are a good sign, and we want to support progress through initiatives like the Open Government Partnership and TPP.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the historical lack of progress on immigration reform, what factors lead you to believe that Mexicans might now find reason to trust in its potential realization? Furthermore, what is your assessment of the likelihood of this legislative initiative successfully navigating the Congressional process? [SEP] The question of timing is pertinent. Legislative processes in the United States are often protracted. Meaningful discourse on migration has only recently commenced. My tenure as Governor of Texas instilled in me a profound understanding of the issue's importance. Public concern regarding the enforcement of existing laws was palpable. We have, I believe, demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, thereby fostering a more receptive environment in Congress for comprehensive reform. Such reform would serve to mitigate illegal border crossings and facilitate a more focused allocation of resources towards combating drugs, terrorism, and criminal activity. I am cautiously optimistic, as evidenced by the bipartisan collaboration currently underway. The administration is actively engaged in facilitating consensus. While I eschew prognostication, I remain hopeful that comprehensive reform can be achieved, as it is manifestly in the interests of both nations.", "label": "Implicit"}

What did Canada concede to the U.S. in this arrangement? [SEP] As the Prime Minister articulated, a simple closure of Roxham Road would have been counterproductive. It would have simply pushed migrants to more dangerous and uncontrolled crossings. The modernization of the Safe Third Country Agreement addresses this by ensuring consistent treatment for all asylum seekers. This required a complex and deliberate process.

That's why our numbers are lower than they would have been. It was a tough, unprecedented decision. My next priority is getting the best people.

The jobs plan includes an extension of the payroll tax cut.Now, if that is not extended, then that is over $1,000 out of the pockets of the average American family at a time when they're already feeling a severe pinch.

Unlike Iraq, where we've seen progress, Afghanistan's government is struggling, and the Taliban and Al Qaida persist. We need a coordinated effort to eliminate their safe havens. General Petraeus and Special Envoy Holbrooke are assessing the situation and developing a regional strategy. We must coordinate our military, diplomatic, and development efforts with our allies.

There's always going to be noise in their system and ours. The truth will prevail. For example, you read stories that the U.S. is planning permanent bases in Iraq. That's false. The Iraqis know it's false. We're there at the invitation of the sovereign Government of Iraq. The agreement sends a clear message to the people of Iraq that the security they're seeing will continue. Democracy and economic development require security.

First of all, we've grown the economy by a million jobs over the last year. So that's pretty noticeable. I think those million people who've been hired notice those paychecks. And that's 10 consecutive months of private sector job growth.In order to speed up job growth, we've put forward a range of proposals that I hope to discuss with Democratic and Republican leaders, because I don't think we can just stand pat. I continue to believe that we need to invest in a creaky infrastructure back home. And I think as you travel around Asia, you start seeing other countries investing in infrastructure. That's what the United States has done in the past, but we've been living off the investments that we made back in the thirties, forties, fifties, and sixties. And it's time for us to make sure that we've upgraded our roads and our railways and our airports. That will make us more productive and will put people back to work right now.I continue to believe that it is important for us to work with businesses to see if we can incentivize them to invest now rather than holding cash waiting for the future. They've got cash to spend. And so we've put forward a series of tax proposals that historically Republicans have supported. And my expectation would be, there's no reason for them not to support it just because I'm supporting it. And so that's a conversation that I hope to have next week.But we have a recovery. It needs to be speeded up. Government can't hire back the 8 million people who lost their jobs. Ultimately, that's up to the private sector.

We've delivered a clear message that meddling with elections or targeting private organizations is unacceptable, and we'll respond appropriately. We need international frameworks to prevent a cyber arms race. We've started working on principles at the G-20, G-7, and U.N. levels, but more work is needed. The transition period in the United States is proceeding smoothly, with the outgoing administration sharing its knowledge with the incoming one. This encourages us to continue the good cooperation between the United States and Germany. I'll approach this with an open mind and a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump. On Russia, it's about respecting certain principles. From a European perspective, peace depends on respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty. The reverse would be a dangerous path. We're pinning our hopes on political efforts like the Normandy process. Russia is our neighbor, and we have an interest in a good relationship. We must raise our differences with political means and work for political settlements. I'll continue to work on this with all my heart. I'll decide on my candidacy at the appropriate time.", "label": "General"}

Secretary Gates, staying on as Secretary of Defense, signals continuity to Afghanistan. We'll likely see more U.S. troops where the Taliban is causing trouble. I recall discussing this with Presidents Karzai and Musharraf – the threat of extremists using violence for political goals is a problem for all of us. A collaborative strategy is essential, working with Pakistan to address those who harm their citizens and Afghans.

Your administration simultaneously prevented California from enforcing its own stricter emission standards. Could you please clarify how important fighting greenhouse gases is to you, why states are being blocked from doing more, and whether you've discussed climate change with Vice President Gore lately? [SEP] Look, it's about having the *right* strategy. The question isn't whether we care about greenhouse gases – of course we do. The question is, what's the *most effective* way to tackle this? Is it 50 different states doing their own thing, or a unified national approach? Director Johnson made a decision based on the new law, which gives us a national plan. We're talking about raising CAFE standards and using more alternative fuels. That's a national solution. I spoke with Vice President Gore, and I assured him I'm taking this seriously. We're developing a strategy, and this bill is part of it. Replacing gasoline with alternatives will make a big difference. The bill I signed was a bit weaker than I wanted, but it's still a good step. We need to invest in cellulosic ethanol, not just corn. That's a real national plan. But let's be clear: this is a global problem. That's why I was against Kyoto – China wasn't included. We need major emitters at the table. We're working on that, as I said at the G-8 and in Bali. I take this seriously, but we can't wreck our economy in the process. We need to be prosperous to invest in new technologies. And if you're serious about greenhouse gases, you should support nuclear power. It's the best way to generate electricity without emissions. So, we have a strategy: higher CAFE standards, alternative fuels, nuclear power. And we have tons of coal, so we need to find ways to use it cleanly. Our strategy is to bring others to the table, develop a national plan, and meet international goals. That's the plan.", "label": "General"}

I mean, it's very important for the American people to remember what life was like in Afghanistan prior to the liberation of the country. We had a government in place that abused people's human rights. They didn't believe in women's rights, they didn't let little girls go to school, and they provided safe haven to Al Qaida. In the liberation of this country, we've achieved some very important strategic objectives: denying Al Qaida safe haven from which to plot and plan attacks and replacing this repressive group with a young democracy.And it's difficult in Afghanistan. I mean, it's—if you know the history of the country, you understand it's hard to go from the kind of society in which they had been living to one in which people are now responsible for their own behavior. But I am pleased with a lot of things. One, I'm pleased with the number of roads that have been built. I'm pleased with the number of schools that have opened up. I'm pleased a lot of girls, young girls, are going to school. I'm pleased health clinics are now being distributed around the country. I'm pleased with the Afghan Army, that when they're in the fight, they're good.I wish we had completely eliminated the radicals who kill innocent people to achieve objectives, but that hasn't happened yet.

{"sentence": "Last May, you surpassed your predecessor, George W. Bush, in time served as President during wartime. If you complete your presidency with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you'll be the only two-term President to have served with the country at war. How do you feel about this reality, given your campaign promises? And should Americans resign themselves to perpetual war, even if it's not the all-out war of the 20th century? [SEP] Okay, interesting question. First, about the State Department, I am concerned. The problem is the sheer volume of information. Email, texts, smartphones – it's generating a data deluge. It's convenient, I get info in real-time my predecessors waited weeks for. But it's overwhelming the Department, sorting, classifying, securing it from cyber-attacks. Over-classify, and the information's useless. Secretary Kerry's working on it. It's a government-wide problem. FOIA requests are up, the information is massive. It's worse for national security. We're trying to fix it. As for war, when I took office, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now it's a fraction of that. They're not in active combat, but training and advising, except for strikes against ISIS with Iraqi and Syrian partners. Our operations are different now. But you're right, dealing with non-state actors in weak countries means partnering to secure borders and eliminate threats. Afghanistan takes time. They're fighting, more capable now, but need support. We could pull out, let the country collapse, and go back in later. Or we can maintain a limited partnership. We can't get a MacArthur-Emperor moment with non-state actors. We defeated al-Qaeda in Iraq, transitioned to a democracy, but Sunni resentment allowed it to rebuild in Syria and return. Some say we should have stayed. But the Iraqi government didn't want us, unlike Afghanistan. I can't risk our troops without protection. So, I'm trying to build a structure emphasizing partnerships, fragile states, conflict resolution, local partners, and targeted strikes. It's a hybrid approach. The good news is fewer wars between states, almost none between great powers. But this low-grade threat can do real damage and create fear. We need to do better. I put out data on civilian drone casualties to hold ourselves accountable. It's imperfect, but we're improving. Whether it's the NSA, drone strikes, or Guantanamo, I'm confident my efforts will be on firmer legal footing, more consistent with our values. But there's more to do. I spend a lot of time on this.

That's the kind of system President Uribe supports, and it's the kind of system the United States supports. We want to see a fair and transparent process, free from political interference.

We usually try to coordinate the two to avoid unnecessary travel for world leaders. The idea to move the G-8 to Camp David came later. I realized I hadn't yet hosted my counterparts there. The G-8 is a more informal setting for intimate discussions. I thought it would be a good opportunity for us to connect in a relaxed atmosphere, and it'll give me a chance to meet with President Putin. And I have full confidence in Chicago's ability to handle security for the NATO summit. Mayor Emanuel will ensure everything runs smoothly.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. ——the supply/demand equation would improve. Why have you not sort of called on Americans to drive less and to turn down the thermostat? [SEP] They're smart enough to figure out whether they're going to drive less or not. I mean, you know, it's interesting what the price of gasoline has done—is it caused people to drive less. That's why they want smaller cars, they want to conserve. But the consumer is plenty bright, Mark. The marketplace works.Secondly, we have worked with Congress to change CAFE standards and had a mandatory alternative fuel requirement.So no question about it, what you just said is right. One way to correct the imbalance is to save, is to conserve. And as you noticed in my statement yesterday, I talked about good conservation. And people can figure out whether they need to drive more or less; they can balance their own checkbooks.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "President Obama, what's your take on the TPP's congressional hurdles and the criticism surrounding Mullah Mansur's death in Pakistan? [SEP] Well, on TPP, these trade deals always stir up debate. Everyone wants a better deal, especially with multiple countries involved. And in an election year? Expect political posturing. But I'm confident we'll get it done. It's good for America, good for the region, good for the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for us. They sell to us with low tariffs, but ours are higher there. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods. It's a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals faced complaints about lower wages and labor practices. TPP addresses that with enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and tackle environmental issues. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP makes us worse off. We're demonstrably better off. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean and Colombian deals. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too. Currency manipulation? We have transparency and reporting provisions. Some wanted enforceable tariffs, but it's hard to determine manipulation. Binding others' monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. We've strengthened provisions to monitor competitive devaluations. On Mullah Mansur, his death is confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This isn't a shift in approach. We're not re-entering combat. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself. But when a high-profile leader consistently plans to harm our people and resists peace talks, I have a responsibility to act.

I also made it clear that a terrorist like Ferhat Abdi Sahin, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Turkish civilians and a protégé of Abdullah Öcalan, should not be considered an interlocutor by the United States. It's hard to understand why a country fighting terrorism would welcome such a person, as Russia has also done. To fight terrorism effectively, we need more sensitivity.

What specific leverage are you willing to use to pressure China on human rights? Furthermore, President Lee, concerning North Korea, given their history of broken promises, what guarantees can you offer that this time will be different? [SEP] I've consistently communicated to Chinese leaders the importance of respecting religious freedom and freedom of expression. These values are essential for a thriving society. I've made this clear in every meeting. My presence at the Olympics is a dual purpose: to honor the Chinese people and to support our athletes. I hope our team excels, but it's also a chance to reinforce our principles. I don't need the Olympics to express my views on religious freedom, as I've been doing it throughout my presidency. Regarding the six-party talks, skepticism is understandable given North Korea's past actions. However, I commend President Bush's leadership in dealing with this difficult situation. Denuclearization is paramount. We will remain patient, consistent, and committed to verification. We must all work together to ensure North Korea fulfills its obligations.

Pakistan's an important ally. We share interests. We both want to stop terrorists. And as for Africa, America is a generous nation. We can help them and ourselves at the same time.

You can't have a peaceful change with him still calling the shots after all that. But it's not easy. Russia and China, they've been tougher to get on board with the pressure thing. We had a real talk. We're not exactly seeing eye-to-eye with them, but they know civil war's bad news and they don't like the killings. They get that a new government would be better for everyone. I told them we need to work with the UN and Kofi Annan on a plan. Hopefully, we can show the world, especially the Syrian people, a way out of this. Russia and China aren't totally on board yet, but they know things are bad and it's not helping them. We all agree that helping the Syrians find peace is the way to go.

As I've stated previously, not every initiative we undertake will yield the exact results we anticipate. We're navigating uncharted territory, and while there's a broad consensus among economists regarding the need for a recovery package, we still have to tackle the financial system, the housing market, and the regulatory framework.

I've worked with many of them in the Senate and House, and they're honest and straightforward. The world is watching us. At the first G-7 meeting, I declared, 'America is back.' One leader asked, 'For how long?' Another asked what I'd say if thousands stormed the British Parliament to stop an election confirmation.

{"sentence": "Considering the bipartisan resistance to comprehensive immigration reform, could you detail your plan to overcome congressional obstacles and address the current stalemate in the Senate? [SEP] Well, the reason a consensus bill hasn't emerged in the Senate is because this is a complex issue requiring bipartisan cooperation. It's crucial to first establish a coherent Republican position in the Senate, which is where we're currently focusing our efforts. Senator Kennedy will lead the bill on the Democrat side. Once we achieve a unified Republican stance, one that most Republicans support, we'll collaborate with the Senator. Without sufficient consensus, nothing will pass the Senate, and consequently, nothing will happen in the House. Therefore, the initial stages of crafting a bill that addresses concerns are time-consuming but essential to address the issues raised during the last immigration reform debate. I'm optimistic that we can achieve something, and we're beginning to find common ground. There's broad agreement on a temporary-worker plan allowing individuals to legally come to the U.S. for jobs Americans aren't doing. This would greatly benefit Guatemalan citizens, eliminating the need to enter the country illegally, pay smugglers, or live in hiding. They'd be able to enter legally. Secondly, they'd be able to return home to their families legally, without fear. There would be a time limit, which is part of the negotiations. The difficult issue is what to do with those who've been in our country for an extended period. This is a sensitive issue with significant political implications.

Step two will be full declaration of any plutonium that has been manufactured and/or the construction of bombs, along with a full declaration of any proliferation activities. And in my judgment, the best way to solve this issue with North Korea peacefully is to put it in the— keep it in the context of the six-party talks. And the reason why is that diplomacy only works if there are consequences when diplomacy breaks down. And it makes sense for there to be other people at the table so that if North Korea were to have said to all of us, We're going to do x, y, or z, and they don't, that we have other— people other than the United States being consequential.There's a lot of aid that goes on with— between North Korea and China, or North Korea and South Korea, and therefore, if they renege on their promises—and they have said—they have declared that they will show us weapons and get rid of the weapons programs as well as stop proliferation— if they don't fulfill that which they've said, we are now in a position to make sure that they understand that there will be consequences.And I'm pleased with the progress we're making.

What other political leverage can you bring to bear to help move a bill in the House?

We've got evidence that our housing market would be stronger if immigrants are in a situation in which, having paid a fine, having paid back taxes, that they now have the ability to actually enter into the housing market. We've got strong evidence that our technological and research edge would be better if we get immigration reform done.We know that the Senate bill strengthens border security, puts unprecedented resources on top of the unprecedented resources I've already put into border security. So if your main priority is border security, I'd think you'd want to vote for this bill. We know that the Senate bill creates a system in which employers are held accountable for when they hire undocumented workers. This is something that people say is a bad thing. I agree. Let's make sure that that system for holding employers accountable is in place.So when I hear the opposition to immigration reform, I just run through the list of things they're concerned about, I look at what the Senate bill does, and I say to myself, you know what, the Senate bill actually improves the situation on every issue that they say they're concerned about.Now, what they may argue is, it doesn't solve the problem 100 percent. I don't know a law that solves a problem 100 percent. Social Security lifted millions of seniors out of poverty, but there are still some poor seniors. The Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act drastically reduced discrimination in America, but there's still discrimination. That doesn't make them bad laws; it just means that there are very few human problems that are 100 percent solvable.So what I see right now is a strong bipartisan vote coming out of the Senate. I think that the Speaker and others have said they need to do something, and I'd urge, when they get back, to do something, put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass. It may not be precisely what's in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill. But if they've got some additional ideas, I think the Senate is happy to consider them. And get that bill on the floor, put it up for a vote.I am absolutely certain that the votes for the Senate bill, which strengthens border security, demands responsibility from undocumented workers to pay a fine—pay a penalty and get to the back of the line, reforms our legal immigration system, holds employers accountable, I am absolutely confident that if that bill was on the floor of the House, it would pass.So the challenge right now is not that there aren't a majority of House Members, just like a majority of Senate Members, who aren't prepared to support this bill. The problem is internal Republican caucus politics. And that's what the American people don't want us to be worrying about. Don't worry about your Washington politics, solve problems.And this is one where you've actually got some pretty broad consensus.

And Prime Minister, concerning President Trump's desire for Japan to strengthen its defense, including purchasing U.S. military equipment, and reports of his disappointment regarding the North Korean missile incident, did this topic arise, and what is your message regarding Japan's defense role? [SEP] Thank you. If I may address a portion of the Prime Minister's response, he will indeed intercept those missiles once he finalizes the acquisition of substantial military equipment from the United States. It will be a straightforward matter, much like our successful interception in Saudi Arabia. A rapidly moving missile neutralized with precision and without collateral damage. The Prime Minister of Japan will be procuring significant quantities of military equipment, as he should. We manufacture the finest military equipment globally. Whether it's the F-35 fighter, unparalleled in its stealth capabilities, or a variety of missiles, this translates to jobs for us and enhanced security for Japan and other nations purchasing our equipment, something that was not happening a year or two ago. As for China, my relationship with President Xi is excellent. I consider him a friend, and he reciprocates. However, he represents China, and I represent the United States. Our perspectives may differ, but we share common ground on trade. The issue with China is that for decades, the trade situation has been, to put it mildly, unfair. Our trade deficit is enormous, ranging from $350 billion to $504 billion annually, excluding intellectual property. We have initiated discussions with China to rectify this imbalance. It must be addressed through fair and reciprocal trade practices. I prefer the term 'reciprocal' because it resonates with people.

But when you frame it as 'reciprocal,' where we charge the same rates they charge us, it becomes more palatable, even if it's 100 percent. Reciprocal trade is paramount. We have numerous countries, not just China or Japan, that engage in such practices. One country, for instance, levies a 100 percent tax on our exports while charging us nothing on theirs. I have long opposed this, and we will take action. This process takes time due to statutory limitations. Notices must be issued, and waiting periods observed. However, much of this has already been addressed. You will witness the United States taking decisive action against countries that have treated our companies, workers, and nation unfairly. This has already commenced, and the legal groundwork is complete. Significant changes are imminent. The United States has been treated unfairly in trade for far too long. Regarding Japan's defense equipment, we procure a significant portion from the United States. Given the challenging North Korean situation and the Asia-Pacific security environment, we must enhance our defense capabilities both qualitatively and quantitatively. The F-35A and SM-3 Block IIA are prime examples of planned purchases from the United States. Aegis vessels will also be enhanced in both quality and quantity. In this process, we will be increasing our purchases from the United States. Concerning North Korea's missile launches, we immediately tracked their trajectory. Missile defense is a collaborative effort between Japan and the United States. If interception and shooting down become necessary, we will certainly do so, in close coordination with the United States.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

[SEP] Okay so Turkey is an interesting case—because there's another one Jim that I get along with very well and he's a tough cookie okay? Right? President Erdogan. He's tough but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing but I think it's a really good thing. Because frankly he wanted to wipe out—he has a big problem with the Kurds as everyone knows. And he had a 65000-man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the Kurds who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.And I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are I guess natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had—they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with and I said You can't do that. You can't do it. And he didn't do it.So I have a relationship. But let me tell you—so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy—even though he's a member of NATO and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the President. He—and he's got a big army and he's—you know they're fighters. Turkey is—big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed and neither do I—in Syria. But—and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned folks to President Putin. I said Please take it easy with Idlib. Because you know they've been encircling that.I think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know getting terrorists is okay but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.So anyway—so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey—and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no no no. Couldn't buy it. Now he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it.So he goes out he goes to Russia and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good but he made a deal. He paid them money a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said Listen we don't want you to use that system because it's not the NATO system et cetera et cetera—you know all the reasons: We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor we'll sell you the Patriot. He said It's too late. I already bought it. There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.In the meantime he bought over a hundred F-35s the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money up front to Lockheed our company our jobs everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the S-400 system Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.But honestly I'm all for our country but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it you can't buy it. You know it's the old secret when you can't have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were—they said—first they said: We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years. Then they said We'll get it to you immediately. But he said: I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system—similar system—from Russia.

And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G-7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.And you know—and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.If my memory serves me well—and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister—we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where—to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country—or 150,000 forces and invade that country—invade that country without any rationale other than—if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland.You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was—just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.And the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand—if we had stood still, what signal would that send to about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the—let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.But—and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, that has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe—well beyond Europe.I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe—well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri-La capture that.And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change.

It'll be resolved the same way it would have been without a shutdown. So, it's not productive. This goes to a broader point: In a democracy, parties disagree.

Kabul, with a large part of the population, has been policed by Afghan forces for a long time, and they've done a pretty good job. Kabul is safer than it was, and Afghan forces are more capable. That doesn't mean these attacks won't happen; they probably will for a while. Our work isn't finished. But, as I said, the tide of war is receding.

I am optimistic that the new administration will strike a balance between engagement and upholding these principles. The President-elect's commitment to NATO is reassuring. On cyber security, we must collaborate to establish international standards and prevent a digital arms race. The smooth transition of power in the US underscores its democratic strength, and I am confident that the strong bonds between the US and Germany will persist.

However, I anticipate he will test the resolve of the West, the United States, and NATO to the fullest extent possible. He will face significant consequences that he doesn't currently anticipate. He will come to regret his actions. He perceives the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet empire as a profound loss for Russia. He possesses immense territory, but is struggling to define his position between China and the West. I'm uncertain if he has a clear plan. My expectation is that he will intervene. He feels compelled to take action. He seeks assurances that Ukraine will not join NATO and that strategic weapons will not be deployed there. We can potentially find common ground on the latter, contingent on his behavior. The former presents a greater challenge, as international agreements uphold the right of nations to choose their affiliations. Nevertheless, Ukraine's accession to NATO in the immediate future is improbable. There's an opportunity for negotiation if he's willing.

Severe weather events are increasingly frequent. I firmly believe climate change is real and driven by human emissions. We have a responsibility to future generations. In my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency and clean energy production, reducing carbon emissions. But we need to do more. I'll consult with scientists, engineers, and politicians to identify short-term carbon reduction strategies and foster a national conversation on long-term solutions. I'm unsure what Democrats or Republicans will support, as regional differences exist. Addressing climate change seriously requires tough choices.

I wouldn't put a number on it, but the reality is, no single action is going to solve everything. We're in uncharted waters. Economists generally agree on the path forward, the need for a substantial recovery package, a combination of tax cuts and investments. But even if we do all that perfectly, we still have to fix the financial system, get the banks lending again, address the housing crisis, and establish a regulatory system to prevent future crises.

If it prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, it's good for everyone. If not, no deal. On Israeli-Palestinian relations, it's about what both sides believe is possible. Prime Minister Netanyahu said no Palestinian state under his watch. He later added conditions, but they seem impossible. It's not about instant statehood, but a framework for hope.

We implemented a plan that economists say averted a depression. A third of that plan was tax cuts. We haven't waited until now. We've cut taxes for small businesses eight times in 18 months. These actions have made a difference. Three million people have jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. The economy would be worse. But we're not where we need to be. So, what else can we do? Our proposals have historically had bipartisan support: R&D tax credit, accelerated business depreciation. On infrastructure, we're ramping up the highway bill. We're rebuilding America. We'll pay for it by ending tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas. These are commonsense approaches. Historically, Republicans and Democrats agree on infrastructure and R&D.

{"sentence": "Q. And if I may, could I ask the other question, because I think it might get an interesting response. You, last May, passed a milestone in that you are now were President longer when the country was at war than your predecessor, George W. Bush. And if you complete your Presidency, as you will, with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you will be the only two-term President in American history to have served with the country at war. And I wonder, given the way that you ran for office and the aspirations you brought into office, how you feel about that reality? And then, a second follow-up on that: Should the American people simply resign themselves to living in a state of perpetual war, even if that war is not the all-out war that we think of in the 20th century? [SEP] Okay. That was an interesting question so—first of all, with respect to the State Department, I am concerned. And the challenge that we've got is primarily driven by the changing nature of how information flows. Look, the advent of e-mail and texts and smartphones is just generating enormous amounts of data. Now, it is hugely convenient. It means that in real time I'm getting information that some of my predecessors might not have gotten for weeks.But what it also is doing is creating this massive influx of information on a daily basis, putting enormous pressure on the Department to sort through it, classify it properly, figure out what are the various points of entry because of the cyber-attack risks that these systems have, knowing that our adversaries are constantly trying to hack into these various systems. If you overclassify, then all the advantages of this new information suddenly go away because it's taking too long to process. And so we've been trying to think about this in a smart way. And I think Secretary Kerry has got a range of initiatives to try to get our arms around this. It reflects a larger problem in Government. We just recently, for example—I just recently signed a bill about FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act requests, that built on a number of reforms that we've put in place. We're processing more Freedom of Information Act requests and doing so faster than ever before. The problem is the volume of requests has skyrocketed. The amount of information that answers the request has multiplied exponentially.So, across Government, you're seeing this problem. And it's a problem in terms of domestic affairs. It becomes an even bigger problem when you're talking about national security issues. So it is something that we're going to have to take care of.With respect to reflections on war, when I came into office, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we have a fraction of that. They are not involved in active combat situations, but are involved in train, advise, and assist situations, other than the direct attacks that we launch against ISIL in conjunction with the Iraq Government and the Syrian Government [partners on the ground in Syria; White House correction.].So, in some ways, Mark, I think you'd recognize that our military operations today in Iraq and Afghanistan are fundamentally different than the wars that we were engaged in when I came into office. But I think you are making an important point, which is when we are dealing with nonstate actors, and those nonstate actors are located in countries with limited capacity, our ultimate goal is to partner with those countries so that they can secure their borders and, themselves, eliminate these terrorist threats.But as we've seen in Afghanistan, for example, that takes some time. The Afghans are fighting. They are much more capable now than they were when I came into office. But they still need support, because it's really tough territory, and it's a really poor country with really low literacy rates and not much experience in things that we take for granted like logistics.And so we have an option of going in, taking out Al aida, pulling out, potentially then seeing a country crumble under the strains of continued terrorist activity or insurgency, and then going back in. Or we can try to maintain a limited partnership that allows them to continue to build their capacity over time and selectively take our own actions against those organizations that we know are trying to attack us or our allies.Because they're nonstate actors, it's very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of McArthur and the Emperor meeting and a war officially being over. AI was defeated in the sense that we were able to execute a transition to a democratically elected Iraqi Government. But for all of our efforts and the incredible courage and bravery and sacrifice of our troops, the political structure there was still uneven. You had continued Sunni resentments, continued de-Baathification, and as a consequence, those vestiges of AI were able to reconstitute themselves, move into Syria as Syria began to engage in civil war, rebuild, and then come back in.Some have argued that this is the reason why we should have never pulled out of Iraq, or at least, we should have left some larger presence there. Of course, the problem was that we didn't have an Iraqi Government that wanted them, unlike Afghanistan, where we've been invited. And it's very difficult for us to—for me, as Commander in Chief, to want to put our troops in a precarious situation where they're not protected. So I think what we've been trying to do, what I've been trying to do, is to create an architecture, a structure—and it's not there yet—that emphasizes partnerships with countries, emphasizes building up fragile states, resolving internal conflicts wherever we can, trying to do as much as we can through our local partners, preserving the possibility, the necessity to take strikes ourselves against organizations or individuals that we know are trying to kill Americans or Belgians or French or Germans, combine that with much more effective intelligence gathering. But it becomes more of a hybrid approach to national security. And that I do think is probably going to be something that we have to continue to grapple with for years to come.The good news is that there are fewer wars between states than ever before and almost no wars between great powers. And that's a great legacy of leaders in the United States and Europe and Asia, after the cold war—or after the end of World War II that built this international architecture. That's worked. And we should be proud of that and preserve it.But this different kind of low-grade threat, one that's not an existential threat, but can do real damage and real harm to our societies and creates the kind of fear that can cause division and political reactions—we have to do that better. We have to continually refine it.So, for example, the reason that I put out our announcement about the civilian casualties resulting from drone attacks—understanding that there are those who dispute the numbers—what I'm trying to do there is to institutionalize a system where we begin to hold ourselves accountable for this different kind of national security threat and these different kinds of operations.And it's imperfect, still. But I think we can get there. And what I can say honestly is, whether we're talking about how the NSA operates or how drone strikes operate or how we're partnering with other countries or my efforts to close Guantanamo, that by the end of my Presidency—or banning torture—by the end of my Presidency, I feel confident that these efforts will be on a firmer legal footing, more consistent with international law and norms, more reflective of our values and our ethics. But we're going to have more work to do. It's not perfect, and we have to wrestle with these issues all the time.And as Commander in Chief of the most powerful military in the world, I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I'm not satisfied that we've got it perfect yet. I can say honestly, it's better than it was when I came into office.Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Poland.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the fight against ISIL, some suggest a strategy of containment. Do you believe containment is sufficient, or is complete annihilation the only acceptable outcome? Furthermore, considering the limitations of airstrikes, what role do you envision for ground forces, particularly the Free Syrian Army, in achieving the complete destruction of ISIL in Syria? [SEP] Containment is simply not an option when dealing with an organization that disregards borders, spreads chaos, displaces populations, commits atrocities, and enslaves women. Our objective must be to dismantle them entirely. Think back to Al Qaeda in the FATA; we pushed them back, systematically degraded their capabilities, limited their operational scope, reduced their territory, and eliminated their leadership. Over time, their ability to conduct large-scale attacks diminished. Now, will remnants still exist, hiding and plotting? Of course. We'll hunt them down, just as we do with Al Qaeda remnants in the FATA, al-Shabaab elements in Somalia, or any terrorist worldwide. But we aim to dismantle this network, this force controlling vast territory, so they can no longer threaten us. That's our goal, and I'm encouraged by the unanimous support from our allies. Regarding Syria, we won't deploy U.S. ground troops to control conflict zones. It's unnecessary. We need effective partners on the ground to push back against ISIL. The moderate coalition is a viable option; we have experience with them. They've been outgunned, so we'll support them more effectively. Remember, when U.S. forces put ISIL on the defensive, ground forces can achieve remarkable results, even if initially outmatched.

{"sentence": "Q. Good afternoon, President Bush and Prime Minister. And I thought that this summit would be the—would—actually Plan Mexico would come out of this, the combination of three governments to combat the effects of drug trafficking. What is the obstacle? What is it causing the delay? Why don't the societies of each country know what this plan is about? And can you actually confirm the support of the United States to Mexico? Apparently, it will increase tenfold, and the levels will be similar to Colombia. We hear very often that the United States wants to take part in this situation against drugs, this war on drugs, and we see it very clearly in Mexico. Now, what is it all about? Could you tell us? [SEP] Man! [] ! [] We discussed a common strategy to deal with a common problem, and that is narcotrafficking and violence on our border. First, let me say that in order to develop an effective, common strategy requires—there needs to be serious consultations between our respective governments. It's one thing to say, we're interested in working together, it's another thing to develop a package on both sides of the border that will be effective in dealing with the problem. That's what our people expect us to do. They expect us to see a problem and to develop an effective strategy to deal with that problem. President Calderon and I met in Mexico, and we had a serious discussion to get this initiative on the table. This is an interim meeting, a meeting for us to make sure that the strategy that's being developed is— will be effective. And so we reviewed where we are in the process.The United States is committed to this joint strategy to deal with a joint problem. I would not be committed to dealing with this if I wasn't convinced that President Calderon had the will and the desire to protect his people from narcotraffickers. He has shown great leadership and great strength of character, which gives me good confidence that the plan we'll develop will be effective. And the fundamental question is, what can we do together to make sure that the common strategy works? And that's where we are in the discussions right now.There's all kinds of speculation about the size of the package, this, that, and the other. All I can tell you is, the package, when it's developed, will be robust enough to achieve a common objective, which is less violence on both sides of the border and to deal with narcotrafficking. And we both have responsibilities. And that's what the package is entailed to develop. It's to develop how do we share our joint responsibilities.It's in our interests that this program go forward. You mentioned Plan Colombia; this is not like Plan Colombia. This is different from Plan Colombia. This is a plan that says, we've got an issue on our own border. We share a border, and therefore, it's a joint program that will mean—that won't mean U.S. armed presence in your country. Mexico is plenty capable of handling the problem. And the question is, is there any way for us to help strengthen the effort? And so that's what we're studying.And I can't give you a definitive moment when the plan will be ready, but we're working hard to get a plan ready. And it's a plan that, once it's proposed and out there, I strongly urge the United States Congress to support. It's in our interests, it's in the U.S. interests that we get this issue solved. Thank you, President Bush, for your comments and also for the question, because this allows us to emphasize the fact that—well, the President has already said, it's a common strategy to combat, in a coordinated way, a common problem. Drug trafficking and violence that's associated to drug trafficking, which is particularly evident on the border between the U.S. and Mexico, cannot be dealt with in an isolated way. It has to be confronted by, dealt with by the people and by the governments that are directly affected by this scourge. And it requires a variety, a multiplicity of actions carried out by society, by governments, in other words, enforcement activities against criminals, preventive activities, protective activities, prevention and treatment of addictions with the young.Now, I agree with President Bush; it's very important to reduce—well, to have clear policies to reduce the consumption patterns in terms of drugs, including Mexico, because this is a main cause of the problem that we're facing.Now, last week, for example, last week, three Federal policemen were murdered in Mexico—Mexican policemen, that is—and they were tortured in a very cowardly way. And those Mexican policemen are fully committed towards the Government to free the young Mexicans from drugs and to free Mexican society from slavery on the part of organized crime based on money and technology. And I don't want any—not one single Mexican policeman to have a logistical disadvantage when facing these criminals. I don't want my Government to be responsible for any omission, any legal omission within a legal framework that would have been directed towards defeating these criminals.So this is a common strategy because it means that the U.S. will do its part and Mexico will do its part. Now, what do we want the U.S. to do—to carry out—have greater surveillance along the border. We are seeing high-powered weapons into Mexico, and we know that we can do much more than we're doing at this point in time. I know that drugs go from Mexico to the U.S. Both of us have to agree so that there is surveillance, efficient surveillance, that is, on both sides of the border. We are facing mafias that are working on both sides of the border. That is quite clear to us. And I think that we will not be acting in an efficient way as long as they have a coordinated strategy and we don't. In other words, they're coordinated on both sides of the border; we are not.So I would like to introduce into the— well, we have to be respectful of our legislation, our respective legislations. I would want to create a strategy in order to defeat this scourge. And that requires a variety of instruments, strategies, exchange of intelligence, exchange of technology. It also means that we have to keep in mind issues of sovereignty. I told President Bush, though, we did not want to have U.S. soldiers working in our country, as has happened in other countries. I know that that's typical, of course. But we've said this very clearly, we put forth this very clearly, and in the framework of our own legislations, we will find a way out.And I would also wonder what the men and women are thinking now, those who are suffering from crime, how scared are they, what's the degree of their fear that has led these groups to be so powerful, to grow so much. And they've essentially taken power in their area of operation. We have developed an aggressive policy to combat organized crime, and I haven't hesitated to use our forces to recover the areas. We've taken about 10,000 drug traffickers to jail, many weapons, 50-millimeter cannons, grenades capable of bringing down aircraft.And I think—so I cannot send the Mexican policemen to combat this situation with their hands tied. So I have to answer to the Mexican people in order to preserve their security, and I will do so without abusing human rights and without distorting Mexican legislation. I will respect Mexican legislation fully. But I am calling upon my neighbor in order to act in a coordinated way, because it's a situation we both have to face. It's a problem that affects two countries, and only together will we be able to solve it.There are several causes. It involves several joint responsibilities. And the action, therefore, has to be shared, within the legal framework. What's the scope of this strategy? I cannot tell you now; we cannot tell you now. We're just exchanging assessments, needs, assessing the situation and making it clear what the rules are for each country.We will have a strategy—I think it's possible—but we will not be able to come up with it until we finish our discussions and negotiations, which, by nature, are very complex. But in the end, that is what we're trying to combat. And it's a problem that's affecting Mexican citizens as well as U.S. nationals. This is an example. We are all sovereign nations, that is quite true, but we are not isolated problems according to our own sovereignty. We have shared problems—for example, drug trafficking. This is a good example. It begins in a country in the Americas or in the Caribbean, but the consequences are seen in the streets in Canada. And we have to discuss these problems. We have to compare our strategies, and sometimes we have to work hand in hand.[.]Once again, this is a perfect example of why we meet. We're sovereign countries, but problems are not—problems don't limit themselves to the boundaries of our countries. Drug trafficking is a perfect example. These problems may originate in some of the countries of Latin America or the Caribbean, but the problems are felt on the streets and the communities of Canada. And that's why we meet to discuss; that's why we meet to compare strategies; that's why we, from time to time, have to engage in shared action.Let me just say one other thing, if I can, about the drug trade, because indirect reference was made to Colombia. Canada has undertaken negotiations of a trade agreement with Colombia. We have a Government in Colombia that wants to share in the benefits of free and open markets. We don't need to have a trade agreement to have a drug trade with Colombia. The drug traffickers aren't going to wait for our parliaments or our congresses to pass a trade agreement in order to have a drug trade. But if we want to have other opportunities for the people of Colombia and mutual development and shared prosperity, we've got to move forward on these kinds of initiatives. And that's why the Government of Canada is committed to working with Colombia and getting a trade deal.", "label": "Explicit"}

And secondly, do you want your Presidency, the French Presidency to be one which, as you called for, continues to push Europe forward? And do you not think that the Irish no is going to hinder this? [SEP] Well, it's going to make things more difficult, but when you're a head of state and when the bubble— you take over the Presidency of the Union, if you like easy jobs, then you should step down straightaway.Now, the Irish no is a political reality. It's a fact; it's happened. But the issue is not whether we like or not. It's a fact; we have to live with it. The Irish people said what they had to say, and we have to accept that. Now, having said that, we, with Angela Merkel, believe that we have to continue with the ratification process, because at this stage, 18 European states have ratified the treaty. We have to continue doing so, and that is Gordon Brown's intention, as he explained to me yesterday over the telephone, so that this Irish hiccup not become a major crisis.So, despite that, let's continue to ratify. But at the same time, we have to put our heads together, all of us. It is no coincidence, it is no surprise to a certain extent— in fact, I spoke yesterday with the Irish , the Irish Prime Minister. A lot of Europeans do not understand how we are shaping Europe right now and building Europe, and we have to take account of that. And we have to do so very fast. We have to change our way of building Europe.The idea of a European construct, it was one of the most wonderful ideas that the founding fathers had some half a century ago. We are not allow—we shouldn't sabotage it. But perhaps we should do it differently. Europe was set up to protect, and yet it worries so many Europeans. We can't not take account of this. We have to do so, and we have to do so now. So I have every intention of taking initiatives. I'm thinking, for instance, of a European immigration policy. I'm thinking of a European response to this endless increase in oil prices. It seems to me that we have a duty to be more effective and look at what the daily lives of our citizens—fellow citizens— look like. And I take the Irish no as a call for us to do things differently and do things better.Now, of course, it's not going to simplify the work and the task of the French President—Presidency of the European Union, but—— Olivier [Olivier Knox, Agence France-Presse].

[SEP] Obviously, I'm aware of the press reports on the situation in , but I'm not going to make a statement on the issue. What I would like to emphasize is that every time we meet with , the issue of human rights comes up. It is our belief that not only is that the right thing to do because it comports with our principles and our belief in freedom and human rights, but also because we actually think will be stronger as it opens up and liberalizes its own system.We want to be strong, and we want it to be prosperous. And we're very pleased with all the areas of cooperation that we've been able to engage in. But we also believe that that relationship will be that much stronger and will be that much more prosperous and strong as you see improvements on human rights issues in that country.I know it wasn't directed at me, but I'll just make a quick statement around North Korea. This was a topic of extensive discussion between myself and Our consultation throughout the failed missile launch was, I think, reflective of how important our alliance is not just to our two countries, but to the region as a whole. And what I've tried to do since I came into office is to make sure that the North Koreans understand that the old pattern of provocation that then gets attention and somehow insists on the world purchasing good behavior from them, that that pattern is broken.And what we've said is, is that the more you engage in provocative acts, the more isolated you will become, the stronger sanctions will be in place, the more isolated you will be diplomatically, politically, and commercially. And so although we can't anticipate--and I don't want to hypothesize on what might happen in the coming months--I think Pyongyang is very clear that the United States, Japan, South Korea, other countries in the region are unified in insisting that it abide by its responsibilities, abide by international norms, and that they will not be able to purchase anything from further provocative acts. With regard to North Korea, between myself and President Obama earlier we--with regard to the so-called launch of satellite--the missile launch--we share the view that it undermines the efforts of the various countries concerned to achieve resolution through dialogue.Now, in the latest round of missile launch, they also conducted a nuclear test, which means that there is a great possibility they will conduct a nuclear test. And I believe the international community as a whole, together, will need to call for restraint on the part of D.P.R.K. And more specifically, I believe the measures incorporated in the recent U.N. Security Council chairman's statement need to be complied with. And among Japan, the U.S., and Korea, as well as and Russia, we need to communicate with each other fully and also call--stress that 's role continues to be very important and cooperate with while also maintaining close coordination with the United States.

And on the matter of Iran, will you be making a final push for diplomatic resolution regarding their nuclear ambitions, perhaps through direct negotiations? [SEP] Look, a scenario where we stumble over the fiscal cliff isn't beyond the realm of possibility. If, despite the election results and the clear risks to our economy, Congressional intransigence prevents us from even agreeing on a middle-class tax cut, then those families will face a substantial tax increase. That's going to be a shock, affecting holiday sales and, in turn, business planning and hiring, potentially dragging us back into recession. It would be detrimental, and it's unnecessary. The immediate step is to provide certainty to middle-class families – 98% earning under $250,000 and 97% of small businesses – that their taxes won't rise. We can achieve that. Then, we can establish a framework for tax reform, addressing deductions, loopholes, simplification, and entitlements. I'm ready to make significant commitments to ensure deficit reductions that stabilize and reduce our debt. I'm confident we can do it. I've been dealing with this for a while now; the math is simple. Tough decisions are required, but we can do it without harming middle-class families, seniors, or families with disabled children, while continuing to invest in growth drivers like basic research and education. Even some Republican commentators acknowledge that a modest tax increase on the wealthy won't break them; they'll still be wealthy and it won't hinder business investment. So, we know how to proceed. It's a question of whether we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, and do what's right for the American people. I hope that's what happens. Regarding Iran, I strongly desire a diplomatic resolution. I've been consistent: we won't allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. But there's still time for diplomacy. We've imposed the toughest sanctions ever, impacting Iran's economy. They should be able to have peaceful nuclear power while meeting international obligations and providing assurances they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon.

{"sentence": "Q. Madam Chancellor, Mr. President. First, a question addressed to you, Mr. President. There are—were a number of hopes in the world that were in a way shattered as regards your legislative term, for example, the closing down of Guantanamo or scrapping the death penalty throughout the whole of the United States, in all of the States. And now, as regards Asia and—are you singling out Germany because there's a big risk here? Or——And, Madam Chancellor, the Nobel Prize winner, Obama is waging a drone war also via Germany. And is he allowed to do that, according to German law? [SEP] Let me see if I understood your question properly. First question was related to policies back home, related to Guantanamo or the death penalty. And then you wanted to talk about drones, or did you just want to focus on the drone question? I just want to make sure that I'm responsive to your question. I guess I ought to answer on the drones. And Guantanamo, that was a question, I believe, addressed to you. . Okay. Well, it continues to be my policy that I want to close Guantanamo. It has been more difficult than I had hoped, in part because there's been significant resistance from Congress on this, and on some issues, I need congressional authorization.But about a month ago I gave a speech in which I said that I would redouble my efforts to do so. Because 9/11 happened, and we now have been involved in one form or another in a war for over a decade. One war, I think, in Afghanistan, was necessary. One war I disagreed with strongly. But in either case, there are dangers if we get on a perpetual war footing.The threat of terrorism remains real, and we have to be vigilant, and we have to take steps to protect ourselves, consistent with our values and consistent with international law. But we also have to guard against being so driven by fear that we are not changing the fabric of our society in ways that we don't intend and do not want for the future. I think closing Guantanamo is an example of us getting out of that perpetual war mentality.Some of thepeople at Guantanamo are dangerous. Some of them did bad things. But we cannot have a permanent outpost in which they're being held even as we're ending a war in Afghanistan that triggered some of these—the capture of some of these detainees in the first place.So I'm confident that we can continue to make progress on this front, although, you're right, it has not been as fast as I would have liked. One of the things you discover as a politician is, is that people don't always do exactly what you want. It's shocking. And then you have to keep on working at it.One thing with respect to drone policy: In that speech that I gave, I also addressed that issue of—that, the lethal targeting of identified terrorists. This also is a source of controversy. We have constrained it tightly. And as we defeat Al Qaida, we have to, I think, very carefully examine how these technologies are used. I can say, though, that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones to go after counter—as part of our counterterrorism activities. And so I know that there have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case. That is not. Let me complement by saying that the United States of America have bases here, they have soldiers here. They fulfill a very important function, particularly in the fight against terrorism. If I think of Ramstein, for example—and also supplies to soldiers, but also caring for wounded soldiers.We as allies, as members of NATO, stand shoulder to shoulder here. And we provide bases for our activities, and our work is based also on shared values. As I said, we exchange on—have exchanges on values. But I think it's good.

Is that really the behavior of a friend?And, Prime Minister, is it a problem for you that some of the things Mr. Trump has said about your Brexit plan are right?

And fortunately, we tend to record stories now, so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it. But we record when we deal with reporters. It's called fake news. You know, we solve a lot of problems with the good, old recording instrument.But what happens is that—look, the Prime Minister, as I really just said, she's going to make a decision as to what she's going to do. The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us. We're, by far, their biggest trading partner. And we have just a tremendous opportunity to double, triple, quadruple that.So if they're going a slightly different route—and I know they do want independence. It's going to be independence; it's just your definition. But if they're going to go a certain route, I just said that I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States. I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.So, based on that, I—and based on just trade in general, and our other relationship—which will be fine—but the trade is a little bit tricky. We want to be able to trade, and they want to be able to trade, and I think we'll be able to do that. Okay? And I think she's doing a terrific job, by the way.. Thank you, Mr. President.

And just to be clear, that is an agreement that delivers on the Brexit vote that we had in 2016 here in the U.K., that delivers what I believe is at the forefront of people's mind when they were voting to leave the European Union.So at the end of these negotiations, we will ensure that free movement will come to an end. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice here in the U.K. will come to an end. The sending of vast sums of money every year to the EU will come to an end. We will come out of the Common Agricultural Policy. We will come out of the Common Fisheries Policy. And we will ensure, by not being in the Customs Union, that we are able to have an independent trade policy and do those trade deals around the world.

This will be a debate over the next few years. As soon as the new Congress is sworn in, we'll have to discuss how to balance our budget. That means cutting programs that don't work, but also being honest about paying for what's important. If we want to care for our veterans, we need to fund the doctors and facilities they need. If we want our children to succeed, we need to invest in education. If we want to stay competitive, we need to invest in basic research.

But my consistent message to leaders in the region is that this process of change can be a great opportunity for the Middle East, because if you can tap into the talents of those young people, then you can start seeing the kind of economic growth in that region that you've started to see in other places in the world.And there's no reason why countries in the Middle East shouldn't have the same kind of growth rates that you're seeing in China and India. There's nothing inherent about the people in those countries that would prevent that. What's preventing it is the fact that for many decades you've seen a lack of opening up that allows you to take advantage of the global economy.And I think that, as I said, each country is going to be different, and it's going to ultimately be up to the people in those countries to determine the best form for them to seize this opportunity, but we should be on the side of those who want to seize this opportunity.Okay?", "label": "Explicit"}

And, given potential policy shifts, do you believe Hillary Clinton's nomination is still uncertain? [SEP] I'm retired from running elections, and I won't speculate on future races. That's your domain. Regarding Cuba, we aim to empower the Cuban people with freedom and self-determination, supporting civil society. Change within Cuba is inevitable, driven partly by generational shifts. While we still have serious concerns about the Cuban government's human rights record and regional activities, there are also areas for cooperation, such as healthcare. My message to President Castro was consistent: we will advocate for our values through persuasion. Cuba is not a direct threat to the US, and our priorities lie elsewhere, including combating ISIL, preventing Iranian nuclear proliferation, addressing conflicts in Yemen and Libya, countering Boko Haram, and addressing Russian aggression in Ukraine. Our approach is to partner with the region, promoting opportunity, prosperity, and security. Overly aggressive intervention often backfires, providing excuses for governance failures.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much. We are the real Wall Street Journal.Mr. President, you tweeted earlier asking Virginia and New Jersey residents to vote. Democrat Terry McAuliffe is struggling in a State that you won by 10 points. Do you see—do you see his problems as a rebuke of your Presidency? And could this signal your real losses for Democrats in the midterms? [SEP] We're going to win. I think we're going to win in Virginia.And you know—you're reporting it being close—the race is very close. It's about who shows up, who turns out.And granted, I did win by a large margin, but the point of the matter is that I think that this is—this is going to be what we all knew from the beginning: This is going to be a tight race. And it is tight. And it's going to get down to turnout, and it's going to—my guess is that I'm going to be landing at 1 o'clock in the morning, East Coast time. That's probably about the time we'll be hearing what the final results are. I think we're going to win New Jersey as well.But look, you know, the off year is always unpredictable, especially when we don't have a general election going on at the same time. That's been the case all the—up and down, you know, for a long time, especially as Virginia has turned more and more blue.But having said that, I don't believe—and I've not seen any evidence that whether or not I am doing well or poorly, whether or not I've got my agenda passed or not is going to have any real impact on winning or losing.Even if we had passed my agenda, I wouldn't claim, We won because Biden's agenda passed. So—but I think it's a—I think it's going to be very close. I think it's going to get down to, as you all know, turnout.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, after calling the 2010 midterms a 'shellacking,' what's your take on this election? Also, any updates on your immigration executive order? Will the election change your plans, will it be out before the lame duck session ends, and has its scope been reduced? [SEP] Well, as I said before, the Republicans had a good night. We're going to reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner to see what their agenda is. Hopefully, we can find some common ground. The big message from this election, and from others recently, is: get things done. Focus on the concerns of regular Americans. Think about the single mom struggling with bills, the young person worried about college debt, the construction worker needing a job. If we focus on them, we can get things done. On immigration, I've always said I prefer Congress to act on comprehensive reform. We need to secure our borders, streamline legal immigration, and give those here illegally a chance to earn legal status. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill, which wasn't perfect but would improve things. I asked John Boehner to pass it in the House, but he couldn't. So, I'll use my executive authority to fix what I can, but I'll replace those actions with a bill from Congress if they pass one. That's a promise I made to the American people and to John Boehner. Before the end of the year, I'll take lawful executive actions to improve our immigration system and boost border security. I'll also talk to Republican and Democratic leaders about how to move forward. If they want to pass a bill, I'm ready to work with them. But I won't just wait.

{"sentence": "Sir, American troops are dying, sectarian violence is escalating, and you foresee more casualties. Realistically, how much longer can this Iraq policy continue without tangible results? And are you optimistic about finding the missing soldiers? [SEP] We are doing everything possible to find the missing soldiers. General Petraeus and Secretary Gates are fully informed, and we are utilizing all available intelligence and troops. It is a top priority. The loss of life is devastating, but I sent more troops to stabilize the capital. We haven't even fully deployed them yet. General Petraeus presented a plan to Congress aimed at helping the Iraqi government secure its capital and reconcile. All troops will be in place by mid-June. The increased fighting is due to our troops entering new areas with the Iraqis. General Petraeus has requested until September to report back on progress. I want to see a different configuration in Iraq, but that requires securing the capital, which is why I followed General Petraeus's recommendations. I favor the Baker-Hamilton approach of embedding, training, guarding territorial integrity, and using Special Forces against Al Qaida. But we needed to increase troop levels to secure the capital, as I feared violence would spiral out of control.

Absentee voting is fine, but universal mail-in voting is a disaster waiting to happen. Ballots are being lost, discarded, found in piles. It's going to be a catastrophe. Louis DeJoy is doing his best, but the Democrats are making it impossible. The Post Office has been losing billions for decades. And now they want to flood it with millions of ballots.

And regarding Guantanamo Bay, despite your promise to close it, it remains open. Given reported resistance from within your administration, can you assure the American people that Guantanamo will be closed before you leave office? [SEP] I've consistently stated that closing Guantanamo is a goal for this nation. A major hurdle is the reluctance of other countries to take back detainees. We need a place for these individuals to go. The Senate recently voted overwhelmingly against bringing these prisoners into the country. So, the practical issue is: what do we do with these people? To say nothing has been done is inaccurate. We are actively working with other nations to facilitate the return of detainees. Many of these individuals are dangerous, and countries are hesitant to accept them. We also want to ensure humane treatment upon their return. Another challenge is holding trials. I'm eager to see these trials commence. The courts are involved in determining the process, and the Defense Department is working to establish mechanisms for these trials. The sooner we can get this underway, the better. I can't predict whether Guantanamo will be closed. It's a complex issue. I've set an aspiration. Whether we achieve it remains to be seen.

I firmly believe that the panic surrounding the relationship with China is unwarranted. We experienced an incident that caused some… let's say… confusion.

It's a key focus of our foreign policy, and we're working closely with our partners to send a clear message to Iran that there's a better future available to them.

And you said at that time that we're not going to have talks forever. So here we are nearly 3 years later. Is this it? And did you think you would be here 3 years after those first talks? [SEP] You know, there is no doubt that over the last 3 years, when Iran has engaged in negotiations, there has been hemming and hawing and stalling and avoiding the issues in ways that the international community has concluded were not serious. And my expectations, given the consequences of inaction for them, the severe sanctions that are now being applied, the huge toll it's taking on their economy, the degree of isolation that they're feeling right now, which is unprecedented, they understand that the world community means business.To resolve this issue will require Iran to come to the table and discuss in a clear and forthright way how to prove to the international community that the intentions of their nuclear program are peaceful. They know how to do that. This is not a mystery. And so it's going to be very important to make sure that on an issue like this--there are complexities; it obviously has to be methodical. I don't expect a breakthrough in a first meeting, but I think we will have a pretty good sense fairly quickly as to how serious they are about resolving the issue.And there are steps that they can take that would send a signal to the international community and that are verifiable, that would allow them to be in compliance with international norms, in compliance with international mandates, abiding by the nonproliferation treaty, and provide the world an assurance that they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon.

But isn't there something you took away and that you can offer to your successor about how it's risky in the process of sizing up your Russian counterpart?

I learned that it's important to establish a personal relations with leaders even though you may not agree with them—certain leaders. I'm not going to have a personal relationship with Kim Jong Il, and our relationships are such that that's impossible.But U.S.-Russian relations are important. It's important for stability. It's important for our relations in Europe. And therefore, my advice is to establish a personal relationship with whoever is in charge of foreign policy in Russia. It's in our country's interest to do so.Now, it makes it easier, by the way, when there's a trustworthy relationship to be able to disagree and yet maintain common interests in other areas.

{"sentence": "Q. President Obama and President Xi, I'd like to talk to you about cyber. If I am an American business and I'm being hacked by Chinese pirates who are trying to steal my intellectual property, what firm assurances can you give us today that things are going to get better and when? [SEP] S. did sanction anyone in China, would you respond with sanctions?Also, everyone will kill me if I don't ask: What is your reaction to House Speaker John Boehner's decision to resign? [] Will this make life better or worse for you? Are you concerned it will make it more difficult to avoid a Government shutdown or raise the debt limit? And do you think Boehner could just waive the rules and get immigration reform through before he leaves? Thank you. I'll take them in order. With respect to cyber, this has been a serious discussion between myself and President Xi since we first met in Sunnyland. And the good news, from my perspective, is, is that in the lead-up to and then finalized during our meetings here today, we have, I think, made significant progress in agreeing to how our law enforcement and investigators are going to work together, how we're going to exchange information, how we are going to go after individuals or entities who are engaging in cyber crimes or cyber attacks. And we have jointly affirmed the principle that governments don't engage in cyber espionage for commercial gain against companies. That all I consider to be progress.What I've said to President Xi and what I'd say to the American people is, the question now is, are words followed by actions? And we will be watching carefully to make an assessment as to whether progress has been made in this area.With respect to the various tools that we have to go after those who are attacking our companies or trying to extract trade secrets or data, we have traditional law enforcement tools, but, as I indicated a while back, through executive action, I've also instituted the ability to impose sanctions on individuals or entities where we have proof that they've gone after U.S. companies or U.S. persons.And we did not, at our level, have specific discussions of specific cases. But I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively. Those are tools generally that were—that are not directed at governments; they are directed at entities or individuals that we can identify. And they're not unique to China. Those are tools that we're going to be using for cyber criminals around the world.And President Xi, during these discussions, indicated to me that, with 1.3 billion people, he can't guarantee the behavior of every single person on Chinese soil, which I completely understand. I can't guarantee the actions of every single American. What I can guarantee, though, and what I'm hoping President Xi will show me, is that we are not sponsoring these activities, and that when it comes to our attention that nongovernmental entities or individuals are engaging in this stuff, that we take it seriously and we're cooperating to enforce the law.The last point I'll make on the cyber issue: Because this is a global problem and because, unlike some of the other areas of international cooperation, the rules in this area are not well developed, I think it's going to very important for the United States and China, working with other nations and the United Nations and other—and the private sector, to start developing an architecture to govern behavior in cyberspace that is enforceable and clear. It doesn't mean that we're going to prevent every cyber crime, but it does start to serve as a template whereby countries know what the rules are, they're held accountable, and we're able to jointly go after nonstate actors in this area.On John Boehner, I just heard the news as I was coming out of the meeting here, so it took me by surprise. And I took the time prior to this press conference to call John directly and talk to him.John Boehner is a good man. He is a patriot. He cares deeply about the House, an institution in which he served for a long time. He cares about his constituents, and he cares about America. We have obviously had a lot of disagreements, and politically, we're at different ends of the spectrum. But I will tell you, he has always conducted himself with courtesy and civility with me. He has kept his word when he made a commitment. He is somebody who has been gracious.And I think maybe most importantly, he's somebody who understands that in government, in governance, you don't get a hundred percent of what you want, but you have to work with people who you disagree with—sometimes strongly—in order to do the people's business.I'm not going to prejudge who the next Speaker will be. That's something that will have to be worked through in the House. And I will certainly reach out immediately to whoever is the new Speaker to see what his or her ideas are and how we can make progress in the important issues that America faces.The one thing I will say is that my hope is, there's a recognition on the part of the next Speaker—something I think John understood, even though at times, it was challenging to bring his caucus along—that we can have significant differences on issues, but that doesn't mean you shut down the Government. That doesn't mean you risk the full faith and credit of the United States. You don't invite potential financial crises. You build roads and pass transportation bills. And you do the basic work of governance that ensures that our military is operating and that our national parks are open and that our kids are learning.And there's no weakness in that. There's—that's what government is in our democracy. You don't get what you want a hundred percent of the time. And so sometimes, you take half a loaf; sometimes, you take a quarter loaf. And that's certainly something that I've learned here in this office.So I'm looking forward to working with the next Speaker. In the meantime, John is not going to leave for another 30 days, so hopefully, he feels like getting as much stuff done as he possibly can. And I'll certainly be looking forward to working with him on that. All right? Madam reporter has raised the cybersecurity issue. Indeed, at current, for the international community and for China and the United States, this is an issue all attach great importance to. With President Obama and I have on many occasions—and this is a long history—have exchange of views on this. I think it's fair to say we've reached a lot of consensus on cybersecurity, including some new consensus.Overall, the United States is the strongest country in terms of cyberstrength. China is the world's biggest cyber country in terms of the number of web users. We have more than 600 million of netizens. Our two sides should cooperate because cooperation will benefit both and confrontation will lead to losses on both sides. We are entirely able to carry out government department and expert levels of dialogue and exchanges to strengthen our cooperation in many respects and turn the cybersecurity between the two countries into a new growth source, rather than a point of confrontation between the two sides.China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks. The U.S. side, if has concerns in this respect, we can, through the existing channels, express those concerns. The Chinese side will take seriously the U.S. provision of any information. Now, we have already, and in the future, we will still, through the law enforcement authorities, maintain communication and coordination on this matter and appropriately address them.So, all in all, we have broad, common interests in the field of the cyber.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Libya, you've stated your desire for Qadhafi to relinquish power. Are you prepared to authorize any and all actions by the U.S. government to achieve this? If not, what are the specific limitations, considering the apparent shift in policy compared to other regional uprisings? [SEP] Well, let's be clear about our actions thus far. My immediate concern was the safety of American citizens and embassy staff in Libya, which we successfully addressed. Subsequently, we implemented the most substantial financial asset seizure in our nation's history. Following that, we imposed sanctions and rallied the international community through the UN, progressively tightening the pressure on Qadhafi. He faces increasing international isolation through sanctions and an arms embargo.\n\nFurthermore, we've extended significant humanitarian aid to assist those crossing into Tunisia and Egypt, and we will continue this support. Within NATO, we've initiated discussions on a range of options, from continuous surveillance to monitor the situation and respond swiftly to potential deterioration, to further actions regarding the arms embargo, additional humanitarian assistance, and potential military options, including a no-fly zone.\n\nNATO will convene on Tuesday to consider a no-fly zone, and we've consulted with Arab and African nations to assess their support for such a measure. Additionally, Secretary Clinton will meet with the opposition in the coming days, and we've decided to appoint a representative specifically to engage with the opposition and explore ways to further assist them. We will maintain close communication with them.\n\nIn essence, I haven't ruled out any options at this stage. It's crucial to recognize that we've acted with unprecedented speed in imposing sanctions on Qadhafi through an international coalition. I am unequivocally committed to the notion that Mr. Qadhafi's departure is in the best interest of the United States and, more importantly, the Libyan people. I haven't dismissed any of these options.\n\nHowever, I take seriously the responsibility of ensuring that any decisions involving U.S. military force are carefully considered and made in close consultation with Secretary Gates, Chairman Mullen, and all relevant personnel. Deploying U.S. forces into potentially hostile situations carries inherent risks and consequences, and it is my duty as President to thoroughly assess those risks.\n\nPolitically, it's also vital to maintain the strong international coalition we've established.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, there are many questions regarding the situation in Syria, particularly concerning Russia's involvement. Following your meeting with President Putin, do you believe he was honest about his intentions in Syria? If Russian forces target groups aligned with the U.S. alongside ISIS, will the U.S. military intervene to protect them? Furthermore, considering the setbacks in the U.S. train-and-equip program, can it be salvaged, or should alternative strategies be considered? Specifically, would you entertain the idea of a no-fly zone, as advocated by several presidential hopefuls, including your former Secretary of State? [SEP] Let's be clear, Syria is a complex situation that requires a comprehensive understanding. What began as peaceful protests against Assad transformed into a civil war due to his brutal response. This is not a conflict between the U.S. and any party in Syria; it is a conflict between the Syrian people and a ruthless dictator. Assad remains in power because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process. Putin's actions now are not particularly different from what they have been doing in the past; they are just more overt about it. They are propping up a regime that is rejected by the Syrian population because Assad has been willing to bomb his own people to stay in power. I told Putin that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is through a political transition that is inclusive, keeps the state and military intact, but gets rid of Assad. He is too toxic for Syrians to accept. I offered to work with Putin if he can convince Assad and Iran to agree to this transition. A military solution will not work; it will just get them stuck in a quagmire. We all want to destroy ISIS, but Putin does not distinguish between ISIS and the moderate Sunni opposition. He thinks they are all terrorists, which is wrong. We are talking to Russia to avoid accidental clashes. We still believe Assad is the problem and his brutality must end. We are ready to work with anyone to achieve that, but we will not help Russia crush Assad's opposition. The moderate opposition is key to Syria's future. Russia's actions are weakening them and strengthening ISIS. Our train-and-equip program has not worked as planned, partly because the opposition is too busy fighting Assad to focus on ISIS. We are looking at what has worked, like our work with the Kurds, and building on that. We will also keep working with the opposition because without a change in government, the civil war will continue, fueling ISIS. Putin went into Syria because Assad was crumbling. Sending arms and money was not enough; he had to send in his own forces. Nobody is buying his plan. Iran and Assad are his only allies. We have a coalition of 60 nations. Putin might realize it is in his interest to broker a political settlement. We are ready to work with Russia and Iran on that. It will not be easy, but it is possible. We need to talk, but only if there is a recognition that Assad has to go. We cannot go back to the way things were.

There was a way to have this discussion without that damage. The US abides by the rule of law, cares about privacy, and our Constitution.

Greenspan is suggesting you need Government money to prevent home foreclosures, and Feldstein is suggesting more tax cuts. Should the Government do more, and if so, what? [SEP] Well, we're constantly analyzing options available to us. My view of the economy is that the fundamentals are strong, that we've had strong growth for a reason: that we're competitive; we got flexible workplace; that we kept taxes low; exports are up.Like many Americans, I'm concerned, and I'm concerned about the fact that Americans see their costs going up. I know Americans are concerned about whether or not their neighbor may stay in their house. And so we're dealing with these issues.On the housing front, I made it clear we're not going to bail out lenders, and we're not going to help speculators. But we will help creditworthy people stay in their homes. And that's what Secretary Paulson has done, along with Secretary Jackson, in putting together what's called the HOPE NOW coalition, which has got lenders and financiers and consumer advocates all working together to develop standards to make it more likely a creditworthy person can refinance their home.See, the difficulty we face in the housing market is that the lender, the person who actually made the note, oftentimes doesn't end up owning the note. That note could be—in the recent past has been bundled and sold as an asset. And so there's no telling who owns the mortgage of the person who wants to renegotiate. And so we're helping deal with the new realities in a way that we believe is going to be effective.Secondly, the Congress can really help by passing a FHA modernization bill. The House passed a bill. The Senate passed a bill. They need to get together when they get back, quickly, and get it to my desk so that it makes it easier for the Federal Government, in this case, to help people refinance their homes.In terms of further stimulation, we'll consider all options. And so we're watching carefully.Let's see here. Baker [Peter Baker, Washington Post].", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Do you feel confident you have German support on sectoral sanctions, particularly the energy sector? [SEP] You've got to keep in mind that when it comes to sectoral sanctions, we're looking at a whole range of issues. Energy flows from Russia to Europe, those continued even in the midst of the cold war, at the height of the cold war. So the idea that you're going to turn off the tap on all Russian oil or natural gas exports, I think, is unrealistic. But there are a range of approaches that can be taken not only in the energy sector, but in the arms sector, the finance sector, in terms of lines of credit for trade, all that have a significant impact on Russia.I don't think it's appropriate for us to delve into the details at this stage because our hope is that we don't have to deploy them. But what I can say is, is that our experts at the highest level—and not just bilaterally, but multilaterally through the European Commission and our diplomatic teams—have been working through all the possibilities, and we're confident that we will have a package that will further impact Russia's growth and economy. But again, our hope is, is that we shouldn't have to use them. We're not interested in punishing the Russian people. We do think that Mr. Putin and his leadership circle are taking bad decisions and unnecessary decisions and he needs to be dissuaded from his current course. It is, I think, obvious to all that there are very different assessments on what happens in Ukraine. On the one hand, you have the United States and Europe—we've always taken our decisions together—and on the other hand, the Russian appreciation and appraisal of the situation. I hope that Russia will live up better in the future to its responsibilities. But we need to see deeds matching up their words.We don't have any release of the hostages of the OSCE, among them also four German hostages. This is a very crucial step that needs to happen first. We don't—we have not yet seen any implementation of the Geneva agreement by the Russian side. The Ukrainian side has taken some steps in the right direction. And the OSCE, too, is an organization to which we wish to accord a greater role so that they can prepare and pave the way for elections.And one word on sanctions: I agree with the American President; they are not an end in itself, but combined with the offer that we want diplomatic solutions, it is a very necessary second component to show that we're serious about our principles. And there is a broad base, a broad range of possibilities that are being prepared for in the European Union. In Europe, we have taken a decision that should further destabilization happen, we will move to a third stage of sanctions.I would like to underline: This is not necessarily what we want, but we are ready and prepared to go to such a step. My main aim would be, first and foremost, to improve stabilization and to see to it that the elections can happen there. We will work on this in the next few days, but we are also prepared to take further steps.What we are talking about here will be sectoral measures in the context of certain branches of industry. The American President—and I can only agree to this—has said what is necessary as regards the dependency on gas, which is very strong in Europe, but we can also look ahead, in the medium term, what we can do in order to promote an energy union in the European Union, which we're doing. Looking at our dependencies in the next 10 to 15 years on Russian gas supplies, there are six countries that—right now in the EU—that depend a hundred percent on gas supplies. We need to improve the reverse flow, as we call it. We need to improve our grid of pipelines. All of the countries need to share supplies.

{"sentence": "Q. Part of the process of looking at the way forward could reasonably include considering how we got to where we are. Has that been part of your process? And what lessons—after 5 years now of war, what lessons will you take into the final 2 years of your Presidency? [SEP] Yes, look, absolutely, Jim, that it is important for us to be successful going forward is to analyze that which went wrong. And clearly, one aspect of this war that has not gone right is the sectarian violence inside Baghdad, a violent reaction by both Sunni and Shi'a to each other that has caused a lot of loss of life as well as some movements in neighborhoods inside of Baghdad. It is a troubling, very troubling, aspect of trying to help this Iraqi Government succeed. And therefore, a major consideration of our planners is how to deal with that and how to help—more importantly, how to help the Iraqis deal with sectarian violence.There are a couple of theaters inside of Iraq, war theaters. One, of course, is Baghdad, itself, where the sectarian violence is brutal. And we've got to help them. We've got to help the Maliki Government stop it and crack it and prevent it from spreading, in order to be successful.I fully understand—let me finish. Secondly, is the battle against the Sunnis, Sunni extremists—some of them Saddamists, some of them are Al Qaida— but all of them aiming to try to drive the United States out of Iraq before the job is done. And we're making good progress against them. It's hard fighting. It's been hard work, but our special ops teams, along with Iraqis, are on the hunt and bringing people to justice.There's issues in the south of Iraq, mainly Shi'a-on-Shi'a tensions. But primarily, the toughest fight for this new Government is inside of Baghdad. Most of the deaths, most of the violence is within a 30-mile radius of Baghdad, as well as in Anbar Province. In other words, a lot of the country is moving along positively. But it's this part of the fight that is getting our attention. And frankly, we have—it has been that aspect of the battle, toward a government which can defend and govern itself and be an ally in the war on terror that— where we have not made as much progress as we'd have hoped to have made.Listen, last year started off as an exciting year with the 12 million voters. And the attack on the Samarra mosque was Zarqawi's successful attempt to foment this sectarian violence. And it's mean. It is deadly, and we've got to help the Iraqis deal with it.Success in Iraq will be success—there will be a combination of military success, political success, and reconstruction. And they've got to go hand in hand. That's why I think it's important that the moderate coalition is standing up. In other words, it's the beginning of a political process that I hope will marginalize the radicals and extremists who are trying to stop the advance of a free Iraq. That's why the oil law is going to be a very important piece of legislation.In other words, when this Government begins to send messages that we will put law in place that help unify the country, it's going to make the security situation easier to deal with. On the other hand, without better, stronger security measures, it's going to be hard to get the political process to move forward. And so it's— we've got a parallel strategy. So when you hear me talking about the military—I know there's a lot of discussion about troops, and there should be—but we've got to keep in mind we've also got to make sure we have a parallel political process and a reconstruction process going together concurrently with a new military strategy.I thought it was an interesting statement that Prime Minister Maliki made the other day about generals, former generals in the Saddam army, that they could come back in or receive a pension. In other words, he's beginning to reach out in terms of a reconciliation plan that I think is going to be important.I had interesting discussions the other day with Provincial Reconstruction Team members in Iraq. These are really brave souls who work for the State Department that are in these different Provinces helping these provincial governments rebuild and to see a political way forward. And one of the things that—most of these people were in the Sunni territory, that I had talked to, and most of them were very anxious for me to help them and help the Iraqi Government put reconciliation plans in place. There's a lot of people trying to make a choice as to whether or not they want to support a government or whether or not their interest may lay in extremism. And they understand that a political process that is positive, that sends a signal, We want to be a unified country, will help these folks make a rational choice.And so it's a multifaceted plan.

I can use my executive authorities to improve the existing system, but that won't solve the entire problem. A comprehensive bill is much better, and I hope Republicans want to pass it. On Keystone, there's an independent process moving forward. I'll let it play out, considering if it's good for the American people, their pocketbooks, job creation, gas prices, and climate change. There's a pending case in Nebraska. While the Canadian oil debate rages, American oil and natural gas production have seen significant increases. We're closer to energy independence than ever before, importing less foreign oil. We have a hundred-year supply of natural gas. Our energy sector is booming, and clean energy production is also increasing. Keystone is just one small aspect of a positive trend.

The Prime Minister will make her own decisions. My only concern is ensuring we can trade freely. We're their largest trading partner, and the potential for growth is enormous.

That's why we're working with friends, allies, and concerned parties to gather international support and make it clear to the Iranian people that there's a better option for them.

It is necessary that we do this in advance so that Russia can clearly understand that these are far-reaching, severe measures.It is part of this process that we do not spell out everything in public because Russia could understand that there might be even more to come.

Did this come up, and what's Japan's defense role? [SEP] Thank you. The Prime Minister will be buying lots of military equipment from the U.S., and then he'll shoot them down easily. We shot one down in Saudi Arabia – a needle in the sky, hit immediately. So, Japan's buying massive amounts of equipment from us, the best in the world. F-35, missiles – jobs for us, safety for Japan. My relationship with President Xi is excellent. I like him, he likes me. But he represents China, I represent the U.S. We differ on things, but agree on trade. China's been unfair for decades – a massive trade deficit, $350-$504 billion, not including intellectual property. We're discussing it. It has to come down. It's about free, fair, or reciprocal trade. I like reciprocal best. People understand it. We'll charge the same as they charge us. Some countries charge us 100% tax, we charge them nothing. I'm against that. You'll see action. It takes time – statutory limitations, notices, waiting periods. But the legal foundation is done. You'll see strong action against countries treating us unfairly. It's already started. I view companies as extensions of the worker. Regarding Japan's defense, we buy a lot from the U.S. The North Korean situation is tough, so we need to enhance our defense capability. F-35A, SM-3 Block IIA, Aegis vessels – we'll buy more from the U.S. We traced the North Korean missiles. Missile defense is a U.S.-Japan cooperation.

[SEP] I understand the deep emotions surrounding the history between the United States and Chile. We are committed to working with the Chilean government to provide any information that can shed light on the past. It's crucial to learn from our history, but we must also focus on the present and future.

I need to bridge divisions, overcome gridlock, and get things done. On issues like the minimum wage, voters have directly supported it. The challenge is to find areas of overlap with Republican priorities. There will be disagreements, but I'm committed to reaching out to Republicans, listening to their perspectives, and finding common ground.

{"sentence": "Q. Now, you—I'm sure you're not surprised that some in the military are not supportive of that deal. Some European allies think it would be a deal with the devil. What makes you so confident that you can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin? [SEP] I'm not confident that we can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin, which is why we have to test whether or not we can get an actual cessation of hostilities that includes an end to the kinds of aerial bombing and civilian death and destruction that we've seen carried out by the Asad regime. And Russia may not be able to get there either because they don't want to or because they don't have sufficient influence over Asad. And that's what we're going to test.So we go into this without any blinders on. We're very clear that Russia has been willing to support a murderous regime that has—and an individual, in Asad, who has destroyed his country just to cling on to power. What started with peaceful protests has led to a shattering of an entire and pretty advanced society. And so whenever you're trying to broker any kind of deal with an individual like that or a country like that, you've got to go in there with some skepticism.On the other hand, if we are able to get a genuine cessation of hostilities that prevents indiscriminate bombing, that protects civilians, that allows humanitarian access and creates some sort of pathway to begin the hard work of political negotiations inside of Syria, then we have to try, because the alternative is a perpetuation of civil war.I've been wrestling with this now for a lot of years. I am pretty confident that a big chunk of my gray hair comes out of my Syria meetings. [] And there is not a meeting that I don't end by saying, is there something else we could be doing that we haven't thought of. Is there a plan F, G, H that we think would lead to a resolution of this issue so that the Syrian people can put their lives back together again and we can bring peace and relieve the refugee crisis that's taken place? And the options are limited when you have a civil war like this, when you have a ruler who doesn't care about his people, when you've got terrorist organizations that are brutal and would impose their own kind of dictatorship on people, and you have a moderate opposition and ordinary civilians who are often outgunned and outmanned. And that's a very difficult situation to deal with. But we've got to give it a chance.There are going to be some bottom lines that we expect for us to cooperate with Russia beyond the sort of deconfliction that we're currently doing. And that means restraint on the part of the regime that so far has not been forthcoming.Early on in this version of the cessation of hostilities, we probably saw some lives saved and some lessening of violence. The violations of this cessation have grown to the point where it just barely exists, particularly up in the northwestern part of the country. So we're going to test and see if we can get something that sticks. And if not, then Russia will have shown itself very clearly to be an irresponsible actor on the world stage that is supporting a murderous regime and will have to be—will have to answer to that on the international stage.All right?

However, President Putin and I have discussed this directly, and he's committed to ensuring full cooperation on counterterrorism efforts. Regarding the American people, I believe their response in Boston demonstrated their resilience. We will not be intimidated.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, this communique mentions refraining from competitive currency devaluations. What does that practically mean regarding China's actions, and what do you expect from them? Also, do you believe the Democratic Party would benefit from fresh leadership in Congress? [SEP] From day one, I've been clear that we welcome China's rise. Their remarkable growth has lifted millions out of poverty, which benefits the world and America, as it allows China to be a responsible partner and a vast market for us, Korea, and other nations. It's good to see people escape poverty and gain opportunity. However, China's success demands responsible international behavior. The RMB issue is a source of friction, not just for the US, but for many of China's trading partners who compete globally. It's undervalued, and China intervenes heavily to keep it that way. We've urged China to gradually transition to a market-based system, something they've done before. They also need to shift to a more balanced growth strategy, focusing on their domestic market and empowering their people to consume, boosting their growth and reducing global imbalances. This communique, I believe, signals to China and others that allowing currencies to reflect market fundamentals is the best way to ensure everyone benefits from trade. I expect China to make progress on this. President Hu's visit in January offers an opportunity to continue this progress. This requires adjustments for China, and we understand it won't happen overnight, but it needs addressing, and I'm confident it can be. As for Congress, I believe we'll see talented individuals rise to the top with good ideas on jobs, investment, economic growth, and addressing our challenges.

{"sentence": "What are your thoughts on the Pope recognizing Palestine? Will it aid or impede a two-state solution? [SEP] Well, let me first commend the Senate for granting me the power to negotiate and enforce a progressive trade agreement with nations in the Asia-Pacific and Europe. My gratitude to the Senators who supported the debate's commencement. I will continue to persuade those who dissented. Despite prior issues with trade agreements, my strategy benefits businesses of all sizes and, most importantly, American workers. I would not advocate for any agreement that did not generate employment and enhance wages. My disagreement with Elizabeth is not personal; it is a policy divergence. Many of my allies in the Senate and House disagree with me, and I comprehend their worries about factory closures and overseas job migration. They are concerned about labor and environmental standards, as well as equitable trade practices. They are also concerned about inequality and the consequences of automation and globalization. They share my ideals, save for trade. It is a policy disagreement on what is optimal for our citizens. I contend that we are better off establishing stringent regulations with robust safeguards against child labor, deforestation, and other issues for the world's largest and fastest-growing market. If we do not, China will. Regarding outsourcing, enterprises can already engage in it. We have an opportunity to attract businesses back. Nike is repatriating 10,000 jobs due to technological advancements. We must sell our products there. We require a robust minimum wage, job training, infrastructure investments, collective bargaining, overtime compensation, paid sick leave, and transparent budgets.

I did speak with President-elect Sarkozy soon after he won – around 8:03 Paris time, I think. I'm glad he took my call. I met him before and found him to be smart and energetic. We'll have our differences, but also things we agree on, and I look forward to working with him. As for Cheney's trip, his main point to the Iraqis is that they need to hurry up, especially on passing laws that bring people together. There's a clock ticking here in Washington, and they need to get that. He'll also be talking to other friends in the region about Iran. We know what it would mean if Iran got nuclear weapons, and we're working to build a united front against that. We've already got the EU-3, Russia, and China on board diplomatically, and we need to keep it that way. Cheney will also remind everyone that success in Iraq is key to dealing with Iran.

This encompasses various areas of cooperation: diplomatic, economic, and judicial. A key component is a security agreement, and naturally, they're keen on establishing a timeline for the transition to what we term 'overwatch.' Overwatch entails a U.S. presence focused on training, logistical support, and special operations. Crucially, for our troops to operate in a foreign nation, a clear understanding with the host government is essential, including operational authorities and protections for our personnel. We're diligently negotiating these aspects, aiming for completion before year-end, unless the U.N. mandate is extended.

[SEP] Protest is a fundamental aspect of our democratic system. I have been the target of protests throughout my presidency, as have countless presidents before me. I would not discourage those who feel strongly about the issues raised during the campaign from expressing their views. However, I would emphasize the importance of voting, organizing, and staying informed. We must not take our system of government for granted. Democracy requires constant effort. When a significant portion of eligible voters fail to participate, our democracy is weakened. If we are unable to distinguish between facts and propaganda, we face serious challenges. If individuals are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process, our democracy will erode. It is crucial to understand the foundations of a healthy democracy and to actively participate in citizenship. There is a tendency towards complacency, particularly among younger generations who may not fully appreciate the challenges of the Cold War.

So, there are always folks on the other side, be they Democrats or Republicans, that you can try to work with, maybe peel off a few votes. We'll have to see.

[SEP] I'm not sure about this particular bill, but let's be clear: the FBI *desperately* needs a new building. The existing one is a disaster – old, poorly built, pieces falling off. They looked at locations way outside DC, which I vetoed. They need to be close to Justice. The current site is the best. So, I've been encouraging them to build it. Renovation is a waste; we need a brand-new, top-of-the-line building for the next 100 years, maybe even with a running track on top! It's a huge area. Building new is the only way to go.

He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is—from where I come from—somewhat of a negative force. I think that the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done. So I've decided not to meet.As far as the protests, I have to tell you, because I commented on it yesterday: We left the Prime Minister, the Queen, the Royal Family; there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then, I heard that there were protests. I said: Where are the protests? I don't see any protests. I did see a small protest today when I came, very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love. There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn't see the protesters until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news. Thank you.. And I would say to both the mayor of London and to Jeremy Corbyn: The discussions that we have had today are about the future of this most important relationship between the U.S. and the U.K.As the President described it: the greatest alliance the world has seen. It is this deep, special relationship and partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom that ensures our safety and security, and the safety and security of others around the world too. And it is this relationship that helps to ensure there are jobs that employ people here in the U.K. and in the United States that underpins our prosperity and our future. That is a relationship we should cherish. It is a relationship we should build on. It is a relationship we should be proud of.Mr. President, would you like to—— It's very big, and this really is a very big and important alliance.

A poll came out recently where my numbers with Hispanics and with African Americans are the highest—the best they've ever been. That had—that took place 2 or 3 days ago, the poll. I have the best numbers with African American and Hispanic American that I've ever had before. And you saw the same poll. So I can say that.

This thorough approach has yielded a reasonably tranquil environment. We trust this stability will endure. However, I wish to underscore the enhanced feeling of security among Finnish citizens.

That's your domain. Plenty of folks are happy to speculate; I won't be one of them. On Cuba, we're not about regime change. We're about empowering the Cuban people with freedom and the ability to shape their future, supporting civil society. Cuba will evolve regardless. President Castro referenced pre-my-birth actions; the Cold War is over. We still face challenges with Cuba, including their government's approach to its people and regional issues. But we can cooperate. Cuban doctors helped during Ebola; their work in Haiti after the earthquake was impactful. I told President Castro we'll voice our views, but persuasion is key, especially on issues not directly impacting our national security. Cuba isn't a threat. My concerns are ISIL, Iran's nuclear ambitions, Yemen, Libya, Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine, climate change – a long list.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. Your administration has laid out four different dates by which you've said that the debt ceiling must be raised or the U.S. would face potential dire consequences. Three of those dates have come and gone, and we haven't faced financial calamity. Some of your critics have argued that these are then scare tactics to force a deal. So why should the American people believe that the August 2 deadline is the final deadline by which a deal must be raised? And would you also spell out for us what you believe will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised by that date? [SEP] Jessica, let's be clear. We haven't given out four different dates. We have given out dates that are markers for us getting into trouble. It's the equivalent of you're driving down the street and the red--the yellow light starts flashing. The yellow light is flashing. Now, it hasn't been a red light yet. So what Tim Geithner has said is, technically speaking, we're in a position now where we're having to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that our bills are paid.By August 2, we run out of tools to make sure that all our bills are paid. So that is a hard deadline. And I want everybody to understand that this is a jobs issue. This is not an abstraction. If the United States Government, for the first time, cannot pay its bills, if it defaults, then the consequences for the U.S. economy will be significant and unpredictable. And that is not a good thing.We don't know how capital markets will react. But if capital markets suddenly decide, you know what, the U.S. Government doesn't pay its bills, so we're going to start pulling our money out, and the U.S. Treasury has to start to raise interest rates in order to attract more money to pay off our bills, that means higher interest rates for businesses; that means higher interest rates for consumers. So all the headwinds that we're already experiencing in terms of the recovery will get worse.That's not my opinion. I think that's a consensus opinion. And that means that job growth will be further stymied, it will be further hampered, as a consequence of that decision. So that's point number one.Point number two, I want to address what I've been hearing from some quarters, which is, well, maybe this debt limit thing is not really that serious; we can just pay interest on the debt. This idea has been floating around in some Republican circles.This is the equivalent of me saying, you know what, I will choose to pay my mortgage, but I'm not going to pay my car note. Or I'm going to pay my car note, but I'm not going to pay my student loan. Now, a lot of people in really tough situations are having to make those tough decisions. But for the U.S. Government to start picking and choosing like that is not going to inspire a lot of confidence.Moreover, which bills are we going to decide to pay? These guys have said, well, maybe we just pay the interest on--for bondholders. So are we really going to start paying interest to Chinese who hold Treasurys, and we're not going to pay folks their Social Security checks? Or we're not going to pay to veterans for their disability checks? I mean, which bills, which obligations, are we going to say we don't have to pay?And last point I want to make about this. These are bills that Congress ran up. The money has been spent. The obligations have been made. So this isn't a situation--I think the American people have to understand this--this is not a situation where Congress is going to say, okay, we won't buy this car or we won't take this vacation. They took the vacation. They bought the car. And now they're saying maybe we don't have to pay or we don't have to pay as fast as we said we were going to or--that's not how responsible families act.

The devil's in the details; experts must agree on confidence-building measures and their implementation. Cooperation on a global missile defense system is desirable. If we can cooperate regionally and then globally, that's in our interest. Russia worries the system targets them, so they'll react. I see it as defensive, not offensive. We must convince experts it's not aimed at Russia, but to address common threats. Regarding the Czech Republic and Poland, their leaders must see Russia as a partner, not an enemy. We'll work through differences. Transparency means openness, not just briefings. I'll share technologies and information to show it's for single/dual-launch regimes, not Russia's capacity.

I've personally engaged with numerous leaders, Secretary Rice has been in contact with her counterparts, and Mr. Hadley has also been involved in these discussions. These conversations are ongoing, and I wouldn't want to predict the final outcome. The vote will take place in Bucharest. My presence here should send a clear message that I am serious about this issue, that I truly believe it's in our interest for Ukraine to join NATO. But I hope you'll see more in my visit than just a statement on NATO. I was deeply impressed, as were many Americans, by the Orange Revolution. Many Americans were genuinely moved and encouraged by what transpired here. I conveyed to the President that Ukraine has captured the hearts and minds of many of our citizens over the past decade, and that you will find strong allies in us. The most important thing is to have a government that is open, transparent, free from corruption, and responsive to the needs of its people.

[SEP] Look, the crucial thing is to establish benchmarks that both our government and the Iraqi government can agree on and deem significant. It's imperative for the American people to understand that simply dictating benchmarks to a sovereign nation isn't the most effective approach. We need buy-in from the Iraqi government itself. Our strategy involves collaborating closely with the Maliki Government to develop a series of benchmarks aimed at achieving specific objectives. This is to reassure the Iraqi people that their unity government is committed to improving their lives. It's beneficial for the Iraqi government to demonstrate their intentions and timelines to their people.

We sanctioned their Central Bank today. We'll see what happens. They're facing internal issues and self-inflicted problems. We possess the world's strongest military. Deciding to engage Iran would be simple, the easiest decision. However, I'm exercising significant restraint, which some appreciate, while others urge immediate action. I prioritize the interests of the United States and our allies. It's progressing exceptionally well. Robert O'Brien has excelled in hostage negotiations, achieving unparalleled success. We've swiftly brought numerous individuals home. Speed is crucial in hostage situations. Recently, I dined with the Warmbier family, a remarkable group, honoring Otto's memory. The First Lady and I found it deeply touching. We discussed Otto, emphasizing the need for quicker action. Robert and I agree on this point. With hostages, swift action is paramount. Otherwise, intervention becomes challenging, sometimes too late, as in Otto's case. We secured his return, but his condition was dire. What he endured was horrific. Robert and I have achieved considerable success. I actively engage in hostage situations, unlike many presidents. These are exceptional American lives, and we assist other nations too.

And how important is the Kyoto Protocol to addressing climate change? [SEP] Well, let's start with Kyoto. And remind me of the first part of that question again, I'm getting old. Kyoto might be right for some, but it wasn't for us. I was honest about that. And before I even got to Washington, the Senate voted 95-0 against it. So, it wasn't just me. We went a different way, focusing on new technologies and energy efficiency. And guess what? We cut greenhouse gases while our economy grew. Not many countries can say that. We also want to be less reliant on foreign oil. That might scare some exporters, but we've got a plan to cut gasoline use by 20% in 10 years using ethanol and new tech. Batteries are getting better too. The key is getting these technologies out there. Kyoto didn't do that for us. If you look at who's meeting the Kyoto targets, you might see our approach makes more sense. We rejected it because we wanted to grow our economy, be energy independent, and protect the environment. John and I agree on climate change being important. I also told the G-8 we need everyone at the table, including China and India. If they feel forced into something, they'll walk away, and we can't solve this without them. The Prime Minister is smart to cut tariffs on clean coal tech for China. We support that. The big questions are: How fast can we get these technologies out there, and can we help developing nations get them too? Otherwise, it won't work.

{"sentence": "Q. Do you think that we are actually far from that point right now? And is it realistic to try to broker a cease-fire right now when there are still tunnel operations allowed to continue? Is that going to cause a change of approach from this point forward? [SEP] Well, keep in mind that the cease-fire that had been agreed to would have given Israel the capability to continue to dismantle these tunnel networks, but the Israelis can dismantle these tunnel networks without going into major population centers in Gaza. So I think the Israelis are entirely right that these tunnel networks need to be dismantled. There is a way of doing that while still reducing the bloodshed. You are right that in past conflicts, sometimes, people have to feel deeply the costs. Anybody who has been watching some of these images, I'd like to think, should recognize the costs. You have children who are getting killed. You have women, defenseless, who are getting killed. You have Israelis whose lives are disrupted constantly and living in fear. And those are costs that are avoidable if we're able to get a cease-fire that preserves Israel's ability to defend itself and gives it the capacity to have an assurance that they're not going to be constantly threatened by rocket fire in the future and, conversely, an agreement that recognizes the Palestinian need to be able to make a living and the average Palestinian's capacity to live a decent life.But it's hard. It's going to be hard to get there. I think that there's a lot of anger and there's a lot of despair, and that's a volatile mix. But we have to keep trying.And it is—Bill asked earlier about American leadership. Part of the reason why America remains indispensable, part of the essential ingredient in American leadership is that we're willing to plunge in and try, where other countries don't bother trying. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that in all these crises that have been mentioned, there may be some tangential risks to the United States. In some cases, as in Iraq and ISIS, those are dangers that have to be addressed right now, and we have to take them very seriously. But for the most part, these are not—the rockets aren't being fired into the United States. The reason we are concerned is because we recognize we've got some special responsibilities.We have to be—have some humility about what we can and can't accomplish. We have to recognize that our resources are finite, and we're coming out of a decade of war and our military has been stretched very hard, as has our budget. Nevertheless, we try. We go in there, and we make an effort.And when I see John Kerry going out there and trying to broker a cease-fire, we should all be supporting him. There shouldn't be a bunch of complaints and second-guessing about, well, it hasn't happened yet, or nitpicking before he's had a chance to complete his efforts. Because, I tell you what, there isn't any other country that's going in there and making those efforts.And more often than not, as a consequence of our involvement, we get better outcomes: not perfect outcomes, not immediate outcomes, but we get better outcomes. And that's going to be true with respect to the Middle East. That's going to be true with respect to Ukraine. That's going to be certainly true with respect to Iraq.And I think it's useful for me to end by just reminding folks that, in my first term, if I had a press conference like this, typically, everybody would want to ask about the economy and how come jobs weren't being created? And how come the housing market is still bad? And why isn't it working? Well, you know what, what we did worked. And the economy is better. And when I say that we've just had 6 months of more than 200,000 jobs that hasn't happened in 17 years, that shows you the power of persistence. It shows you that if you stay at it, eventually, we make some progress. All right?", "label": "Dodging"}

You saw what happened in—Kaitlan—in Virginia. It was, you know, 500,000 applications coming in, going all over the State; nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. It was a basic disaster. And you see Paterson, New Jersey, what's going on there. And we can give you many other locations and sites.What has happened is that's part of a big negotiation. That's a—actually small part of a big negotiation to get more money to people that it wasn't their fault; it was China's fault. And Post Office is part of it. Another part of it is, they want $3½ billion just for the ballots themselves. Why it's so much, I don't know. But that's what the Democrats want. But if the bill isn't going to get done, that would mean the Post Office isn't going to get funded, and that would also mean that the $3½ billion dollars isn't going to be taken care of. So I don't know how you can possibly use these ballots, these mail-in ballots.Absentee ballots, by the way, are fine.

How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here? [SEP] Let's be clear, Chelsea Manning served a significant prison sentence. It's not as if leaking classified information goes unpunished. The sentence she received was very disproportionate to what other leakers have received. She went to trial, due process was carried out, and she took responsibility for her crime. I felt it made sense to commute her sentence, not pardon it. Justice has been served, and a message has been sent that national security is paramount. People with concerns about government actions should use established channels and whistleblower protections. I recognize some think these aren't enough, but we need to balance accountability with the safety of those in the field. With respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. I haven't commented on WikiLeaks generally. The intelligence community's conclusions on Russian hacking and WikiLeaks were not conclusive. I don't pay attention to Assange's tweets. I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations. In this cyber age, we need to balance accountability, openness, and transparency with national security.

Did your conversations with President Zardari result in any advancement regarding the reopening of supply routes? And if the broader issues with Pakistan are not resolved, will NATO's achievements in Afghanistan be at risk? [SEP] Look, my discussion with President Zardari was brief, but I reiterated our public and private stance: Pakistan is part of the solution in Afghanistan. A democratic, prosperous, and stable Pakistan is in our national interest. We share a common enemy in extremists in both countries, and we must address the tensions arising from our decade-long military presence. President Zardari believes these issues can be resolved. We didn't expect the supply line issue to be resolved here, but we're making progress. Everyone in the alliance and Afghanistan understands that security, stability, and prosperity require resolving these issues and joining the international community to prevent extremism. There are real challenges and tensions between ISAF, the US, and Pakistan, but they are being addressed through military and diplomatic channels. Ultimately, a successful, stable Pakistan is in our interest, and it's in Pakistan's interest to work with us to prevent extremism. We're committed to this, and every NATO/ISAF member is too.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, a year from now, do you believe Assad will still be in power in Syria? [SEP] For Syria to move forward and stop the bloodshed, Assad needs to go. He's lost legitimacy with most of the country. But, how do we build a bridge for a political transition that protects the interests of Assad's allies, like Russia and Iran, and ensures minorities like the Alawites aren't crushed? That's the tough part. If Assad had put his country first, this would be easier. Now, it's harder. But John Kerry is doing great work.

They know they might need to adapt, but they want a fair shake.\n\nMost Americans still support trade, but they want to know it's fair, that we're not getting taken advantage of. They don't want to see wages go down.\n\nI tried to explain that TPP would help with that, but it's a tough sell when people have seen jobs disappear. So, this election was about wanting a change. People want to control immigration and avoid unfair trade deals. But we need to make sure immigration is legal and orderly, because it's good for our economy. It keeps us young and dynamic.\n\nAnd when it comes to trade, it's not as simple as just cutting things off. We have global supply chains. Auto plants rely on parts from Mexico. So, we need to address people's concerns with things like a higher minimum wage, stronger worker protections, and financial regulations. We need trade that ensures fair labor practices and addresses inequality. That's how we make sure everyone benefits.", "label": "Deflection"}

So, there are many constituencies, traditionally Republican-leaning, who support this. If people want an excuse not to do the right thing, they'll find one. But I assume people want to do what's right. This would strengthen borders, improve the legal system, penalize employers who hire undocumented workers, and allow those here illegally to get right with the law – pay a fine, learn English, and get to the back of the line. It's a sensible law, so we shouldn't look for excuses not to pass it. I'll keep pushing. Will I have to rebuild confidence? Yes. But that's part of the job.

[SEP] I'm racking my brain trying to recall if I specifically ordered an investigation. I don't immediately recall doing so. However, I do recall expressing some frustration regarding the persistent leaks. While I acknowledge the media's role in disseminating information, the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents is unacceptable. It's a recurring issue, not just for this administration, but for any administration attempting to implement policy. We've experienced numerous leaks, and pinpointing the source is often elusive.

[SEP] I've made it abundantly clear to everyone involved that diplomacy should always be the first resort. And the most effective way to achieve a diplomatic solution is for the United States to collaborate with other nations to send a unified message: continued enrichment will lead to isolation and economic hardship. As you may recall, I worked closely with Vladimir Putin on this matter. When asked at a press conference whether Iran should have a civilian nuclear program, I said, 'Of course, but they can't be trusted to enrich.' Therefore, I agreed with Russia's offer to provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power program and then collect the spent uranium, eliminating the need for the Iranian regime to enrich at all.

His politics within his caucus are very difficult, you're right. And this is part of the problem with a political process where folks are rewarded for saying irresponsible things to win elections or obtain short-term political gain, when we actually are in a position to try to do something hard we haven't always laid the groundwork for. And I think that it's going to take some work on his side, but look, it's also going to take some work on our side, in order to get this thing done.I mean, the vast majority of Democrats on Capitol Hill would prefer not to have to do anything on entitlements, would prefer frankly not to have to do anything on some of these debt and deficit problems. And I'm sympathetic to their concerns, because they're looking after folks who are already hurting and already vulnerable, and there are a lot of families out there and seniors who are dependant on some of these programs.And what I've tried to explain to them is, number one, if you look at the numbers, then Medicare in particular will run out of money, and we will not be able to sustain that program no matter how much taxes go up. I mean, it's not an option for us to just sit by and do nothing. And if you're a progressive who cares about the integrity of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and believes that it is part of what makes our country great that we look after our seniors and we look after the most vulnerable, then we have an obligation to make sure that we make those changes that are required to make it sustainable over the long term.And if you're a progressive that cares about investments in Head Start and student loan programs and medical research and infrastructure, we're not going to be able to make progress on those areas if we haven't gotten our fiscal house in order.So the argument I'm making to my party is, the values we care about--making sure that everybody in this country has a shot at the American Dream and everybody is out there with the opportunity to succeed if they work hard and live a responsible life, and that Government has a role to play in providing some of that opportunity through things like student loans and making sure that our roads and highways and airports are functioning, and making sure that we're investing in research and development for the high-tech jobs of the future--if you care about those things, then you've got to be interested in figuring out how do we pay for that in a responsible way.And so yes, we're going to have a sales job; this is not pleasant. It is hard to persuade people to do hard stuff that entails trimming benefits and increasing revenues.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, a year ago, after the Democrats took control of Congress, you expressed a desire for bipartisan cooperation. However, your assessment of the Democrats today was quite critical. How do you evaluate your own performance in working with the Democrats over the past year? How effective have you been in finding common ground, and do you believe you've succeeded in fostering cooperation? [SEP] We're finding common ground on Iraq. I realize some in Congress believe we shouldn't have been there, but the debate seems to have shifted. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker's testimony resonated with many members. I hope we continue to find common ground by ensuring our troops are funded. We found common ground on FISA. My only question is, why change a good law? The current law works for national security, which is what the American people want. This law allows our intelligence professionals to understand Al Qaeda's intentions. The law needs to be enhanced by providing liability protection to phone companies that allegedly assisted us. So, we found common ground there. Hopefully, we can find common ground as Congress moves forward with legislation. The reason I spoke as I did today is that there's much to be done. As you know, I'm not a legislator, but as head of the executive branch, it makes sense to urge Congress to show progress and achieve results. It's hard to find common ground when important bills aren't moving. Not even one appropriations bill has reached my desk. How can you find common ground without an appropriations process? We found common ground on trade bills, which are very important. Exports helped us overcome the weakness in the housing market last quarter. If that's the case, it makes sense to continue opening up markets to goods and services. Yet, no trade bills have been moving. Veterans Affairs is another area for common ground. I asked Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead a commission to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve. I was concerned about bureaucratic delays and a system that didn't recognize the nature of the war we're fighting. I don't like meeting wives at their husbands' bedsides in Walter Reed who aren't being supported by the government. I'm concerned about PTSD and want people to focus on it.

That it took so long to fix is incredible. And they only went in because they knew we were going in the next day, and they didn't want to be embarrassed. The people just gave up, they were exhausted from having their city taken over for so long. The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent.

And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job. So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.

And so, in addition to that, there is now another $10 billion for testing of students in the schools.So I think, as time goes on, it's much more likely you're going to see that number go back up from 95 percent, back up to 98, 99 percent.But the outfit of the individuals of the district that says We're not going to be open is always going to get—and I'm not being critical of any of you—it's always going to get front page.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given Prime Minister Najib's alleged corruption and human rights abuses, what specific concerns did you raise with him regarding the investment funds scandal and the jailing of his political opponents during your meeting? [SEP] Well, with regards to the refugee issue, the Paris attacks were recent. Things move so quickly that we forget. People are concerned, given the similarities between Paris and American cities. That explains the House legislation. I hope people realize that refugees are the most vetted individuals to arrive in the US. The process takes 18-24 months. The House legislation gums up the works and effectively ends the refugee program. Regarding Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on ongoing investigations, especially in foreign countries. However, I emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and rooting out corruption, which are impediments to development. I also emphasized the importance of civil society and a free press. Every country is at different stages of development, and we don't expect everyone to follow the US path. But there are basic principles we should uphold. Take Myanmar, for example, which just had a historic election after 40 years of military rule. They won't be Sweden immediately, but there's a sea change. We want to encourage that. The Open Government Partnership, the bilateral work, the principles in TPP, all raise the bar. Some will go forward, some will slip back, but the trajectory is the same: a world where people are treated fairly, there's rule of law, transparency, governments are accountable, people's voices are heard, women are treated equally, and minorities are not discriminated against.

[SEP] I disagree with your premise that there's no politics taking place in Iraq. There is a functioning government. They passed a budget last year, and they're in the process of passing their budget this year. I am pleased to report that there's been two readings of a de-Ba'athification law to the Council of Assemblies. Bill, if you're trying to judge the Iraqi parliament based upon our own Congress's ability to get bills done, I'd be a little careful. It took our Congress till the last minute to get things done. The legislative process is not all that smooth at times. And they've got a lot of work to do; don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting that we shouldn't, as a government, continue to press them. What I am suggesting, though, there is a functioning government. Your statement was, security didn't provide room for a government to stand up and function. Well, it's happening. And so therefore we will continue to press them on de-Ba'ath law, Provincial election laws, power sharing with the central government and the provinces, and oil law.

[SEP] Allow me to address the initial component of your inquiry. You know, I'm often the subject of jest for asserting that politics is, at its core, a personal endeavor. It hinges on the act of looking someone directly in the eye. And I convey that sentiment with utmost sincerity. There exists no viable substitute for engaging with an individual, be they a friend or an adversary, in a face-to-face setting. That is precisely the nature of our present undertaking. We have engaged in such interactions previously, and we shall persist in doing so. With the advent of winter, Putin is intensifying his targeting of civilian populations, encompassing women, children, and orphanages. This individual... well... he is destined for failure. He has already failed, for he now recognizes the impossibility of fully occupying Ukraine and the Ukrainian people's unwavering rejection of his presence. He has experienced failure in the past, and it is imperative that he and all others recognize the united front presented by President Zelenskyy and myself in ensuring his ultimate defeat. I operate under the conviction – though I acknowledge the potential for error – that I evaluate every leader based on their pronouncements, their consistency, and their willingness to engage in direct eye contact. This individual, in the very depths of his being, embodies the persona he projects. It is unequivocally evident that he stands prepared to sacrifice his life for his nation and all those who accompany him today.

I strived to foster understanding about the historical burdens of race, urging Americans to truly listen to one another. The echoes of slavery, Jim Crow, and discrimination didn't magically disappear with landmark legislation or my election. Progress has been made, certainly, but we have much further to go.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, does the United States intend to maintain permanent military bases in Iraq?

[SEP] Jim, any decisions regarding the long-term presence in Iraq will be made by the Iraqi government. They are focused on ensuring success in the short term and require our assistance. That's where our focus lies. Remember, we are dealing with a sovereign government. We have agreements with the Karzai government that outline arrangements to ensure a U.S. presence as long as they desire it. We will discuss the long-term security of Iraq at the appropriate time. Currently, our focus is on securing Baghdad and addressing Al Qaeda's violent activities in Al Anbar Province. It's important to note that the perception of widespread sectarian conflict across Iraq is inaccurate. General Casey reported that 90% of the action occurs in 5 of the 18 provinces, primarily within a 30-mile radius around Baghdad. Despite the brutal environment depicted on television, normal life continues for many Iraqis. Farmers are farming, small businesses are growing, the currency is relatively stable, and there is an entrepreneurial class. General Abizaid described bustling markets in Baghdad.

{"sentence": "Q. But when is that happening? [SEP] Well, we're going to be in discussions over the next several months. I mean, this is going to be a negotiation process. And the key thing that, I think, the American people want to see is that all sides are serious about it and all sides are willing to give a little bit and that there's a genuine spirit of compromise as opposed to people being interested in scoring political points.Now, we did that in December during the lame duck on the tax cut issue. Both sides had to give. And there were folks in my party who were not happy, and there were folks in the Republican Party who were not happy. And my suspicion is, is that we're going to be able to do the same thing if we have that same attitude with respect to entitlements.But the thing I want to emphasize is, nobody is more mindful than me that entitlements are going to be a key part of this issue, as is tax reform. I want to simplify rates. And I want to, at the same time, make sure that we have the same amount of money coming in as going out.Those are big, tough negotiations, and I suspect that there's going to be a lot of ups and downs in the months to come before we finally get to that solution. But just as a lot of people were skeptical about us being able to deal with the tax cuts that we did in December, but we ended up getting it done, I'm confident that we can get this done as well.Now, with respect to the situation in the Middle East, obviously, there's still a lot of work to be done in Egypt itself, but what we've seen so far is positive. The military council that is in charge has reaffirmed its treaties with countries like Israel and international treaties. It has met with the opposition, and the opposition has felt that it is serious about moving towards fair and free elections. Egypt is going to require help in building democratic institutions and also in strengthening an economy that's taken a hit as a consequence of what happened. But so far at least, we're seeing the right signals coming out of Egypt.There are ramifications, though, throughout the region. And I think my administration's approach is the approach that jibes with how most Americans think about this region, which is that each country is different, each country has its own traditions. America can't dictate how they run their societies, but there are certain universal principles that we adhere to. One of them is, we don't believe in violence as a way of--and coercion--as a way of maintaining control. And so we think it's very important that in all the protests that we're seeing in--throughout the region that governments respond to peaceful protesters peacefully.The second principle that we believe in strongly is in the right to express your opinions, the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly that allows people to share their grievances with the government and to express themselves in ways that, hopefully, will over time meet their needs.And so we have sent a strong message to our allies in the region saying, let's look at Egypt's example as opposed to Iran's example. I find it ironic that you've got the Iranian regime pretending to celebrate what happened in Egypt when, in fact, they have acted in direct contrast to what happened in Egypt by gunning down and beating people who were trying to express themselves peacefully in Iran.And I also think that an important lesson--and I mentioned this last week--that we can draw from this is real change in these societies is not going to happen because of terrorism; it's not going to happen because you go around killing innocents; it's going to happen because people come together and apply moral force to a situation. That's what garners international support. That's what garners internal support. That's how you bring about lasting change.Patricia Zengerle [Reuters].", "label": "Explicit"}

And doesn't the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae set a dangerous precedent, suggesting that some institutions are too big to fail and encouraging excessive risk-taking? [SEP] Let's start with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many Americans may not fully grasp their importance to the mortgage markets. It's crucial to maintain confidence and stability in these markets. That's why Secretary Paulson proposed a plan this weekend, seeking congressional authorization for a line of credit and the authority to invest capital, if necessary. The goal was to reassure the public about the importance of these institutions and to calm any anxieties. By outlining this plan, we reduce the likelihood of needing to use this temporary authority. Now, regarding commercial banks, deposits in American commercial banks are insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. Therefore, if you hear concerns about a bank's condition, depositors should know that the FDIC guarantees their deposits up to $100,000. As a depositor, you are protected by the Federal Government. I once witnessed a bank run in Midland, Texas. I'll never forget the person in the bank lobby saying, \"Your deposits are safe. You're insured.\" But people were too nervous to listen.

Korea and the United States share values like democracy and human rights, which are important for securing supply chains with like-minded nations. That's why we're addressing economic security. Our respective National Security Councils are authorized to handle these issues, and we'll cooperate closely to resolve any challenges. We'll also work together to address potential shocks in financial and foreign exchange markets, further strengthening our economic and military security. We aim to negotiate agreements to promote cooperation in specific areas, such as defense exports. This isn't just talk; it's an active alliance. We're committed to strengthening our alliance further. We advocate for democracy, human rights, and freedom, and while we aim to include countries that don't share these values in the pursuit of world peace, we encourage them to embrace these universal principles. Our goal is to foster solidarity and cooperation among like-minded nations.", "label": "General"}

And can the train-and-equip program be salvaged, or should we consider a no-fly zone? [SEP] Look, the situation in Syria is complex. It began with peaceful protests against Assad, which were met with brutal force, leading to a civil war. This isn't about the U.S. versus anyone in Syria; it's about the Syrian people versus a dictator. Russia and Iran have supported Assad throughout, so their current actions aren't new, just more overt. I told Putin that the only solution is a political transition that includes everyone but Assad. I'm willing to work with Russia if they can broker this transition, but a military solution won't work. We also have a common interest in defeating ISIS, but Putin doesn't distinguish between ISIS and the moderate opposition, which is a mistake. We're having technical talks to avoid conflict in the air. As for our support of opposition groups, we need them for a future political transition. The train-and-equip program hasn't worked as planned because they're focused on Assad's attacks. We're looking at what has worked, like our work with the Kurds. Putin's intervention in Syria is a sign of weakness, not strength. His coalition consists of Iran and Assad, while ours is the rest of the world. We're prepared to work with Russia and Iran on a political transition, but it requires a change in government.

[SEP] [] I've got to tell you, Julie, that's not how I think about it. I have now been in office 5 years—close to 5 years—was running for President for 2 years before that, and for those of you who have covered me during that time, we have had ups, and we have had downs. I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences. And what I've been focused on each and every day is, are we moving the ball in helping the American people, families, have more opportunity, have a little more security to feel as if, if they work hard, they can get ahead?And if I look at this past year, there are areas where there obviously have been some frustrations, where I wish Congress had moved more aggressively. Not passing background checks in the wake of Newtown is something that I continue to believe was a mistake. But then, I also look at because of the debate that occurred, all the work that's been done at State levels to increase gun safety and to make sure that we don't see tragedies like that happen again.There's a lot of focus on legislative activity at the congressional level, but even when Congress doesn't move on things they should move on, there are a whole bunch of things that we're still doing. So we don't always get attention for it, but the ConnectEd program that we announced, where we're going to be initiating wireless capacity in every classroom in America, will make a huge difference for kids all across this country and for teachers.A manufacturing hub that we set up in Youngstown, and something that I talked about during the State of the Union, is going to create innovation and connect universities, manufacturers, job training, to help create a renaissance—build on the renaissance that we're seeing in manufacturing.When it comes to energy, this year is going to be the first year in a very long time where we're producing more oil and natural gas here in this country than we're importing.

If you do, how do you intend to use it? [SEP] First of all, we've had a great trip, Ed [Edwin Chen, Los Angeles Times]. It's a chance for America to talk about a liberty agenda and a chance to talk to our allies about how we can advance it and what we can do together to make our respective countries better off.Listen, the immigration debate is a tough debate. I'm under no illusions about how hard it is. There are people in my party that don't want a comprehensive bill; there are people in the Democrat Party that don't seem to want a comprehensive bill. I was disappointed that the bill was temporarily derailed.I frankly find it interesting that a so-called important subject they need to get to would be to pass a political resolution on my Attorney General that's going to have no bearing on whether he serves in office or not.I believe we can get an immigration bill. Now, it's going to require leadership from the Democrat leaders in the Senate, and it's going to require me to stay engaged and work with Republicans who want a bill.Last—earlier in this trip, I called three members of the Senate from the Republican Party and said: What can we do together to get the bill back up? What do we need to do to work with Senators like Senator Ted Kennedy, who is strongly committed to a comprehensive bill? And tomorrow I'll be going to the Senate to talk about a way forward on the piece of legislation.It's important that we address this issue now. And I believe we can get it done. Listen, there was—a lot of progress was made between people in both parties making hard decisions necessary to move a comprehensive plan. It's in the Nation's interest to get a comprehensive bill done. So the political process sometimes isn't pretty to look at it. There's two steps forward, one step back.

And also, are you willing to accept any consequences for benchmarks in the war funding bill? [SEP] You know, I meet with a lot of people on the subject of Iraq, and I should. There's a lot of opinions on both sides of the aisle about this issue. And my message to the Members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let's make sure our troops get funded, and let's make sure politicians don't tell our commanders how to conduct operations. Let's don't hamstring our people in the field. That's my message.Their message to me has been, you know, don't you think the Iraqi Government ought to do more? They recognize what I recognize, and these gentlemen up here particularly recognize: that without political progress, it's going to be hard to achieve a military victory in Iraq. In other words, the military can provide security so a political process can go forward.Look, the two questions you asked: One was about General Petraeus's report to the—back—around September about what's taking place in Baghdad. My attitude toward Congress is, why don't you wait and see what he says? Fund the troops, and let him come back and report to the American people. General Petraeus picked this date. He believes that there will be enough progress one way or the other to be able to report to the American people, to give an objective assessment about what he sees regarding the Baghdad security plan.It's at that point in time that I'm confident that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs will take a look at what David Petraeus says and make recommendations about troop levels based upon the conditions on the ground, which stands in stark contrast to Members of Congress who say, we're going to determine troop levels based upon politics or the latest opinion poll or how we can get our Members elected.And the second part of your question was about benchmarks. Look, let me talk about this recent effort by Congress to fund our troops. The idea that the House of Representatives put forward is one that we will fund our troops by piecemeal. Secretary Gates was very strong about why that's a bad idea. And the American people must understand that if you fund our troops every 2 months, you're in a—put in a position where we have to delay certain procurement, or that military contracts must be delayed. There's a lot of uncertainty in funding when it comes to 2-month cycles. So we reject that idea. It won't work.I find it odd that the Congress is—I find it ironic that the Congress is ready to fully fund unrelated domestic spending items and only one-half of the money requested for our troops. They provide 100 percent of the money for the special interest projects that—they don't have anything to do with fighting the war on terror, and 50 percent of the money to go to those who wear our uniform. They got it wrong. They ought to provide 100 percent of the money for people who wear the uniform and leave these special pork projects out of the bill. The—and so I'll veto the bill if it's this haphazard, piecemeal funding. And I made that clear.One message I have heard from people from both parties and—is that the idea of benchmarks makes sense. And I agree. It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward. And so I've empowered Josh Bolten to find common ground on benchmarks, and he will continue to have dialog with both Republicans and Democrats.You know, this bill—I believe we can get a good supplemental, and I hope it's as quick as possible. The first blush is the bad supplemental coming out of the House. Nevertheless, there is—the Senate will have a say, and then there will be a conference committee, and hopefully, we can move a good bill forward as quickly as possible.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. What is your response to critics who say the $400 million in cash that you sent to Iran was a ransom payment? Was it really simply a pure coincidence that a sum that was—a payment that was held up for almost four decades was suddenly sent at the exact same time that the American prisoners were released? And can you assure the American people that none of that money went to support terrorism? [SEP] Okay. The—it's been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January, many months ago. There wasn't a secret. Right? We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn't some nefarious deal. And at the time, we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it's interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one.Point number two: We do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out.But those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world—even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families—families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom—defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't—we won't in the future, precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups.Point number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.John Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised—it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal—and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community—the country that was most opposed to this deal—that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [] Now, that would be a shock. [] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity.

I take Bibi Netanyahu—when he gives me his word, I take him at his word. He's never broken his word to me.And—but what I've made clear is that it's essential—it's essential—that the Palestinians in—on the West Bank be secured, that Abbas be recognized as a leader of the Palestinian people, which he is. Hamas is a terrorist organization; we've recognized that. But that doesn't mean we should not be in Gaza, rebuilding Gaza for all those innocent people who in fact have been hurt and had been collateral damage, including loss of home and a whole range of other things—as well as insisting that Israeli citizens, whether they be Arab or Jew, are treated equally as Israeli citizens. And that's what was going on in Jerusalem.And so that has to come to an end. And Bibi know—the Prime Minister knows my views and—but the commitment that was given had—was immediately kept. I—from the very beginning, I told him what our objective was: that there needed to be a cease-fire. And he, in fact, kept his commitment in the timeframe in which he said he would do it. Thank you.And by the way, I wasn't the only one that spoke to him. We had—I look down here—every major player on my team—from the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, all the way down the line, and our National Security Adviser, were in constant contact with their counterparts in Israel, in Egypt, and throughout the Middle East.This was not something that was just done with a casual conversation between myself and Bibi. I have—presumptuous of me to say this but, Mr. President—but I think I've got a great team. And the—and I spent a lot of time with Elsisi on the phone in—in Egypt. And they've done a commendable job of bringing Hamas to the table and getting them to agree to a cease-fire as well. Thank you.Is that it? I think there's one more question over here. Yes. A lady? Our ladies do not raise their hands? Do we not have female journalists from Korea?", "label": "Explicit"}

How comfortable are you—sir, how comfortable are you with your Homeland Security Secretary saying, in the face of no credible intelligence of an imminent threat against the United States, that he has a gut feeling that one is coming this summer? And, sir, what does your gut tell you? [SEP] My gut tells me that— which my head tells me as well—is that when we find a credible threat, I'll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland. My head also tells me that Al Qaida is a serious threat to our homeland, and we've got to continue making sure we've got good intelligence, good response mechanisms in place; that we've got to make sure we don't embolden them with—by failing in certain theaters of war where they're confronting us; that we ought to continue to keep the pressure on them. We need to chase them down and bring them to justice before they come home to hurt us again.And so it's a—this is a serious issue that is going to outlast my Presidency. As I say, this is the beginning stages of what I believe is a ideological conflict that—where you've got a competing visions about what the world ought to be like. What makes this more difficult than previous conflicts is that there's the asymmetrical use of power. In other words, IEDs and suicide bombers are the main tactical device used by these thugs to try to achieve strategic objectives.Their objective is to impose their vision on the world. Their objective is to drive the United States out of parts of the world. They want safe haven. They love a society where women have no rights, just like the society that they worked to impose with the Taliban on the women of Afghanistan. That's their vision. And it's in our interests to defend ourselves by staying on the offense against them. And it's in our interest to spread an alternative ideology.We have done this before in our Nation's history. We have helped people realize the blessings of liberty, even though they may have been our enemy. And freedom has an amazing way of helping lay the foundation for peace. And it's really important, as we head into this ideological struggle in the 21st century, that we not forget that liberty can transform societies.Now, the interesting debate is whether or not a nation like Iraq can self-govern, whether or not these people even care about liberty. As you've heard me say before, I believe, strongly believe that freedom is a universal value, that freedom isn't just for Americans or Methodists, that freedom is universal in its application. And so when they voted in '05, I wasn't surprised; I was pleased that the numbers were as big as they were, to defy that many threats and car bombers, but I wasn't surprised.And this is the real challenge we face. And Iraq is just a part of a broader war against these jihadists and extremists, Mark. It is a—this—we will be dealing with this issue for a while, just like we dealt with other ideologies for a while. It takes time for ideologies to take root.I firmly believe that you'll see the democracy movement continue to advance throughout the Middle East if the United States doesn't become isolationist. That's why I've told you that I'm making sure that we continue to stay diplomatically involved in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will be traveling there in early August to continue to remind our friends and allies that we're—one, we view them as strategic partners, and secondly, that we want them to work toward a freer societies and to help this Iraqi Government survive. It's in their interests that Iraq become a stable partner.And I believe we can achieve that objective. And not only do I believe we can achieve; I know we've got to achieve the objective, so we will have done our duty. This is hard work. And one of the things I talked about in the opening comments was, do we do it now, or basically pull back, let the Gallup Poll, or whatever poll there are, decide the fate of the country? And my view is, is that if that were to happen, we would then have to go back in with greater force in order to protect ourselves, because one of the facts of the 21st century is that what happens overseas matters to the security of our country.Ed.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Sir, many are worried about the stability of our financial institutions. Does the recent intervention with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac create a moral hazard, signaling that recklessness will be rewarded with taxpayer bailouts? [SEP] Regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I want to emphasize their critical role in the housing market. It's vital that Americans have faith in the mortgage system. Secretary Paulson's proposal, which requires congressional approval for a line of credit and potential capital investment, aims to achieve this. The intention is to reassure the public about the importance of these entities and to alleviate concerns. By presenting this plan, we diminish the chances of needing to utilize this temporary measure. Turning to commercial banks, it's important to remember that deposits are insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. If there are rumors about a bank's health, depositors should be aware that the FDIC backs their deposits up to $100,000. As a depositor, you have the protection of the Federal Government. I recall a bank run in Midland, Texas, where someone tried to reassure people about their insured deposits, but fear prevailed.

You in the press are good at finding information and publishing it, and I understand that's your role. But leaking classified documents is a serious issue. It's a recurring problem, not just for this administration, but for any administration trying to implement policy. We've had a lot of leaks, from various sources. I won't speculate on the origin; it's often impossible to identify the leaker. You have an advantage there.

[SEP] So, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will—there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce—nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded.

New perspectives are beneficial. Examining past actions and determining what works and what doesn't is crucial for any new president. That's what I did, and I expect my successor to do the same. The U.S.-China relationship is incredibly important, impacting the global economy, national security, and the Asia-Pacific region. A breakdown in that relationship would be detrimental to everyone. So, it's fine to re-evaluate. I advised the President-elect to approach foreign policy systematically and intentionally. Given that there's only one president at a time, I suggested assembling a full team, briefing them thoroughly on past events, potential pitfalls, and opportunities, and ensuring government-wide alignment before engaging extensively with foreign governments. Regarding Taiwan, there's a longstanding understanding between China, the U.S., and Taiwan to maintain the status quo. Taiwan operates differently, and China recognizes this. The Taiwanese have agreed to refrain from declaring independence as long as they maintain some autonomy. While not entirely satisfactory to all parties, this has maintained peace and allowed Taiwan to thrive. However, for China, Taiwan is a core issue.

But what's transpired since then isn't about my personal success; it's about the success of the American people. It demonstrates that Democrats and Republicans can have fundamental disagreements, even engage in protracted debates, but ultimately find common ground to advance the nation's interests. We accomplished that with the tax compromise. I continue to believe that providing tax cuts to those who don't require them when we're grappling with deficits is misguided.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There's a perception that you're letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election and that a response that nobody knows about or a look-back review just don't cut it. Are you prepared to call out President Putin by name for ordering this hacking? And do you agree with what Hillary Clinton now says, that the hacking was actually partially responsible for her loss? And is your administration's open quarreling with Trump and his team on this issue tarnishing the smooth transition of power that you have promised? [SEP] Well, first of all, with respect to the transition, I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful as I promised. And that will continue. And it's just been a few days since I last talked to the President-elect about a whole range of transition issues. That cooperation is going to continue.There hasn't been a lot of squabbling. What we've simply said is the facts, which are that, based on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and that, as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference through cyber attacks in the future.That should be a bipartisan issue; that shouldn't be a partisan issue. And my hope is that the President-elect is going to similarly be concerned with making sure that we don't have potential foreign influence in our election process. I don't think any American wants that. And that shouldn't be a source of an argument.I think that part of the challenge is that it gets caught up in the carryover from election season. And I think it is very important for us to distinguish between the politics of the election and the need for us, as a country, both from a national security perspective, but also in terms of the integrity of our election system and our democracy, to make sure that we don't create a political football here.Now, with respect to how this thing unfolded last year, let's just go through the facts pretty quickly. At the beginning of the summer, we're alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it, investigate it thoroughly, to brief the potential victims of this hacking, to brief on a bipartisan basis the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the relevant intelligence committees. And once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact, had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russia had hacked into the DNC.And at that time, we did not attribute motives or any interpretations of why they had done so. We didn't discuss what the effects of it might be. We simply let people know—the public know, just as we had let Members of Congress know—that this had happened. And as a consequence, all of you wrote a lot of stories about both what had happened, and then you interpreted why that might have happened and what effect it was going to have on the election outcomes. We did not. And the reason we did not was because in this hyperpartisan atmosphere, at a time when my primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens, I wanted to make sure that everybody understood we were playing this thing straight, that we weren't trying to advantage one side or another, but what we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place, and so if you started seeing effects on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account.And that's exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place; at a time, by the way, when the President-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.And finally, I think it's worth pointing out that the information was already out. It was in the hands of WikiLeaks, so that was going to come out no matter what. What I was concerned about, in particular, was making sure that that wasn't compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself.And so in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn't. And in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred.So when I look back in terms of how we handled it, I think we handled it the way it should have been handled. We allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence. We briefed all relevant parties involved in terms of what was taking place. When we had a consensus around what had happened, we announced it, not through the White House, not through me, but rather through the intelligence communities that had actually carried out these investigations. And then, we allowed you and the American public to make an assessment as to how to weigh that going into the election.And the truth is, is that there was nobody here who didn't have some sense of what kind of effect it might have. I'm finding it a little curious that everybody is suddenly acting surprised that this looked like it was disadvantaging Hillary Clinton, because you guys wrote about it every day. [] Every single leak. About every little juicy tidbit of political gossip, including John Podesta's risotto recipe. [] This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage.So I do think it's worth us reflecting how it is that a Presidential election of such importance, of such moment, with so many big issues at stake, and such a contrast between the candidates, came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. What is it about our political system that made us vulnerable to these kinds of potential manipulations, which, as I've said publicly before, were not particularly sophisticated. This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic Party e-mails that contained pretty routine stuff, some of it embarrassing or uncomfortable, because I suspect that if any of us got our e-mails hacked into, there might be some things that we wouldn't want suddenly appearing on the front page of a newspaper or a telecast, even if there wasn't anything particularly illegal or controversial about it. And then, it just took off.And that concerns me. And it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is, is that everybody had the information. It was out there. And we handled it the way we should have.Now, moving forward, I think there are a couple of issues that this raises. Number one is just the constant challenge that we are going to have with cybersecurity throughout our economy and throughout our society. We are a digitalized culture, and there is hacking going on every single day. There's not a company, there's not a major organization, there's not a financial institution, there's not a branch of our Government where somebody is not going to be phishing for something or trying to penetrate or put in a virus or malware. And this is why for the last 8 years, I've been obsessed with how do we continually upgrade our cybersecurity systems.And this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cyber issues being used in ways that can affect our infrastructure, affect the stability of our financial systems, and affect the integrity of our institutions, like our election process.I just received a couple weeks back—it wasn't widely reported on—a report from our cybersecurity Commission that outlines a whole range of strategies to do a better job on this. But it's difficult, because it's not all housed—the target of cyber attacks is not one entity, but it's widely dispersed, and a lot of it is private, like the DNC. It's not a branch of government. We can't tell people what to do. What we can do is inform them, get best practices.What we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other countries against these kinds of attacks. And we've done that in the past. So just as I told Russia to stop it and indicated there will be consequences when they do it, the Chinese have, in the past, engaged in cyber attacks directed at our companies to steal trade secrets and proprietary technology. And I had to have the same conversation with Prime Minister—or with President Xi, and what we've seen is some evidence that they have reduced, but not completely eliminated, these activities, partly because they can use cutouts.One of the problems with the Internet and cyber issues is that there's not always a return address, and by the time you catch up to it, attributing what happened to a particular Government can be difficult, not always provable in court even though our intelligence communities can make an assessment.What we've also tried to do is to start creating some international norms about this to prevent some sort of cyber arms race, because we obviously have offensive capabilities as well as defensive capabilities. And my approach is not a situation in which everybody is worse off because folks are constantly attacking each other back and forth, but putting some guardrails around the behavior of nation-states, including our adversaries, just so that they understand that whatever they do to us we can potentially do to them.We do have some special challenges, because oftentimes, our economy is more digitalized, it is more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than some of these other countries. And we have a more open society and engage in less control and censorship over what happens over the Internet, which is also part of what makes us special.Last point—and the reason I'm going on here is because I know that you guys have a lot of questions about this, and I haven't addressed all of you directly about it—with respect to response, my principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnished, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that somehow tampering had taken place with the actual process of voting. And we accomplished that.That does not mean that we are not going to respond. It simply meant that we had a set of priorities leading up to the election that were of the utmost importance. Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you.But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. And I know that there have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians. But keep in mind that we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians. The relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years. And so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us, is something that's worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that's exactly what we've done.So at a point in time where we've taken certain actions that we can divulge publicly, we will do so. There are times where the message will go—will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized. And I should point out, by the way, part of why the Russians have been effective on this is because they don't go around announcing what they're doing. It's not like Putin is going around the world publicly saying, look what we did, wasn't that clever? He denies it. So the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective, I think, doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.Okay?", "label": "Dodging"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Rick Ledgett's comments on Edward Snowden, were you aware that he was going to suggest amnesty?

There was a way to have this conversation without causing so much damage. The United States is a country that abides by the rule of law and cares deeply about privacy and civil liberties. Because of these disclosures, countries that engage in surveillance of their own citizens are able to criticize us unfairly.

What are some of the follow-up effects, if you do have any follow-up actions? And do you have any thoughts of proposing a meeting with Chairman Kim at an earlier date? [SEP] The process is not something that we discussed between ourselves during the summit meeting. In fact, when I was staying in Washington, DC, I had an interview with one of the newspapers there, and it came up. Of course, it was not a sudden suggestion. I did have a meeting among my staff and related ministries, and I talked about this in detail before I came to the United States.We have a new administration in Korea, and we haven't yet to begun dialogue with the ns. Inter-Korean dialogue, there is a need for us to have dialogue all the time. Up until now, we had dialogues whenever the need arose, and then it would stop. However, dialogue should be based on genuine cooperation and sincerity. And so with this in mind, I thought that it would be helpful to set up a permanent liaison office in both Seoul and Pyongyang.As for the summit meeting between myself and Chairman Kim, I will agree to it when the need is real. And I already said publicly that I am willing to meet with him—not just once, but many times—but if the meeting will yield substantial and real results. I believe only when that is possible, I am ready to meet with him and have sincere dialogue, because that will help to bring about peace and stability of the peninsula.So basically, I do hold that thought, but I'm not suggesting that—to have a meeting with Chairman Kim anytime soon.

Our system allows for a Congress and President from different parties with differing views. The key is how we handle it. The right way is to fight for our positions on disagreements, then work together where we agree. That's how it was with Reagan and the Democratic Congress. They didn't let disagreements stop them from working together. I expect the same here. Some Republicans disagree with me on immigration reform, and that's their right.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of the Republican nominee's recent statements regarding the Khan family and his openness to recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, do you question his suitability for the presidency?

Is your recent decision to bomb ISIS in Libya a direct consequence of that oversight? [SEP] Look, I've already stated my concerns about the Republican nominee's fitness for office, and frankly, he continues to validate those concerns. Attacking a Gold Star family who have sacrificed so much for our country is beyond the pale. His apparent lack of understanding of critical issues in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia demonstrates a profound lack of preparedness for this job. And it's not just my opinion; leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, and figures like John McCain, have repeatedly denounced his statements. The question they need to ask themselves is this: If you consistently and strongly condemn his words, why do you continue to endorse him? What does it say about your party that he is your standard-bearer? This isn't a matter of occasional missteps; it's a daily and weekly occurrence where they distance themselves from his pronouncements. There must come a point where they say, 'This is not someone I can support for President,' even if he claims to be a member of my party. Their failure to do so renders their denunciations hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity, but there must be a point where they recognize that someone who makes such statements lacks the judgment, temperament, and understanding required for the most powerful position in the world. Many people rely on the White House to get things right, and this goes beyond mere policy disagreements. I understand that they profoundly disagree with me or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or foreign policy, but I never doubted the competence of previous Republican Presidents. I disagreed with Mitt Romney and John McCain on certain issues, but I never questioned their ability to do the job. Had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have assured Americans that they would uphold norms, rules, common sense, decency, and possess sufficient knowledge of economic policy, foreign policy, and our constitutional traditions to govern effectively. This situation is different, and it's not just my opinion. Many prominent Republicans share this view. There must come a point where they say, 'Enough.' Otherwise, the entire Republican Party effectively endorses and validates Mr. Trump's positions, which I believe do not represent the views of many Republicans. Regarding Libya, I've consistently stated that we did the right thing in preventing a potential massacre under a U.N. mandate. However, we collectively failed to adequately plan for the aftermath to ensure security and peace. The good news is that we now have the beginnings of a Government of National Accord committed to uniting factions and establishing security. At their request, and after significant progress against ISIS, we are working in partnership to prevent ISIS from gaining a foothold in Libya.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, one of the reasons Anthem said--Anthem BlueCross says that it's raising its premiums is because so many people are dropping out of individual coverage because the economy is so bad, and that leaves the people in the pool who are people who need medical care driving up costs. One of the reasons why businesses are not expanding right now, in addition to some of the credit issues you've talked about, at least according to business leaders, is they say there's an uncertainty of what they need to plan for because of the energy bill, because of health care. That's what they say. I'm not saying it's true or not, but that's what they say. What do you say when you hear that? [SEP] Well, I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression, and people weren't sure whether the financial system was going to melt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession. So let's be clear about the sources of uncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years: a huge contraction, trillions of dollars of losses in people's 401(k)s, people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that they still haven't worked out, the housing market losing a whole bunch of value.So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent, the economy is now growing by 6 percent. The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments, and I anticipate that they're going to start hiring at a more rapid clip. What I've also heard is them saying that we would like to feel like Washington is working and able to get some things done.There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty. One way would be to say, well, you know what, we'll just go back to what we were doing before on, let's say, the financial markets. We won't have the regulations that we need; we won't make any changes in terms of too big to fail. That will provide certainty, until the next financial crisis.That's not the kind of certainty, I think, that the financial markets need. The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets, so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail, that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts. That requires legislation. The sooner we can get that done, the better.The same would be true when it comes to health care. A lot of CEOs I hear from will say, Boy, we'd like you to get health care settled one way or another, but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums, and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent, that's the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment.So I guess my answer would be this: The sooner the business community has a sense that we've got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be. I absolutely agree on that.What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform, for example, to say, boy, we'd be doing fine if we just didn't try to regulate the banks.

[SEP] Look, we're working hand-in-glove with the Iraqi government to establish a framework that addresses a multitude of concerns. The transition to 'overwatch,' as you call it, is contingent on a number of factors, including the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces and the overall security environment. We're aiming for a situation where U.S. forces are primarily focused on training, logistics, and special operations. Now, as for the safety of our troops, that's always paramount. We're negotiating the necessary authorities and protections to ensure their well-being. These discussions are ongoing, and we expect to have a finalized agreement soon.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the looming fiscal cliff, is there any conceivable scenario where we fail to reach a resolution by year's end? And regarding Iran, are you planning a final diplomatic effort to address their nuclear program, potentially involving direct talks? [SEP] Well, let's be frank, a fiscal cliff outcome is imaginable. If Congressional gridlock persists, even after the election's clear message, and we can't even agree on tax cuts for the middle class, then those families will face a significant tax increase. That's going to sting, impacting holiday spending and, consequently, business investment and hiring, potentially triggering another recession. It's avoidable and unnecessary. My priority is immediate certainty for middle-class families, ensuring 98% of those earning under $250,000 and 97% of small businesses don't see a tax hike. That's doable. Then, we can tackle tax reform, close loopholes, simplify the system, and address entitlements. I'm prepared to make substantial commitments to deficit reduction. I've been immersed in this for years; the math is straightforward. Tough choices are necessary, but we can protect middle-class families, seniors, and those with disabilities while investing in growth areas like research and education. As some Republicans have acknowledged, a modest tax increase on the wealthy won't cripple them. It won't deter business investment. So, we know the path forward. It hinges on bipartisan cooperation, putting the American people first. I hope that prevails. On Iran, I remain committed to a diplomatic solution. My stance hasn't wavered: we won't allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. But a diplomatic window remains open. We've implemented the most stringent sanctions ever, impacting Iran's economy. They should be able to access peaceful nuclear power while adhering to international obligations and assuring the world they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon. I will intensify efforts in the coming months to foster dialogue between Iran and the international community. Whether Iran seizes this opportunity remains to be seen, but it's the preferred course.", "label": "General"}

China is having a massive flareup right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.And I notice that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any of the news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it.

No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people with great—in many cases, about 50 percent now rapid fire, meaning 5- to 15- to 20-minute test, where you get the result almost immediately.

Now what has happened, as you know, people have taken those mortgages and bundled them up as securities. And somebody else owns the mortgage; it's not the originating bank; it's somebody else owns the mortgage.And so Secretary Paulson is working with a more complex industry than we've had in the past. And that's why it's taken a while, Ed, because not only do you have the lender, you now have a whole service industry that has arisen that will, hopefully, help people stay in their homes—that's their job—but you've also got people all around the world who now own U.S. mortgages, invest—and assets that are U.S. mortgage—bundles of U.S. mortgages.And so it's a complex assignment.

And how do you feel about this notion that Iraq can once again become the buffer between Iranian influence and Russian influence in the Middle East? Do you feel that under this Prime Minister that that's possible once again? What are your thoughts on it? [SEP] Well, this is a man that I get along with very well. We're largely out of Iraq. We're down to a very few soldiers. I said we're getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous, endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there. In the Middle East, we should have never been. But we're getting out rapidly, out of—you know, over the course of 3 years. And getting out—it's very sticky getting out. And some people agree, and many people don't agree, but I think most people very much agree.We're doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan. We're getting out. We're down to a much smaller number of people left there. And you know, I greet men and women coming home, and coming home after they've been hit. I've also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in.And we've been there 19 years, and we're basically policemen. We're acting as police, as opposed to soldiers. And they're going to have to police their own states, and they've been doing that for thousands of years. But it's time, after 19 years, that our soldiers come home.They've done an incredible job, but you know, they don't—they're not allowed to fight to win. And maybe they shouldn't be, because a lot of the people—it's not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq—again, we're down in Afghanistan; very low numbers. And that'll be taking place.And I let them know, Do anything, and you'll be hit like you've never hit—be hit—been hit before. So we're doing very well. Syria, the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey. Right? And everybody said, Oh, this is—that was 2 years ago. It was a long time ago. They said: Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible. We're going to leave.Why do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan. And Syria has been fighting forever. And I say, Why are we guarding their border? And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out. And guess what? Nothing's happened. They've been fighting like they have been for a thousand years. Okay? Nothing's happened. And nobody mentions that.Everybody said, This is going to be a disaster. There's no disaster; nothing's happened. And so we're getting out of the endless wars. And we are building a military, the likes of which the world has never seen: $2½ trillion we have spent. And we, hopefully, don't ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture.It's—when you look at what China is doing, when you look at what Russia is doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing, we want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe.

And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world.If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they're seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today, it does.So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any administration has to deal with today, and respond to much more rapidly than ever before, that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about 2 weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it's fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they've got to figure out in about an hour what their response is.So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staffparticularly your Chief of Staff, your National Security Adviser, your White House Counselhow you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that, ultimately, the President is going to be the final decisionmaker, that that's something that has to be attended to right away.I have been blessed by havingand I admittedly am biasedsome of the smartest, hardest working, good people in my administration that I think any President has ever had.

It takes time to put that together.But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter.

First of all, there are 500,000 children who are eligible for the current program who aren't covered. And so, to answer your question on how far I'm willing to go, I want to provide enough money to make sure those 500,000 do get covered. That's the—that ought to be the focus of our efforts.Six or seven—in six or seven States, they spend more money on adults than children. And finally, the eligibility has been increased up to $83,000.

And it took a long time to get there. I mean, we're working hard to send a concerted message to the ians, a focused, unified message that the world believes you should not have a nuclear program. And so this is a multilateral approach to try to get the Government to alter its course on a nuclear weapons program.I can't think of any more robust diplomacy than to have more than one party at the table talking to the ians. And we did so through the United Nations at this case. If they want us at the table, we're more than willing to come, but there must be a verifiable suspension of this weapons program that is causing such grave concern.We'll continue to work with other nations.

Furthermore, won't these soaring gasoline prices undermine the benefits of the economic stimulus package? [SEP] Look, there's no doubt that rising gasoline prices are hurting working families. We've had an energy policy that neglected domestic energy production for too long, and now we're paying the price. We should have been exploring for oil and gas in ANWR, but Congress kept blocking us from opening up new areas for environmentally responsible exploration. This has made us more dependent on foreign oil. Fortunately, Canada and Mexico are major suppliers, and we appreciate that. But our energy policy hasn't been effective, and we're seeing the results. There's also not a lot of extra oil capacity in the world. Unfortunately, a lot of the supplies come from politically unstable regions. Again, Canada and Mexico are exceptions. Some countries aren't reinvesting in their reserves, which causes them to decline. I'm worried about our consumers. That's why we passed the tax relief. Congress should make it permanent. Some want to tax the rich, but that won't raise enough money to cover their spending. Those schemes always end up taxing the middle class. In times of economic uncertainty, we need tax certainty.

[SEP] First, on 'Fast and Furious,' my Attorney General has made it absolutely clear that he would never have authorized such a thing. The investigation is ongoing, and I won't comment while it's active. I've said my piece: that would be completely inappropriate, and we need to find out how it happened. Once the investigation concludes, we'll take appropriate action. As for E-Verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. We need a balanced approach that upholds our laws and our tradition as a nation of immigrants. That means strong borders, going after employers who break the law, and a pathway to legal status for those living in the shadows. We may not get everything we want, but we need a balanced package. E-Verify can be a useful tool if it's accurate and protects U.S. citizens. We can't have a system that unfairly rejects qualified candidates.

What do you expect to come out of that meeting? And do you think it would be helpful if your friend there, standing there, Mr. Bush, were to see you in Jeddah at that meeting? [SEP] Our strategy is to deny safe haven to extremists who would do harm to innocent people. And that's the strategy of Afghanistan. It needs to be the strategy of Pakistan. It's in all our interests to prevent those who murder innocent people to achieve political objectives to gain safe haven.And so we'd look forward to working— I mean, one thing that can happen is, there can be, you know, more dialogue between the Pak Government and the Afghan Government. Now, there was—in the past, they had a jirga amongst tribal leaders in the region on both—from both sides of the border that made a difference. And I think that would be a good idea to restart the jirga process.I know there needs to be dialogue between the intel services between the respective countries. And I know there needs to be better cooperation, and there needs to be trilateral cooperation on the border— trilateral being Pak, Afghan, and coalition border patrols—to prevent people from coming back and forth across the border.And there's a lot of common ground.

And if I'm the President of a country and people are coming from one country to another—allegedly coming from one country to another—to kill innocent civilians on my side, I'd be concerned about it. But we can help. We can help calm the situation down and develop a strategy that will prevent these extremists from, you know, from developing safe haven and having freedom of movement. Can I say, I'm traveling to Jeddah next Sunday at the invitation of the King of Saudi Arabia. And I want a long-term dialogue, and this is part of a process, not an event, between oil producers and oil consumers. I think there is a view developing that the price of oil is increasingly dependent not just on today's demand and supply factors but on what people perceive as demand outstripping supply next year, in the medium term, and in the long term.And I want to tell the King of Saudi Arabia and others who are there that the world will build more nuclear power. And I have suggested that on present trends, it would be about 1,000 nuclear power stations over the next 30 years. The world will increase its use of renewables. The world will increase its use of coal. It will lessen its dependence on oil, and that the world is determined to make a more efficient use of oil.And I think this dialogue between producers and consumers is absolutely essential. President Bush has just been in Saudi Arabia. I have not been there recently. I want to go and talk to the King and talk to others there about what I believe should be a process whereby we understand what are the pressures on demand in future years, as well as we understand the pressures on supply. And I believe that that long-term debate about the future can have an effect on today's markets.Now, that's what the debate is about. And that is part of a process that I hope will continue, if necessary, with a meeting in London later and with further meetings, so that there is a genuine dialogue between producers and consumers about what is the most worrying situation in the world at the moment, and that is the trebling of the price of oil.", "label": "Explicit"}

And should the U.S. engagement--renewed engagement be seen in any way as a counterbalance to a rising China? [SEP] I have not--I've been out of town, so I'm just seeing the press reports. I have not had a full briefing on Israel's intentions and what they've communicated to our administration. But this kind of activity is never helpful when it comes to peace negotiations. And I'm concerned that we're not seeing each side make the extra effort involved to get a breakthrough that could finally create a framework for a secure Israel living side and side--side by side in peace with a sovereign Palestine.We're going to keep on working on it, though, because it is in the world's interest, it is in the interest of the people of Israel, and it is in the interest of the Palestinian people to achieve that settlement, to achieve that agreement. But each of these incremental steps can end up breaking down trust between the parties.Even though it wasn't directed to me, I do want to just chime in briefly on the issue of China. We want China to succeed and prosper. It's good for the United States if China continues on the path of development that it's on.That means that, first of all, just from a humanitarian point of view, lifting millions of people out of poverty is a good thing.

And we're not interested in containing that process. We want China to continue to achieve its development goals.We do want to make sure that everybody is operating within an international framework and sets of rules in which countries recognize their responsibilities to each other. That's true for the United States. That's true for China. That's true for Indonesia. It's true for all of us. And the more that we have international mechanisms in which people say we have rights, we also have responsibilities, we're going to abide by them, we're going to hold each other accountable, the better off we'll all be.

This region should continue to be a region that is stable, a region that is peaceful and a region that is safe.In this regard, the community that is built upon in Asia, in East Asia also, and also a framework now through the East Asia summit framework, we have the responsibility to--in one area, to ensure that the cooperation in the region, especially in the area of economic cooperation, can contribute significantly to the development of the global economy that will bring benefit for all humanity.On the other spot of the coin, we also have the responsibility to ensure stability and security in our region. I am not using any theory or the theory of one power to counterbalance the other powers. But I do have the view that there must be some form of dynamic equilibrium in Asia-Pacific, in East and Southeast Asia. And the formation of such regional cooperation such that is East Asia summit, where there are 10 countries from ASEAN and there is also China, Republic of Korea, Japan, India, Australia, New Zealand, and now Russia and the United States, therefore, I have faith that it will be more effective to ensure peace, stability, and order in this region.And in this regard, with such a condition, such cooperation in the area of economic will go effectively, and it is Indonesia's hope that China and the U.S. relations will continue to flow well because if something happens between those two states, it will have severe impacts to not only countries in the region, in Asia, but also to the world.For that reason, I hope that the economic relations between the U.S. and China will continue to proceed well, despite the geopolitical developments.

However, let me emphasize one crucial point: the establishment of such bases should not be interpreted as an escalation that would provoke increased Russian aggression and militarization in the region. It's imperative to recognize that Russia has been systematically militarizing areas like Kaliningrad Oblast for over a decade. This aggressive posture, exemplified by events in Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea, underscores the need for a strong deterrent. The U.S. presence serves as a guarantee of security and defense for our part of Europe, the free world. We seek the presence of both U.S. and NATO forces to safeguard our interests. While Mr. President and his advisors must consider all factors, the arguments in favor of a U.S. military presence are compelling, particularly in light of the violation of international law and aggressive behaviors we are witnessing. Deterrence is the most effective way to prevent war. President Trump also mentioned Poland's willingness to contribute financially to such a base, aligning with his broader focus on burden-sharing among allies.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the intelligence reports indicating a civil war in Iraq, your insistence on achieving victory, and the potential threat to our national security, how can you reconcile your commitment to a 'non-open-ended' involvement? [SEP] The notion of 'victory' in Iraq must be understood in a contemporary context, distinct from the total victory of World War II. The challenge lies in articulating a realistic vision of success to the American public. We envision a society characterized by *relative* peace. The complete absence of car bombings is an unrealistic expectation. The fundamental objective is to empower the Iraqi government with the necessary security apparatus to suppress the ethnic cleansing witnessed in certain regions. Furthermore, Iraq faces challenges related to general criminality. Al-Qaeda maintains a presence, responsible for several high-profile attacks. Zarqawi, a foreign terrorist, explicitly sought to incite sectarian conflict through violence, and his efforts were partially successful. Finally, there exists a faction of disaffected Sunnis who believe they should retain power despite their minority status. They are prepared to employ violence to destabilize the country and regain control. Therefore, irrespective of the label applied, the situation is complex and requires internal resolution. While some observers characterize it as a civil war, others disagree. Nevertheless, the situation is sufficiently precarious to warrant intervention. We seek a government founded on constitutional principles, a nation where citizens feel secure, where resources are distributed equitably, where provinces enjoy a degree of autonomy, where non-criminal political actors can participate, and where Iraq serves as an ally in the war on terror – a bastion of moderation rather than a haven for extremism. This constitutes our definition of success.", "label": "Deflection"}

[SEP] The world expects Iran and Syria to assist Iraq, and we've made that clear. Regarding Iran, we have several issues. First, will they help Iraq's young democracy succeed? Second, will they help Lebanon's democracy, specifically the Siniora Government, which is a priority for this administration? The biggest issue is Iran's potential acquisition of nuclear weapons. Our issues with Iran are numerous. Our position is clear: isolation is not the path forward for the Iranian government and people. We will continue to emphasize that their support for terrorism will lead to further isolation. We are actively engaged in diplomatic efforts. The Iranians know our position on Iraq, and more importantly, they know the Iraqis' position. We are supporting a sovereign government. The Iraqis have conveyed to the Iranians: help us succeed by not interfering in our internal affairs. As for Syria, our message remains consistent: do not undermine the Siniora Government in Lebanon; assist Israel in recovering the prisoner captured by Hamas; prevent Hamas and Hizballah from plotting attacks against democracies in the Middle East; and provide assistance within Iraq.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given Rick Ledgett's recent comments, is the administration open to considering amnesty or a plea deal for Edward Snowden, and what's your message to those who believe Snowden acted justly? [SEP] I must be cautious, as Mr. Snowden faces criminal charges, and the matter is before the Attorney General and the courts. Therefore, I cannot comment directly on the specifics. However, I've previously stated that the debate sparked by his actions was important. However, the manner of the disclosures harmed the U.S. and our intelligence operations. There was a better way to have this discussion. The U.S. upholds the rule of law and values privacy and civil liberties. These disclosures have allowed countries that engage in the very actions Snowden criticized to deflect criticism onto the U.S. While the debate was necessary, it's crucial to acknowledge the damage to U.S. intelligence and diplomacy.

But our military was in very bad shape. We've rebuilt the military. We've got one of the strongest economies.Mike Pence actually got some—who is right here. Our great Vice President. He was talking yesterday and he called me. He says Boy these numbers—these consumer numbers are incredible. The retail numbers that came out 2 days ago that really weren't reported were really—I mean just incredible numbers. You know that very well. That's your world. And some other numbers.We're doing very well. Our economy is very strong. And China is being affected very badly. We're not; we're not being affected. In fact we're taking in many billions of dollars. And China is eating that. You know China is eating the tariffs because of the devaluation. Now that doesn't happen with all countries. China is China and they know what they're doing as well as anybody.My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one very good one. But we have right now a little spat. But I think we're doing very well.Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happens 3 days ago where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil and the prices go up $4 $5 and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you—that would have happened years ago it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip.So it's been really amazing what we've been able to do. I think the voters understand that. I don't think it has any impact on the election.Now if something happened I think that would probably be a positive for the election but that's okay. I do think signing USMCA on a bipartisan basis with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody else—very bipartisan—I think that's very important for our country. And I would certainly be willing to say that's a bipartisan deal.But I think that's very important for our manufacturers for our farmers. Even for unions they want that deal done. And so hopefully that's going to be put up to a vote very soon. There will be very little cajoling of the Democrats because most Democrats want it too.But the USMCA is ready to be voted on. It's finished. Mexico has taken their final votes. Canada is willing to do that any time we want them too. They're all set to go. And we need that for all of the—we need that for our country.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Here at this meeting and earlier at the G-7, you've said several times that America is back at allies' side, but a lot of those allies are themselves pretty rattled by what happened on January 6—an attempted overturning of your election—and they may still be alarmed by the continued hold that Donald Trump has over the Republican Party and the rise of nationalist figures like him around the world.What do you say to those allies, what have you been saying to them at these meetings about how the next President of the United States can keep any promises you make? [SEP] What I'm saying is them—to them is: Watch me. I mean, I'm not saying anything, quite frankly. I'm just going out—people, as I've said before, don't doubt that I mean what I say, and they believe that I keep my commitments when I say it.I'm not making any promises to anyone that I don't believe are overwhelmingly likely to be kept. I think that we're at a moment where—I mean, let me put it this way: You may have had a different view, but I think an awful lot of people thought that my showing up at the G-7 would not produce any kind of enthusiasm about American leadership and about where America was. I would suggest that it didn't turn out that way.I would suggest that there is a—the leaders I'm dealing with in NATO and the G-7 are leaders who know our recent history; know, generically, the character of the American people; and know where the vast center of the public stands—not Democrat, Republican—but who we are. We're a decent, honorable nation.And I think that they have seen things happen, as we have, that shocked them and surprised them that could have happened. But I think they, like I do, believe the American people are not going to sustain that kind of behavior.And so I—you know, I don't want to get into the statistics, because you know that old phrase of Disraeli's: There's three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. But I think it's appropriate to say that the Republican Party is vastly diminished in numbers; the leadership of the Republican Party is fractured; and the Trump wing of the party is the bulk of the party, but it makes up a significant minority of the American people.Now, we'll see. We'll see. I believe that by us standing up and saying what we believe to be the case, not engaging in the overwhelming hyperbole that gets engaged in by so many today, that we—I guess that old expression, The proof of the pudding is in the eating.When we said—when I said I was going to deal with beating the virus and I was going to focus on that and I was going to get millions of shots in people's arms, it wasn't me—I just knew the American people. I knew the kind of help I'd get from the Defense Department, from police departments, from the hospitals, from retired docs, from—I just knew. And look how rapidly we moved.Now, we have a group of people who were—everything from the political rejection of the notion of taking a vaccine, to people who were simply afraid of a needle and everything in between. And we have a way to go.But I never doubted that we would be able to generate the kind of support we got and get so many millions of people step up and get vaccinated. So I think it is a shock and surprise that what's happened, in terms of the consequence of President Trump's phony populism, has happened. And it is disappointing that so many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate, who I know know better, have been reluctant to take on, for example, an investigation because they're worried about being primaried.But, at the end of the day, we've been through periods like this in American history before where there has been this reluctance to take a chance on your reelection because of the nature of your party's politics at the moment.I think this is passing. I don't mean easily passing. That's why it's so important that I succeed in my agenda—the agenda, whether it's dealing with the vaccine, the economy, infrastructure. It's important that we demonstrate we can make progress and continue to make progress. And I think we're going to be able to do that.So, as I said, the proof will be in where it is, you know, 6 months from now, where we are. But I think you're going to see that there's—that, God willing, we're going to be making progress, and there's going to be a coalescing of a lot of Republicans, particularly younger Republicans who are coming up in the party.

It's in progress. We'll announce it soon. It's been in the works for a while. We'll have plenty of time to get nominees cleared. I've given it a lot of thought and met with my economic advisors.

[SEP] We're currently conducting an investigation. I don't know the individual, but I'm aware of the issues. The WHO has been unfair to the United States, much like the World Trade Organization, which is now starting to get in line. Why did previous presidents allow China to be classified as a developing nation, allowing them to exploit the United States? I've been addressing this since day one, and we're looking into it very seriously. I have concerns with both the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization.

[SEP] While I doubt we'll ever win over the most extreme elements, the 'super-mega-MAGA Republicans,' I believe they represent a minority within the Republican Party. The vast majority of Republicans are decent, honorable individuals with whom we may have strong disagreements on policy, but who are fundamentally honest and straightforward. I've worked with many of them for years in the Senate and the House. The world is closely observing the United States. At my first G-7 meeting, I declared, 'America is back.' One leader responded by asking, 'For how long?' Another posed a hypothetical: What would I think if thousands stormed the British Parliament to prevent the confirmation of an election? While the situations are not identical, such an event would undoubtedly signal a crisis of democracy in Great Britain. The world is questioning whether the United States remains stable, whether we adhere to our democratic principles and institutions. They are concerned about our commitment to accepting the decisions of the courts, Congress, and the government.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn't passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?

And it's one thing—look, maybe I'm just being too much of an optimist. Remember how we thought not that many people were going to show up to vote in the middle of a pandemic? We had the highest voter turnout in the history of the United States of America.Well, I think if in fact—no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you're going to see them willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. I think you're going to see the people who they're trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.And—but it's going to be difficult.

And now that you've clarified the Bull Connor comments, do you plan to reach out to Republicans like Mitt Romney to talk about reforming the Electoral Count Act? [SEP] Yes, I'm happy to speak out. I've—I've met with—I've talked to Mitt on other occasions. And by the way, I reached out to the minority leader as well at the time that he made his speech. And so I have no reluctance to reach out to any Republican and anyone who—and I've made it clear. Look, I've now had the opportunity to travel because of funerals and eulogies I've made and attended—and Congressmen and Senators who have come along with me. I don't—don't hold me to the number, but somewhere between 20 and 25 Senators and Congresspersons have traveled with me. And I find—you should get the list of them and ask what—how we, you know, sat for the 2, 3, 4, 5 hours that we've flown together—sit back in the—in that conference table and talk to them, ask them questions; they ask me questions. I learned a heck of a lot. But as President, you don't quite have that ability to do that as often as I'd like to be able to do it. And one of the things that I do think that has been made clear to me—speaking of polling—is the public doesn't want me to be the President Senator. They want me to be the President and let Senators be Senators. And so, if I've made—and I've made many mistakes, I'm sure. If I made a mistake, I'm used to negotiating to get things done, and I've been, in the past, relatively successful at it in the United States Senate, even as Vice President.

And did the demonstrators in any way on the streets undermine your efforts, Mayor Emanuel's efforts, to project the image of Chicago you would have liked to have seen? [SEP] I have to tell you, I think Chicago performed magnificently. Those of us who were in the summit had a great experience. If you talk to leaders from around the world, they love the city. Michelle took some of the spouses down to the South Side to see the Comer Center, where wonderful stuff is being done with early education. They saw the Art Institute.I was just talking to David Cameron. I think he's sneaking off and doing a little sightseeing before he heads home. I encouraged everybody to shop. I want to boost the hometown economy. We gave each leader a Bean--a small model--for them to remember, as well as a football from Soldier Field. Many of them did not know what to do with it. [] So people had a wonderful time, and I think the Chicagoans that they interacted with couldn't have been more gracious and more hospitable. So I could not have been prouder.Now, I think with respect to the protesters, as I said, this is part of what NATO defends, is free speech and the freedom of assembly. And frankly, to my Chicago press, outside of Chicago, folks really weren't all that stressed about the possibility of having some protesters here, because that's what--part of what America is about. And obviously, Rahm was stressed, but he performed wonderfully, and the Chicago police, Chicago's finest, did a great job under some significant pressure and a lot of scrutiny.The only other thing I'll say about this is thank you to everybody who endured the traffic situation. Obviously, Chicago residents who had difficulties getting home or getting to work or what have you, that's--what can I tell you, that's part of the price of being a world city. But this was a great showcase. And if it makes those folks feel any better, despite being 15 minutes away from my house, nobody would let me go home. I was thinking I would be able to sleep in my own bed tonight. They said I would cause even worse traffic. So I ended up staying in a hotel, which contributes to the Chicago economy.

That's the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?

Prime Minister, President Biden, thank you very much.First, to Prime Minister: With the Russian aggression of Ukraine, Prime Minister, you've been saying that security of Europe and security of the Indo-Pacific are inseparable. In today's meeting, did you talk about response to China? How did you analyze the current status of the cross-Straits relations? Did the Japanese side or U.S. side explain how U.S. would respond in times of contingency? What was the request from the U.S. side regarding Japanese response to a contingency in cross-Straits situation? Did you explain the defense budget increase or enemy base strike capability? What did you explain in that context, Prime Minister?Prime Minister Kishida. Well, thank you for your question. First of all, at today's summit meeting, as regards Taiwan Strait issue that you asked, we confirmed that basic stances of two countries on Taiwan remains to be unchanged and underscored the importance of peace and stability of Taiwan Strait, which is an indispensable element for security and prosperity of international community, and called upon peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.Well, in the region, security-related environment is getting severer. Unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, like Russia's aggression against Ukraine this time, should never be tolerated in Indo-Pacific. Above all, in East Asia, it's indispensable to further strengthen Japan-U.S. alliance.Based on this shared awareness, I have said that—fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capability. And I stated my determination to fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capabilities and secure substantial increase of its defense budget needed to effect it. And President Biden strongly supported my determination.And also from myself, I have said that includes what is called enemy base strike capability. All the options will be there, not to exclude any one of them. And this is what I said to President in Indo-Pacific region, as well as to ensure the peace and prosperity of the international community, the basis is the cornerstone of which is Japan-U.S. alliance.

But, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the economy. During your trip here to Asia, you've promoted the investments by Samsung and Hyundai.

Let's be clear: We've done more testing than anyone else, period. More than India with its 1.5 billion people, more than China, more than everyone. Our testing is the best in the world. Other countries are calling us, begging to know how we do it. But here's the deal: when you test as much as we do – 65 million people and counting – you're going to find more cases, obviously.

We even became the 'ventilator king,' supplying the whole world with these complex and vital machines. And when you look at the numbers, we were impacted less than many other countries.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn't negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did. Last year, you said that you wouldn't extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did. So as you say now that you're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the 1-minute-to-midnight scenario, that you're not going to back down? [SEP] Well, first of all, Julianna, let's take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff. I didn't say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts. What I said was we weren't going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and we didn't. Now, you can argue that during the campaign, I saidI set the criteria for wealthy at 250, and we ended up being at 400. But the fact of the matter is millionaires, billionaires, are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said. So from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a Tax Code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure that middle class taxes did not go up.The difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we've already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at the time, I indicated that there were cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth. I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package. But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending. My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made, and we've made those cuts.Now, the challenge going forward is that we've now made some big cuts, and if we're going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way.The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we've made on things like Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we've made to make sure that seniors don't go into poverty or that children who are disabled are properly cared for. For us to change that contract we've made with the American people rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don't need, that points to a long-term trend in which we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this Government, which is, is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people; that you don't have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy.Another way of putting it is, we've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again. And now wenow is as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there's really no stopping the principle. I mean, literallyeven in divided government, even where we've got a Democratic President and a Democratic Senatethat a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say every 2 months, every 3 months, every 6 months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise, we're going to have America not pay its bills. And that is no way for us to do business.And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican President and a Republican Senate, and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way 100 percent of the time, or otherwise, we are going to default on America's obligations.", "label": "General"}

While it's a dangerous place, is it the right decision to draw down the force level at a time when it's a dangerous place and meanwhile Afghan forces are less equipped and they cannot fight truly?[The reporter and President Ghani spoke in Pashto, and their remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. Mr. President, my question is, the peace process—what was your initial—or your request from the United States President?

And this is obvious for us, and we are thankful for the support. . Afghanistan is still a dangerous place. The way it's going to become less dangerous is by Afghan security forces and Afghan police being capable of keeping law and order and security in the country. And that is not going to happen if foreign forces are continually relied upon for the basic security of Afghanistan.So there are going to be specialized areas where we can cooperate, dealing with some of the most vicious terrorist networks. There's going to be intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism cooperation. And there are going to be specialized areas where we can provide logistical support and training and enabling support.But the fact is, is that unless Afghan soldiers and Afghan police are able to maintain security, at some point, someday, the United States and other coalition forces would leave. And the good news is, what we've seen as we've removed ourselves from combat roles is the Afghan security forces have stepped up. And although they're certainly not as well equipped as coalition forces, they're better equipped than the Taliban. They're better equipped than the Haqqani network.And so with the kind of leadership that President Ghani is showing as a Commander in Chief, with the leadership that's being shown by a growing cadre of military officers up and down the military chain, Afghan forces are proving themselves and discovering that, in fact, when they fight, they can be successful. And we want to stand with them in that process because we are very much invested in your success.So, Mr. President, thank you for an outstanding visit. Thank you, Mr. President.

{"sentence": "Q. And to Chancellor Scholz: Can you outline specific steps that Germany is taking to reduce its energy dependence on Russia? And what do you say to those who suggest that German reliance on Russian gas is limiting Europe's options for how to respond to the crisis in Ukraine?Chancellor Scholz. Thank you very much for raising that question because it gives me the opportunity to address a topic that's important to me. One good news, maybe, within its strategy on fighting manmade climate change, Germany has decided at very short—in a very short period of time to phase out of the use of oil and gas by—very soon. And by 2045, Germany will have a carbon-neutral economy as one of the strongest economies of the world.And with regard to these energies—we often think about heating at home and driving a car, but we're talking about industrial production: producing steel, chemical substances, cement. And changing these industrial processes and reorganizing such systems is what we have planned.So this year, we will continue to take far-reaching decisions that will help us to use more wind energy—offshore wind energy, onshore wind energy—and solar energy; and expand the capacities, expand the grids; and have a strategy for Germany, but also worldwide on the use of hydrogen, which is a central element for us to change our industrial processes that are using oil and gas right now.The industry is willing to be on board. We're doing this together with them, but it will probably be the biggest industrial modernization project in Germany in 100 years, with very good prospects that we will develop new technologies that other partners in the world can use as well, and this will help us fight climate change.And by the way, the energy mix today, we are talking about one-quarter of our energy that is linked to gas. And only part of that gas comes from Russia; a big part comes from Norway or the Netherlands. And of course, it is very important to us that we develop an infrastructure that will give us the opportunity to have all options available and react if needed.So you don't have to be concerned. There are some who should be concerned who see themselves maybe too much as a deliverer of such resources. Because we are focusing on renewable energies, we will go down that path and make sure that this is the profitable future.Mr. Rinke [Andreas Rinke, Reuters].Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)/U.S. Energy Exports/Russia  Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question about LNG. Germany and Europe are much more dependent on Russian gas than other regions of the world, and you promised European allies to help with LNG. But this resource is more expensive; it's not available in the volumes that might be needed to replace Russian gas. And I would like to know from you how you would help Europeans in case of a conflict with Russia. Is this an empty promise, or what can you really do? What can you offer?And, in addition, the U.S. are buying oil from Russia worth billions of dollars. And I would like to know whether these transfers are also part of the sanctions package against Russia.And, Mr. Chancellor—liquefied natural gas. There is a big controversy in Germany about fracking gas. And how far is LNG even a real replacement, or is it also with a view to the climate club you intend to found? Is it really an alternative to Russian pipeline gas? [SEP] Let me respond. First of all, we are looking at opportunities to make up for lost gas—LNG—from Russia. We're underway of trying to see what we can do to do that and dealing with our friends around the world, as well. We think we could make up a significant portion of it that would be lost.But you know, what everybody forgets here is, Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil. Russia relies—a significant part of Russia's budget—it's the only thing they really have to export. And if in fact it's cut off, then they're going to be hurt very badly as well. And it's of consequence to them as well. This is not just a one-way street.And so we are looking at what we could do to help compensate for loss of—immediate loss of gas in Europe if it occurs. And that's what we've been working on for some time now. I can confirm that we work closely with the United States of America, and Joe Biden and I are working closely together as well.We are prepared for all kinds of situation. And that's part of what we do when we say we prepare sanctions. That means we need to be able to react at any time, and this is happening.With regard to the use of LNG, I can say that the biggest volume of LNG used across the world is the gas, and that is part of the debate.Concerning a long-term perspective, I already outlined what this is about. We will modernize our economy. And where gas is being used, we will switch to hydrogen. This will be a process that will happen faster than many might imagine today, and that will create a bright future for all of us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "label": "Explicit"}

And he—Louis—he is working very hard.But as you know, the Democrats aren't approving the proper funding for Postal, and they're not approving the proper funding for this ridiculous thing that they want to do, which is all mail-in voting.

Far more—just look at New York. Look at New Jersey. Look at the catastrophe in New Jersey. And New Jersey had more than just Paterson. Look at what's going on in Virginia. Look at what's happening with this mail-in voting. It's a disgrace. Absentee is good; mail-in, universal, is very, very bad. There's no way they're going to get it accurately. They're off by 20 and 30 percent. And this is beyond Post Office.Now, with that being said, they want money for the universal mail-in ballots, and they're not getting it. You know why? Because of them. We want money to go to people. They want money in order to bail out States that have done very poorly. The States that have done poorly, you know them as well as I do, these are run by Democrats, usually radical-left Democrats.You take a look at what's happening in Portland. And we'll go into Portland—we have to be asked—we'll go into Portland, straighten it out in 1 hour, like happened in Minneapolis. We'll go straighten it out in 1 hour.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in reflecting on the conclusion of this conflict, can you justify the significant human and financial expenditures, considering that Afghanistan has not fully realized the initial reconstruction and democracy objectives? President Karzai, do you maintain your assertion that foreign influence is a primary driver of Afghanistan's corruption and inadequate governance, and are you fully committed to relinquishing your presidency after next year's elections? [SEP] Let us not forget the impetus behind our intervention in Afghanistan. Three thousand Americans were brutally murdered by a terrorist organization operating freely within its borders. It was imperative that we pursue that organization and the government that harbored it. Thanks to the valor of our armed forces and the collaboration of Afghan allies, we have largely achieved our primary objective: to incapacitate Al Qaida and prevent future attacks against us. Our actions have been guided by this aim. We can confidently state that the sacrifices made by our service members have enabled us to achieve this goal. We also recognized the importance of a stable, sovereign Afghanistan that could serve as a responsible partner. This necessitated the development of Afghanistan's own security capabilities and a trajectory toward prosperity and peace. While Afghanistan still faces challenges, the prospects for peace and prosperity are greater now than before our intervention, owing in part to American sacrifices. Did we achieve all of our loftiest aspirations? Perhaps not, as human endeavors often fall short of perfection. However, did we achieve our core objective? Have we forged a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government willing to cooperate in preventing future attacks against the United States? We are in the process of achieving that goal. We extend our gratitude to our military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel, as well as the Afghan government and people. Regarding corruption, yes, it exists in Afghanistan, and we are actively combating it. While we have made progress, we are not complacent. On the issue of foreign-sourced corruption, I have been unequivocal: Afghanistan requires the cooperation of its international partners to address the shortcomings in the delivery of assistance. As for elections, my greatest legacy will be a fair and transparent election in which the Afghan people can freely choose their next leader. I will then retire, content in my service.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, does the United States plan to maintain a permanent military footprint in Iraq? Furthermore, would you be willing to explicitly disavow any ambition to establish permanent bases there? [SEP] Jim, the decision regarding any enduring presence in Iraq rests solely with the Iraqi government. Their immediate priority is achieving near-term stability, and they require our assistance to that end. Consequently, our efforts are concentrated on providing that support. It is crucial to remember that we are engaging with a sovereign nation. We have existing agreements with the Karzai government that delineate arrangements for a U.S. presence, contingent upon their continued desire for it. In due course, we will engage in discussions regarding the long-term security of Iraq. However, our present focus is on stabilizing Baghdad and addressing Al Qaeda's violent activities in Al Anbar Province. It is noteworthy that the perception of widespread sectarian conflict throughout Iraq is inaccurate. General Casey reported that 90% of the conflict is localized to 5 of the 18 provinces, primarily within a 30-mile radius of Baghdad. Despite the grim portrayal on television, many Iraqis are leading relatively normal lives. Farmers are cultivating their land, small businesses are expanding, the currency is reasonably stable, and there is a burgeoning entrepreneurial class. General Abizaid recounted his experiences visiting bustling markets in Baghdad. While significant challenges persist, many Iraqis aspire to normalcy, and Prime Minister Maliki bears the responsibility of ensuring their security.

{"sentence": "Q. And can you answer the filibuster—[inaudible]? [SEP] Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that—it used to be required for the filibuster—and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them—that it used to be that the—that from between 1917 to 1971—the filibuster existed—there were a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it's being abused in a gigantic way.And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are—are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote—like the basic right to vote. We've amended the filibuster in the past.But here's the deal: As you observed, I'm a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50/50 Senate, we've got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.And so I'm going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to—anyway—I—we're going to get a lot done. And if we have to—if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "President Bush, could you offer your insights on the projected duration and intensity of the economic downturn in the US, and its potential impact on Mexico? Also, what are your thoughts on President Calderon's proposed reforms in Mexico? And for all of you, what security concerns arise from the situation with NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia, particularly after Colombia's military action in Ecuador? [SEP] Well, let's be clear, we're not in a recession, we're experiencing a slowdown. We saw growth in the last quarter of the previous year. We don't have the figures for the first quarter yet, but there's no doubt, things have slowed down. And yes, people are understandably worried. I'm probably the most concerned of the three of us here, because it's my responsibility to look after the people I represent. That's why we worked with Congress to pass a significant economic stimulus package, which will provide rebates to our citizens starting in May. The package also includes incentives for businesses to invest in 2008. I believe this will have a positive effect on the economy, and experts agree. The key is for Congress not to raise taxes during this time, as that would send the wrong message. As for President Calderon, he's more than capable of handling reform. He's a good, honest man who cares deeply about Mexico, and he'll do what he believes is right for his country. And regarding President Uribe, we have no better friend in South America. He's a strong believer in the rule of law, a reformer, and he's working hard to protect his country from drug traffickers who commit terrible acts. He deserves our support. The United States supports him in many ways, but if we don't approve the free trade agreement we negotiated with Colombia in good faith, it will undermine his efforts and destabilize the region. It would be a mistake for Congress to turn its back on Colombia. Mexico is taking measures to address this economic slowdown in the US, which obviously affects us. Over 82 percent of our exports go to the US, so we're implementing an aggressive public expenditure and infrastructure program. We're increasing infrastructure spending from 3 percent of GDP to over 5.5 percent, which translates to about $500 billion for private-public programs this year. This is already showing up in the figures for the first quarter. We're also working on an anti-cyclical program with tax incentives for investment in the poorest regions of Mexico, offering 100-percent deductions on investments and covering all social security and labor costs for a year and a half. This is a very strong stimulus package. The initial data indicates a 4.25 percent growth rate for Mexico's economic activity. The figures for February and March show that industrial activity continues to grow at about 4 percent. It's a challenging time due to the interconnectedness of our economies, but we're prepared to face the situation and move forward, albeit at a slower pace. We're using all available government resources to accelerate the growth of the Mexican economy. I hope this situation doesn't last long and that the US authorities will be able to overcome it soon. I believe the measures taken by the fiscal and monetary authorities in the US, as well as the Bush administration, have been appropriate and will soon show positive results, leading to a quick recovery for all our economies. In Canada, despite the economic slowdown, our economy remains stable and solid. We've taken steps to ensure continued growth in the future. Regarding Colombia, Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with them. It's important for the US and Mexico to also benefit from free trade with Colombia. Last year, I said that Colombia can have drug trafficking with our countries without a free trade agreement, but if we want legitimate business for all our economies, we need to pursue free trade agreements with Colombia. I worry that if the US refuses this agreement with Colombia, it could create long-term problems for our countries in South America. We have an important alliance with Colombia, which is fighting against political violence, the FARC, and drug traffickers. Rejecting or turning our backs on such an ally could have long-term security consequences for all of our countries in North America. So, I do worry about that.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, could you elaborate on your perspective regarding the Pope's potential recognition of a Palestinian state and its potential ramifications for the pursuit of a two-state solution? [SEP] Well, first off, let me commend the Senate for their progress on granting me the authority to negotiate and finalize a smart, forward-thinking, and economically stimulating trade agreement with nations in the Asia-Pacific region, and potentially in Europe as well. This authority also equips me with the necessary mechanisms to enforce these agreements, something that has been lacking in the past. I extend my gratitude to all the Senators who supported this initiative, or at least initiated the debate to advance this process. To those who did not vote in favor, I will continue to present the rationale and provide the information needed to instill confidence that, despite past shortcomings in certain trade agreements, the approach we are adopting here is the correct one, not only for large U.S. corporations but also for small and medium-sized businesses, and most importantly, for American workers. I would not endorse any agreement that I did not believe would ultimately generate employment opportunities in the United States and provide increased opportunities for upward mobility, higher incomes, and improved wages for the American populace, as that remains my paramount objective since assuming office. The dynamic between myself and Elizabeth is purely professional. While the press may find amusement in highlighting disagreements on policy matters between close allies, I maintain strong relationships with numerous Senators and Representatives, including some of my earliest supporters, who hold differing views on this issue. I understand their perspective, as they, like myself, have witnessed plant closures and the relocation of jobs overseas. They share concerns regarding the effective enforcement of labor and environmental standards in international agreements, and whether trade practices are genuinely fair rather than merely free. Furthermore, they share a profound concern about global trends and domestic trends that have contributed to increased inequality, and the perceived impact of automation and globalization in enabling those at the upper echelons to thrive while wages and incomes for middle-class families and those striving to enter the middle class stagnate. These individuals share fundamentally aligned values with my own. I observed a recent progressive statement of principles articulated by some of these colleagues, which essentially mirrored my agenda, with the exception of trade. This divergence stems from a policy disagreement and a difference in analysis regarding what is most beneficial for our constituents. I firmly believe that, despite the shortcomings of previous trade agreements, we are better positioned to establish robust, high-standard regulations with stringent, enforceable provisions on matters such as child labor, deforestation, environmental degradation, wildlife trafficking, and intellectual property. We must establish these rules for what is projected to be the largest and fastest-growing market globally. Failure to do so will cede this opportunity to China and other nations, thereby disadvantaging our businesses and ultimately harming our workers. Regarding concerns about job outsourcing, my assessment indicates that companies seeking low-cost labor already have the means to outsource under the existing framework. This agreement presents an opportunity to incentivize companies to relocate manufacturing operations back to the United States. We are already witnessing instances of this trend. My visit to Nike, for example, highlighted their plans to potentially bring back 10,000 jobs due to advancements in manufacturing technologies. However, we must also ensure our ability to sell our products in these markets to fully capitalize on these opportunities. Therefore, my argument to my progressive colleagues is that we should prioritize areas of shared agreement, such as a strong minimum wage, robust job training programs, infrastructure investments to stimulate employment, stronger protections for collective bargaining, rigorous enforcement of overtime pay regulations, guaranteed paid sick leave, and an honest dialogue about our budget priorities to ensure that we are not sacrificing investments in the future to preserve loopholes for corporations that provide no economic benefit. These measures will effectively address the concerns they have raised. Obstructing this trade agreement will not, particularly given their acknowledgment that the current trade rules are detrimental to U.S. workers. If the existing rules are not serving our interests, how does maintaining the status quo benefit American workers? It defies logic. I fully support enforcement and the provisions that have been signed. I have expressed reservations regarding the drafting of the currency language in the bill, and I intend to consult with Senator Schumer and Sherrod Brown to explore potential modifications that would not inadvertently undermine our ability to maintain our own monetary policy.

Fortunately, we record these interviews now – a useful tool against 'fake news.' The Prime Minister will make her own decision. My only concern is that it doesn't hinder trade. We want to trade with the U.K., and they want to trade with us. We're their biggest partner, by far. Huge potential to expand that. If they choose a different path – and they want independence, which is their right – I simply hope trade with the U.S. remains possible.

He is wrestling with the perceived loss of the Soviet empire. He seeks his place between China and the West. I anticipate some form of incursion; he feels compelled to act.

Given heightened tensions and China's recent seizure of an underwater drone, do you believe our China policy requires reevaluation? What are your thoughts on direct communication with Taiwan's leader, and are you concerned about potential conflict with China due to such unconventional approaches? [SEP] Well, it's a complex issue. I see both sides. Any administration should re-examine foreign policy. I'm proud of my work, and experience is valuable, but fresh perspectives are beneficial. Democracy benefits from new viewpoints. A new president should assess past actions. That's what I did. Given the US-China relationship's importance to the global economy, national security, and Asia-Pacific presence, it demands careful consideration. Conflict would harm everyone. So, a review is warranted. I've advised the President-elect to approach foreign policy systematically. There's only one president at a time. I suggested assembling a full team, briefing them on past events, potential pitfalls, and opportunities before engaging with foreign governments. This ensures informed decisions and unified government action. Regarding Taiwan, there's a long-standing agreement among China, the US, and Taiwan to maintain the status quo. Taiwan operates differently from mainland China, and China acknowledges this. Taiwan maintains autonomy. This uneasy peace allows Taiwan's economic success and self-determination.

Where do you see opportunities for Germany to contribute more globally? And Madam Chancellor, does Germany's economic strength translate into increased responsibilities on the world stage? [SEP] Well, the Medal of Freedom is certainly a testament to Chancellor Merkel's remarkable career. She's been an exceptional leader of the German economy and a champion of European unity. Her own life story embodies the overcoming of the past and the promise of a brighter future. Her past work alone merits this honor, and fortunately, she'll be around for quite some time to continue her outstanding contributions.

She's not finished yet; she has much more to accomplish. She might appreciate a day off now and then, but that will have to wait. As for myself, standing here today receiving the Medal of Freedom prompts reflection on German unification in 1989. Germany entered a new phase, a reunited country with all rights and obligations. In the early 1990s, we struggled to send ships to the Adriatic for reconnaissance missions. Comparing that to today, we've come a long way in assuming international responsibility.

I just looked—there are thousands of boats in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Thousands and thousands of boats. It's called Boaters for Trump, Boaters for Trump-Pence. There's signs all over. Some of the boats have 10 flags on them. They're incredible. There are thousands. We did nothing to do this. This is just generic. It just happened.Let me just tell you, I think the level of enthusiasm for what we're doing—we want law and order. We want low taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to get rid of—they want to have open borders. And they want to defund the police. How do you win on that? They want to go to Texas, and they want to go to Pennsylvania, and they want to stop fracking. And Ohio, they want to stop fracking.

I anticipate an eventual shift, but we have yet to deploy the most stringent sanctions. We retain the option to escalate, and all avenues remain open. However, our current sanctions are, shall we say, moderate. We possess the capacity to intensify them should the need arise.

In the end, it was resolved the same way it would have been without the shutdown. So, it's a waste of time, and I think McConnell and Boehner get that. This brings me to a bigger point: Disagreement is part of the game in a democracy. Our system, unlike a parliamentary one, can have a Congress of one party and a President of another, leading to serious disagreements. So how do we handle it? The smart way is to say, 'Here's what we disagree on, we'll fight for our side, and then we'll work together on what we agree on.' That's how it's always been, even with Reagan and a Democratic Congress. They didn't refuse to work with him on Social Security or taxes just because they disagreed on other stuff. They fought on some things, worked together on others, and the country moved forward. I expect the same now.

What measures are in place to prevent this, and what kind of Middle East do you envision leaving behind as your term concludes?

We've established mechanisms under international law to intercept Iranian arms shipments, stemming from UN resolutions tied to their nuclear program. While the original resolution's text might suggest lifting these prohibitions upon a nuclear agreement, we negotiated extensions: five years for arms and eight for ballistic missiles. We also have other UN resolutions and agreements allowing us to interdict these shipments. These legal authorities, though, aren't self-enforcing. It requires intelligence and interdiction capacity. We must partner more effectively to improve these capabilities. Beyond legal authorities, we have unilateral sanctions in place. As for the broader Middle East, my goal is to leave behind a region where ISIS is contained, the Syrian civil war is being addressed, Iraq is functioning more effectively, and security partnerships are strengthened, including with Israel.

{"sentence": "Q. When you were in Baghdad 6 months ago, you expressed the same kind of confidence in the Prime Minister and his Government that you've expressed today. Yet there have been repeated rounds of disappointments when it comes to the Prime Minister's Baghdad Security Plan, with his plans for reconciliation. I'm wondering, if anything, if you've had any doubts over the last 6 months about the strength of his Government, about the Prime Minister's own abilities. And what gives you such confidence today to think that he can achieve what he hasn't done over the last 6 months? [SEP] Well, as you mentioned, he's been in power for 6 months, and I've been able to watch a leader emerge. The first thing that gives me confidence is that he wants responsibility. A sign of leadership is for somebody to say, I want to be able to have the tools necessary to protect my people. One of his frustrations with me is that he believes we've been slow about giving him the tools necessary to protect the Iraqi people. And today we had a meeting that will accelerate the capacity for the Prime Minister to do the hard work necessary to help stop this violence. No question, it's a violent society right now. He knows that better than anybody. He was explaining to me that occasionally the house in which he lives gets shelled by terrorists who are trying to frighten him.And so the second point I make to you is that I appreciate his courage. You can't lead unless you have courage. And he's got courage, and he's shown courage over the last 6 months.Thirdly, he has expressed a deep desire to unify his country. You hear all kinds of rumors about the politics inside of Iraq. I'm talking to the man face to face, and he says that he understands that a unified government, a pluralistic society, is important for success. And he's making hard decisions to achieve that.No question, it's been tough. It would have been a lot easier had people not tried to destabilize the young democracy. His job would have been more simple had there not been terrorists trying to create sectarian violence.Now, I want everybody to remember that it was Mr. Zarqawi of Al Qaida who said, Let us bomb Shi'a in order to create the conditions necessary for sectarian violence. The Samarra bombing started off this new phase of violence. The Prime Minister comes in about halfway through that phase in order to—he'd been selected, and now he's dealing with a serious situation on the ground. And what I appreciate is his attitude. As opposed to saying, America, you go solve the problem, we have a Prime Minister who's saying, Stop holding me back. I want to solve the problem.And the meeting today was to accelerate his capacity to do so. It's not easy for a military to evolve from ground zero, and I appreciate our forces and I appreciate General Casey, who have worked very hard to train the Iraqis so they become a capable fighting force as well as a unifying element for Iraq. But it's one thing to put people in uniform and another thing to have clear command structure, or the capacity to move troops from point A to point B, or the capacity to make sure that the troop carrier from point A to point B has got the necessary air in its tires or oil in its engine. In other words, this is a sophisticated operation, to get a unifying army stood up.And one of the reasons I appreciate the Prime Minister is that he, on the one hand, sees that it's a sophisticated operation to get a military up from zero, but on the other hand, is frustrated by the pace. And the reason why he's frustrated is because he wants to show the people who elected him that he is willing to take the hard tasks on necessary to provide security for the Iraqi people, such as hunting down those who are killing the innocent. And the reason I came today to be able to sit down with him is to hear the joint plans developed between the Iraqi Government, the sovereign Government of Iraq, and our Government, to make sure that we accelerate the transfer of capacity to the Prime Minister. And I know he's looking forward to more capacity being transferred so he can do his job.Anyway, he's the right guy for Iraq, and we're going to help him, and it's in our interest to help him, for the sake of peace.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, in your meeting with Prime Minister Najib, given the serious allegations of corruption and human rights violations, what specific concerns did you raise regarding the 1MDB scandal and the imprisonment of political opponents? [SEP] First, let's discuss the refugee program. The Paris attacks occurred only a week ago. The news cycle is so rapid that we sometimes lose track of events. The Paris attacks were recent and impactful, and people are understandably concerned given the similarities between Paris and many American cities. That's why the House acted quickly. I hope that now that we have had some time to pause and consider, people will recognize that refugees arriving in the United States undergo the most thorough vetting process. The process, developed over several administrations on a bipartisan basis, is exceptionally thorough and typically takes 18 to 24 months for approval. The House legislation, while seemingly straightforward, could effectively shut down the refugee program if it becomes overly bureaucratic. Adding layers of bureaucracy that don't enhance screening but make processing impossible would be counterproductive. When I spoke of betraying our values, I was referring to suggestions of prioritizing Christian refugees over Muslims, or fearing a 4-year-old orphan. Those of you who visited the refugee center and saw the children understand who we're talking about. If you're a parent and you saw those children, you'd understand that we need to provide them with a home in America. Most people, knowing the screening process, would agree. Regarding Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on investigations within the United States, and I certainly won't comment on foreign investigations. However, I did emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and combating corruption with Prime Minister Najib, as I have with leaders in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These are obstacles to development and contribute to poverty and stunted growth. Countries that address these issues will prosper, regardless of resources or geography. I also emphasized the importance of civil society and a free press. Countries are at different stages of development, and we don't expect everyone to follow the same path as the United States. But some fundamental principles are important for us to uphold as friends and partners. Consider Myanmar, which recently held a historic election after 40 years of military rule. They won't become Sweden overnight, but there's a significant shift occurring, and we want to encourage that. Our work through the Open Government Partnership and TPP is designed to raise the bar. Some will advance, some will regress, but the overall direction is towards a world where ordinary people are treated fairly, there's rule of law, transparency, accountable governments, people's voices are heard, women are treated equally, and minorities are not discriminated against.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult not to notice that something has changed to the east of the borders of NATO; that, again, we are having to deal with the aggression with the use of armed forces against one's neighbor. A few years ago it was Georgia; now it is Ukraine, with a special focus on the Crimea. President Putin didn't hide it. He didn't hide that these were elements of the Russian Armed Forces, and that—this is something that we have to acknowledge. Just the same way Russia never hid that for the last 4 years it has increased its defense budget twofold. We, ourselves, have to ask a question, why? For what purpose? And what does it have to mean for member states of NATO?All of us are interested in Russia to get modernized so that it was possible to do not only good business modernizing Russia, but also develop relations of good neighborhood and cooperation in many dimensions, in many areas. But today we have to answer to this situation that has come up by supporting independence of Ukraine and its right to choose its pro-Western direction. We have to support the modernization of Ukraine too.I am convinced that this is the right way to develop the mechanism and a source of a very good and suggestive example for the Russian society, just as a great example for them was the development of democracy in Poland—free market, prosperity, security, safety. It acted very well on Ukraine, and I am convinced that it was simply an element of the Ukrainian dreams to follow along the same way, in the direction of the same values.I am also convinced that the success of Ukraine, its democratic and independent nature, combined with overcoming the economic crisis and political crisis on the ground, combined with deep modernization of the Ukrainian society and state, will have a huge influence on the shaping of the attitudes of people within the Russian society. It is difficult not to notice today that the Russian public opinion has fully supported the aggressive behavior of President Putin in Crimea. The point is that a public opinion in Russia should stand on the side of the prospects for the modernization of Russia and not at the reconstitution of any zone of influence and any dreams of empire.Ladies and gentlemen, this press conference is over.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of China's expulsion of Wall Street Journal reporters, what retaliatory options are currently being evaluated by your administration?

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding China, you stated yesterday before business leaders your desire for them to adhere to established rules. Subsequently, your staff indicated that you voiced concerns to President Hu about American business leaders' increasing frustration with the slow pace of economic reform in China. Could you clarify which specific rules China is currently violating? What concrete actions do you expect from China, and what punitive measures is your administration prepared to implement if China fails to comply? [SEP] Look, let's be clear, we aren't against China's rise. A prosperous China that lifts its people is good for the world. What we've been doing for the past two years is fostering a candid dialogue. This has brought benefits, like support on the North Korea issue. However, I've consistently told Chinese leaders that their economic practices disadvantage many, not just us. Take their currency, the RMB. Experts say it's undervalued by a significant margin, making our exports pricier and their imports cheaper. While there's been slight improvement due to our pressure, it's not enough. They need to move faster towards a market-based system. This isn't just about us; it's about their economy too. They're too focused on exports and not enough on domestic consumption, making them vulnerable to global shocks. It throws the whole world economy out of balance because they're not buying as much as they could be from other countries. Chinese leadership knows this, but it's politically difficult for them to change. But frankly, enough is enough. Then there's intellectual property. American companies constantly complain about their ideas not being protected in China. This hurts our competitive advantage. If they don't protect intellectual property, they become a low-cost producer without compensating the inventors. These issues aren't secrets. American companies often hesitate to speak up for fear of retaliation. I don't share that concern. We're also enforcing existing trade laws. We've brought cases, like the one on U.S. tires, and won. This benefits U.S. producers and creates jobs. We want to trade with China and maintain a constructive relationship, but we must insist they play by the same rules. We won't let them take advantage of us.", "label": "Implicit"}

Have you now concluded that that approach was wrong? [SEP] No, I strongly support a lighter, agile Army that can move quickly to meet the threats of the 21st century. I also supported his force posture review and recommendations to move forces out of previous bases that—you know, they were there for the Soviet threat, for example, in Europe. So he's introduced some substantive changes to the Pentagon, and I support them strongly.However, that doesn't necessarily preclude increasing end strength for the Army and the Marines. And the reason why I'm inclined to believe this is a good idea is because I understand that we're going to be in a long struggle against radicals and extremists, and we must make sure that our military has the capability to stay in the fight for a long period of time. I'm not predicting any particular theater, but I am predicting that it's going to take a while for the ideology of liberty to finally triumph over the ideology of hate.I know you know I feel this strongly, but I see this—we're in the beginning of a conflict between competing ideologies, a conflict that will determine whether or not your children can live in peace. A failure in the Middle East, for example, or failure in Iraq or isolationism will condemn a generation of young Americans to permanent threat from overseas. And therefore, we will succeed in Iraq. And therefore, we will help young democracies when we find them—democracies like Lebanon, hopefully a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel, the young democracy of Iraq.It is in our interest that we combine security with a political process that frees people, that liberates people, that gives people a chance to determine their own futures.

Violations of international law, such as chemical attacks or invasions, require a response, but not always military.

And also, Mr. President, what you think has actually changed with the arrival of Gordon Brown instead of Tony Blair? [SEP] Besides toothpaste? [] Do you want to—I'll start. Look, I think any time you share values the way we share values, it makes it easy to have strategic conversations; it makes it easy to be able to have common ground on which to deal with these problems. You just listed off a lot of problems. I happen to view them as great opportunities to begin to put conditions in place so that the world looks fundamentally different 50 years from now.But I would say that the relationship between Great Britain and America is our most important bilateral relationship, for a lot of reasons: trade. Great Britain has been attacked; we've been attacked, which caused us to lash up our intelligence services like never before. We have common interests throughout the world.But it's an important relationship primarily because we think the same. We believe in freedom and justice as fundamentals of life. There's no doubt in my mind that freedom is universal, that freedom is a gift to each man, woman, and child on the face of the Earth, and that with freedom comes peace. And there's no doubt in my mind, those of us who live under the free societies have an obligation to work together to promote it.And the man I listened to shares that same sense of morality and that same sense of obligation, not to free others, but to create the conditions so others can realize the blessings of freedom. We can't impose freedom, but we can eliminate roadblocks to freedom and to allow free societies to develop. And it's really hard work, you know?

It will be interesting to see--it will help, I think, give some insight as to how Russia intends to conduct foreign policy over--after Vladimir Putin's Presidency. And I can't answer the question yet. I can say that it's in our interests to continue to have relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation matters, it's in our interest to be able to make sure that materials that could cause great harm aren't proliferated. It's in our interest to work together on Iran. As I said, I think, in this room the last time I was here, I appreciated the fact that Vladimir Putin told the Iranians that they will provide--they, Russia--will provide enriched uranium to run the Bushehr power plant, thereby negating the need for the Iranians to enrich in the first place. I thought that was a constructive suggestion. And we need to be in a position to be able to work with Russia on Iran. There's a lot of areas where--yesterday, for example, with the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, I talked about a missile defense system in Europe. But I believe it's in our interests to try to figure out a way for the Russians to understand the system is not aimed at them but aimed at the real threats of the 21st century, which could be a launch from a violent regime--a launch of a weapon of mass destruction. So there's areas where--and so it's a--I'm going to try to leave it so whoever my successor is will be able to have a relationship with whoever is running foreign policy in Russia.

{"sentence": "Q. Two very quick questions, one for President Bush and the other for Prime Minister Berlusconi. Now, we know that you are in sound agreement. And, President Bush, I think that you were recently interviewed by my newscast, and you said that you were in favor of Italy being part of the 5-plus-1 group, which is handling the Iranian crisis issue.Now, Stephen Hadley said today that your position is that of waiting to see what might happen. Now, the White House was backing Italy's participation in the 5-plus1 group. So an answer on that.And, Prime Minister Berlusconi, will there be changes in Italy's presence in Afghanistan and other trouble spots after your talks with President Bush this afternoon? [SEP] [Inaudible]—the P-5plus-1. And I told Silvio I'd seriously consider it. I also made it clear, however, that all of us, P-5-plus-1 or not, need to be sending the same message to the Iranians, which is, verifiably suspend your enrichment program or else you will face further sanctions and further isolation. And the sad thing about this issue is that the Iranian people are suffering. They could be doing a lot better. Their lives could be much more hopeful, except their Government has made the decision to defy the demands of the free world, has made the decision to ignore the IAEA, and has continued to enrich in a way that we think is dangerous.And so the choice is theirs to make. Foreign Minister Solana is going to see the Iranianhere very shortly, and his message is one that—is the one I just delivered. And it's—I hope for the sake of the Iranian people that their Government changes course. There is a better way forward.I want to remind you something about this Iranian issue. Vladimir Putin, our mutual friend, went to the Iranians and said, you have a right to have civilian nuclear power. I have said the same thing publicly as well. I mean, I'm a big believer in nuclear power. I think the best way to deal with climate change is the spread of nuclear power. The best way to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy is nuclear power. And I believe Iran should have a civilian nuclear power. I don't believe they can be entrusted to enrich.And therefore, Vladimir Putin went and said—and he believes that—and he said, we'll provide the fuel for you, and we'll not only provide the fuel, we'll gather the spent fuel, so you don't need to enrich. So the argument of the Iranian Government that we have a right to have civilian nuclear power has been undermined by the Russian proposal.And so it will be interesting to see their decision. But what they need to hear is, is that we are firm in our resolve to prevent them from having the capacity to make a nuclear weapon. And with regard to the question addressed to me, we've offered to join the other European countries, plus China, plus Russia, in order to make our contribution to the negotiations which are underway with the Iranian Government. Now, our offer is based on the fact that we know Iran very well from the inside. We have some leading companies that are operating in these countries, and therefore, we think that this would be very useful in helping President Bush and Vladimir Putin to pursue the strategy that they've determined for that country.Now, we obviously need to make sure that nuclear energy is being used for only peaceful reasons. With regard to the sanctions proposed by the United Nations, we have always abided by those. And the presence of our businesses have to do with agreements and contracts which date back several years.Now, with regard to our willingness to remove or lift any caveats with regard to Afghanistan, we discussed that. And we also said that we are willing to keep our troops in other fronts, as it were, in other areas— in Kosovo and Lebanon and wherever it is that our Italian soldiers are today.And I thank President Bush for his appreciation and acknowledgment of the Italian commitment in these international fronts. And in fact, there are 40,000 troops that are currently operating in our foreign missions. And we—there—we obviously have a turnover, and we always manage to keep that very large number of troops there. And we will continue, therefore, to pursue this, because we are fully convinced that it is extremely important to be able to establish democracy in Iraq. This is a very important country in that region, and we'll obviously continue to pursue our other efforts. And we obviously back any agreement that will help us to overcome any divisions in Lebanon.And we're also working on the agreements—on the negotiations for an agreement in Israel and the Middle East. And we are hoping that in all these countries it will be possible to establish peace and that they will certainly be able to become fully established democracies.The second Italian journalist is from ANSA, the leading news agency.", "label": "Explicit"}

The existing structure is antiquated, poorly constructed, and frankly, hazardous! Panels are detaching, and concrete is crumbling. They considered relocating it far from DC, but I emphasized the necessity of proximity to the Justice Department. The present location is optimal.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a moment ago about what you won't do in terms of your negotiations with Republicans. But I'm interested in what you've signaled you already might do. In particular, by conceding in these negotiations to some form of a cap or freezing spending, are you concerned that Mr. McCarthy has already forced you into accepting a policy position that could tip this economy into a recession? [SEP] No, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told you—and you may be aware or you've seen it—we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.And secondly, we're in a situation where the—let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, Okay, we have to make some cuts, would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income—what was coming in the door—to determine what you could afford?And so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as—as well as—cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the—my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are—we've provided for the number of—we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America—very complicated stuff.It's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between—we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.And there's a lot of other—for example, the idea that we're—in terms of taxes—that they refuse to—for example, we—I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill—anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.And—because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty—$400 billion—or $40 billion—$400 billion—that they—they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes. What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.And like I said, we're now down to—we went from somewhere—roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table.

How do you respond to those who say the election outcome, at least in part, was voters saying that they see you as out of touch with their personal economic pain?

I mean, folks didn't have any complaints about my leadership style when I was running around Iowa for a year. And they got a pretty good look at me up close and personal, and they were able to lift the hood and kick the tires. And I think they understood that my story was theirs. I might have a funny name, I might have lived in some different places, but the values of hard work and responsibility and honesty and looking out for one another that had been instilled in them by their parents, those were the same values that I took from my mom and my grandparents.And so the track record has been that when I'm out of this place, that's not an issue. When you're in this place, it is hard not to seem removed. And one of the challenges that we've got to think about is how do I meet my responsibilities here in the White House, which require a lot of hours and a lot of work, but still have that opportunity to engage with the American people on a day-to-day basis and know--give them confidence that I'm listening to them.Those letters that I read every night, some of them just break my heart. Some of them provide me encouragement and inspiration. But nobody's filming me reading those letters. And so it's hard, I think, for people to get a sense of, well, how's he taking in all this information?So I think there are more things that we can do to make sure that I'm getting out of here. But, I mean, I think it's important to point out as well that a couple of great communicators, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, were standing at this podium 2 years into their Presidency getting very similar questions because the economy wasn't working the way it needed to be and there were a whole range of factors that made people concerned that maybe the party in power wasn't listening to them.This is something that I think every President needs to go through, because the responsibilities of this office are so enormous and so many people are depending on what we do, and in the rush of activity, sometimes we lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place.And that's something that--now, I'm not recommending for every future President that they take a shellacking like they--like I did last night. [] I'm sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons. But I do think that this is a growth process and an evolution. And the relationship that I've had with the American people is one that built slowly, peaked at this incredible high, and then during the course of the last 2 years, as we've, together, gone through some very difficult times, has gotten rockier and tougher. And it's going to, I'm sure, have some more ups and downs during the course of me being in this office.But the one thing that I just want to end on is getting out of here is good for me too, because when I travel around the country, even in the toughest of these debates--in the midst of health care last year during summer when there were protesters about, and when I'm meeting families who've lost loved ones in Afghanistan or Iraq--I always come away from those interactions just feeling so much more optimistic about this country.We have such good and decent people who, on a day-to-day basis, are finding all kinds of ways to live together and educate kids and grow their communities and improve their communities and create businesses and work together to create great new products and services. The American people always make me optimistic.And that's why, during the course of the last 2 years, as tough as it's been, as many sometimes scary moments as we've gone through, I've never doubted that we're going to emerge stronger than we were before. And I think that remains true, and I'm just going to be looking forward to playing my part in helping that journey along.All right. Thank you very much, everybody.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in July, your budget office projected a 7.7% unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2012. Will this new package reduce that projection? And will it stimulate growth and job creation more effectively than the Recovery Act? [SEP] Well, this package isn't as big of a boost as the Recovery Act, but we're in a different situation now. Back then, we were staring down a potential Great Depression, with unemployment possibly hitting 15 or 20 percent. We don't know. Thanks to our efforts to stabilize the financial system and the Federal Reserve's actions, that's behind us. We're not facing a double-dip recession. Now, the economy is growing, company profits are up, and we're seeing some private sector job growth, but it's not happening fast enough to bring down the unemployment rate, given the 8 million jobs we lost before and as I took office. So, this package provides an extra boost, bigger than most economists expected. Some are already suggesting we might see faster growth and more jobs because of it. The payroll tax holiday will help, and unemployment insurance has a big impact on keeping the recovery going strong. Overall, economists agree this will help economic and job growth in the coming months. That's the main reason I made this decision. We need to remember, especially my fellow Democrats who care deeply about middle-class, working, and low-income families: the best jobs program is a growing economy. The best anti-poverty program is making sure people have jobs and the economy is growing. We can do other things, but if the economy isn't growing and the private sector isn't hiring faster, we'll keep having problems, no matter what programs we put in place. That's why I looked at our options and decided that another 3, 4, or 5 months of uncertainty would hurt people who see their paychecks shrink and those who rely on unemployment insurance to pay their bills.

[SEP] So I'm very satisfied because they're investing tremendous amounts of money. I met Mr. Patel a little while ago. He's the largest steel person in the world by far. I don't think there's even a contest. And he's going to be building a billion-dollar plant in Alabama.We had the press—I left them in there. Always a risky thing to do. But if you—if you see the—let's say we ask—you know, answered 15 questions, and they were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now, in terms of their investment. They have done a fantastic job.These are some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I'm not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they've done is incredible. But Mr. Patel, who's the biggest steel—I think biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual. But I think he's the biggest steel company by a lot. He's investing billions of dollars in the United States, and he's only doing it because of what I've done to bring back the steel industry. The steel industry was dead. Absolutely dead in the United States. And now it's a vibrant industry. It's incredible, and we need it. Again, we need it for defense. It's not just like certain industries that you don't need. We need it for defense.But he was glowing. And one of the reasons he's spending a billion dollars in Alabama, and more money in other places in the United States, is because we brought it back. So we're very proud of that.So I think what we'll do is we're going to see some of you on the plane on the way back. It's been an honor to be here. It's an incredible place with incredible leadership and an unbelievable future.And I just want to thank you all. And I'll see you back in the States.

They voiced their concerns about the Iraq war, which are shared by many. I reminded them that polls last fall indicated widespread disapproval of the situation in Iraq. I, too, would have expressed disapproval at that time. That's why I implemented a plan to improve the situation. I explained my decision-making process and emphasized that General Petraeus has a plan that some Members of Congress are hindering. It's illogical to unanimously confirm him and then deny him the resources needed to succeed. We must give General Petraeus a chance. He will report back to the Secretary, the Joint Chiefs, the White House, and Congress on the effectiveness of the strategy. We will then respond accordingly. Decisions about our posture in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, and General Petraeus is best suited to assess those conditions. Upon his recommendation, along with the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs, we will respond. Let's wait and see what happens and give this plan a chance to work. Let's avoid playing politics and support our troops. It's one thing to have an honest debate about Iraq, but it's another to involve our troops in that debate. They deserve the necessary funding and flexibility. This cause is necessary and noble, which is why I deployed them in the first place. It's essential for our nation's peace and security. It's noble that these citizens volunteer to serve. Congress must support them. While debating strategies is acceptable, ensuring timely funding is crucial.

First, the man you met today, Kim Jong Un, as you know, has killed family members, has starved his own people, is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier. Why are you so comfortable calling him very talented? [SEP] Well, he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it and run it tough—I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it—he ran it. Very few people, at that age—you can take 1 out of 10,000, probably, couldn't do it.Otto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life.

Is the U.S. contributing enough to global vaccinations, or should American children wait until adults in other countries are vaccinated? [SEP] Did you say all that in one breath? I thought we agreed on two questions each. Anyway, about Hong Kong, the situation there is getting worse. China isn't keeping its promises, so the advisory is just to warn businesses about potential problems. Simple as that. As for Build Back Better, am I confident? Absolutely! It'll all work out perfectly. The media keeps saying my plans are dead, but they're wrong. I still think we'll get the infrastructure deal done. I trust the Republican Senators who made commitments. They're honorable people. And reconciliation is how we get all the Democrats on board. Today, if you make under $150,000 and have kids, you'll get a tax cut, a monthly payment like Social Security.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, after previously describing the 2010 midterms as a 'shellacking,' how would you characterize the outcome of this election? Moreover, can you provide an update on your planned immigration executive order? Has the election altered your timeline for its release, and is it still expected before the end of the lame-duck session? Has the scope of the order been narrowed? [SEP] Well, as I stated in my opening remarks, there's no denying that the Republicans had a successful election night. Our priority now is to engage with Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, who will be leading both chambers of Congress, to understand their legislative priorities. My hope is that we can identify areas of common ground and work together to address the pressing issues facing the American people. The resounding message from this election, and indeed from recent elections, is that the public wants action. They want us to focus on their concerns, not on partisan politics. They want us to address the challenges facing single mothers, young people burdened with student debt, and construction workers struggling to find employment. If we keep those individuals in mind, I believe we can achieve meaningful progress. Regarding immigration, I've consistently maintained that my preference is for Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Such legislation should strengthen our borders, streamline our legal immigration system, and provide a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have lived here for many years and have strong ties to our communities. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill that, while not perfect, represented a significant step forward. I urged John Boehner to bring that bill to a vote in the House, but unfortunately, he was unable to do so. Therefore, I feel obligated to use my executive authority to take action to improve our immigration system, while making it clear that any executive actions I take will be superseded by congressional action. That's a commitment I've made to the American people and to Speaker Boehner. Before the end of the year, I intend to take whatever lawful actions I can to enhance the functioning of our immigration system and to allocate additional resources to border security. I'll also be reaching out to Republican and Democratic leaders to explore how we can move forward on this issue. If they're willing to work with me to pass a bill, I'm eager to engage in that process. However, I won't simply wait for Congress to act. I believe I've demonstrated considerable patience and a willingness to work on a bipartisan basis, and I'll continue to do so. But in the meantime, we must do what we can to improve the system through executive action.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of recent events, what advice would you give to those protesting against perceived injustices? Have you counseled your successor on the importance of careful staff selection? And in your final weeks, can you prevent further violence in Aleppo? Chancellor Merkel, given the contrasting views of Trump, what message do you have for Americans? [SEP] Well, a cornerstone of our democracy is the right to protest. I've been the target of protests during my time in office, as have many presidents before me. So, I wouldn't tell people who feel strongly about the issues raised during the campaign to be silent. What I would advise, and have advised, is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matters. I consistently tell young people, both in the U.S. and abroad, don't take our systems of government and way of life for granted. Because we've lived in a relatively stable and peaceful era, with improving living standards, there's a tendency to assume it will always be this way. But it's not. Democracy is hard work. In the U.S., if 43 percent of eligible voters don't vote, democracy is weakened. If we're not serious about facts, especially in an age of social media where information is consumed in soundbites, if we can't distinguish between serious arguments and propaganda, we have problems. If people, regardless of their political leanings, are unwilling to compromise and demonize opponents, democracy will break down. So, my advice is to understand the foundations of a healthy democracy and how to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us or during an election. It's hard work. The good news is, many young people who were involved in my campaigns continue to be involved in work, both politically and through nonprofits, that can carry this hard work forward. But there's sometimes complacency. Here in Europe, many young people forget the Cold War and the significance of the Berlin Wall. And I'll be honest, I've heard rhetoric in Europe that draws a false equivalence between the U.S. and Russia, and between how our governments operate versus other governments. Those distinctions are important. I've said many times that, like any government, we have flaws, we've operated imperfectly, we've made mistakes. There are times when I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned with our values. It's a work of constant improvement. But I can say to the German people that the U.S. has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And across Europe, many principles taken for granted here – free speech, civil liberties, an independent judiciary, and fighting corruption – are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we've tried to apply not just in our own country, but also in our foreign policy. That should be remembered. Because in an age of active misinformation, packaged attractively and appearing the same on Facebook or TV, where overzealousness by a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems the same and no distinctions are made, we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of democratic freedoms, market-based economies, and prosperity that we've come to take for granted. That was a long answer, wasn't it? I don't remember if there was a second part to it. I got all caught up in that one.", "label": "Implicit"}

The focus of the upcoming NATO meeting, and indeed the next two years, will be on ensuring a seamless transition, avoiding any abrupt cliff-like scenarios. We'll be establishing clear benchmarks and milestones along the way, mirroring our approach in Iraq, to ensure a measured and effective transfer of authority. Now, the Koran burning incident is undoubtedly a matter of concern. It underscores the inherent challenges within that environment and reinforces the urgency of our transition efforts. The violence directed towards our personnel is, of course, unacceptable, and President Karzai has acknowledged this. However, President Karzai is also eager to assume greater responsibility on the Afghan side. We're committed to identifying a mechanism that respects Afghan sovereignty while empowering them to take on an increasingly significant role in their own security.

We must address the root causes of migration by investing in development in countries with inequality and poverty. Migration should be an option, not a necessity.

But can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the Presidency?

But there's been some fantastic books written that just came out—whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy's book that just came out recently, and so many other books. I mean, a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they've done to this country is a disgrace. They've hurt this country very badly. And no other President should have to go through what I've gone through.The President—the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There's a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption. I just told you about Senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is, I didn't do it. You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden, and there was with these Senators. And they threatened. They said: You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes. That's—that's the real deal. So we have an honest group of people that have been maligned. And you know, it's—a lot of people say I'll do even better. I'm very happy.

Not perfect, but with a functional government capable of stopping ethnic cleansing. There's criminality, too, and we must help Iraqis build a police force. Al Qaeda is present, responsible for some bombings. Zarqawi fueled sectarian violence. Disaffected Sunnis seek to regain power through violence. It's complex, regardless of what you call it.

I empathize with this situation, and that is why I consistently express my gratitude to them. Your inquiry is based on conversations with specific individuals, perhaps a single individual.

Are you concerned that the United States is losing credibility in the world and now may be seen as the boy who tried—who called wolf? [SEP] Actually, I am—I want to compliment the intelligence community for their good work. Right after the failure of intelligence in Iraq, we reformed the intel community so that there was a lot of serious considerations of NIEs in a way that would give us confidence. And here's a, I think, a very important product that is a result of the reforms we've put in place. As a matter of fact, the American people should have confidence that the reforms are working and that this work on the intel community is important work.People said, Well, why is it that you can't get exact knowledge quicker? Well, the answer is, is because we're dealing with a regime that is not very transparent, and frankly, we haven't had a very good presence in since 1979. And that's why I instructed the intel community to beef up its intelligence on . So we could have a better sense for what they're thinking and what they're doing. And this product is a result of intelligence reform and, more importantly, the good, hard work of our intelligence community.One of the reasons why this is out in the public arena is because I wanted—and our administration believed that, one, it was important for people to know the facts as we see them; secondly, that members of my administration had been very clear about the weapons program earlier this year.

He's paying a steep price for his failure, but he's inflicting unspeakable carnage on Ukrainian civilians, bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes. It's sickening. That being said, I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. Let me choose my words carefully: I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if he shows a genuine interest in finding a way to end this war. He hasn't done that yet. If that happens, in consultation with our allies, I'll gladly sit down with him to see what he has in mind. But he hasn't taken that step. In the meantime, it's crucial that we support the Ukrainian people. The idea that Putin can defeat Ukraine is incomprehensible. Imagine trying to occupy that country for years to come. He's miscalculated at every turn. He thought he'd be welcomed by Russian speakers. Go back and read his speech when he invaded. He talked about being another Peter the Great, about Kyiv being the motherload of Russian identity. He's miscalculated across the board. So, the question is, how does he get himself out of this mess?

The critical factor is the overall trajectory of Afghan capabilities. Kabul, with a significant portion of the population, is largely under Afghan control, and they've demonstrated considerable improvement. While such events may persist for a while, our work is ongoing. As I've said, we're shifting to a transition phase, mirroring our experience in Iraq. Despite the withdrawal of our troops, Iraq has sustained a democratic government and reduced violence. We believe a similar strategy is viable in Afghanistan.

Did you adopt President Trump's hard-line stance? And do you believe the other signatories to the agreement will follow suit? [SEP] When I said 'no Plan B,' I was referring to the lack of a 'Planet B' in the context of climate change, not Iran. Regarding Iran, my position has been consistent. As I mentioned at the UN General Assembly in September, the JCPOA is a starting point, but we need to address three additional areas: the post-2025 sunset clauses, ballistic missile development, and regional influence. The future of the JCPOA is uncertain, and that decision rests with others. The JCPOA represents the first pillar of the framework I've outlined. I'm not suggesting a complete overhaul, but rather an expansion. While my criticisms of the JCPOA haven't been as strong as some, I believe we can build upon it. Regardless of the ultimate decision, I want to collaborate on a new agreement with four pillars, encompassing the existing JCPOA provisions related to current nuclear activities, long-term nuclear activities, ballistic missiles, and regional influence. This has been my consistent stance. In recent weeks, we've engaged in detailed discussions on this topic, including the regional situation. I believe we've reached a shared understanding of the situations in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. We recognize that the nuclear issue is not isolated and that Iran's ballistic missile activities and regional presence are problematic. Our goal is to foster regional stability. By achieving this convergence, the idea of a new agreement that includes a solution for Syria becomes a significant step forward, thanks to our discussions. I hope to collaborate with all our partners. Our Foreign Ministers have already convened a small group and will continue to do so. The aim is for allied powers, including ourselves, and regional powers to work together within this group. We'll also engage in privileged discussions with Russia and Turkey on regional issues, including Syria. Moving forward, we'll use this approach to work towards a comprehensive agreement. I believe we can reconcile our shared views and differences, as we're not operating in a vacuum. I've always maintained that we shouldn't dismantle the JCPOA without a replacement. That would be counterproductive. Instead, we should aim for a broader agreement covering the four areas I mentioned. This approach allows us to address concerns and criticisms of the JCPOA, which, as I've noted, was supported by a previous US administration. We can work together while respecting the sovereignty of the region's states. It's not about interventionism, but about building a stable framework that promotes stability and peace.

Some critics argue that this represents a capitulation to hardliners who seek to dismantle the existing deal.

[SEP] Let me be absolutely clear: my commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon remains unwavering. The JCPOA was a flawed agreement, but it did achieve some important objectives. However, it failed to address critical issues such as ballistic missile development and Iran's destabilizing activities in the region. We cannot simply ignore these threats.

I avoid commenting on daily currency fluctuations. Regarding Greece, our G-7 partners, the IMF, and others recognize the urgency of a solution. Greece must commit to reforms, not just for creditors, but to foster economic growth. They need tough political choices for the long term.

You also said in that interview that you can stop them. How do you plan on stopping them from charging this $5 fee or whatever the fee is? And do you think that your Government has a right to dictate how much profits American companies make? [SEP] I absolutely do not think that. I was trying to make a broader point, which is that people have been using financial regulation as an excuse to charge consumers more. Right? I mean, basically the argument they've made is, well, you know what, this hidden fee was prohibited, and so we'll find another fee to make up for it. Now, they have that right, but it's not a good practice. It's not necessarily fair to consumers. And my main goal is to make sure that we've got a consumer watchdog in place who is letting consumers know what fair practices are, making sure that transactions are transparent, and making sure that banks have to compete for customers based on the quality of their service and good prices.Now, the frustrating thing that we have right now is that you've got folks over in Congress, Republicans, who have said that they see their role as eliminating any prohibitions on any practices for financial companies. And I think that's part of the frustration that the American people feel, because they've just gone through a period in which they were seeing a bunch of hidden fees, rate hikes that they didn't know about, fine print that they could not understand. That's true for credit cards. That's true for mortgages. It contributed to overall weakness in the economy.And yes, I think it is entirely appropriate for the Government to have some oversight role to make sure that consumers are protected. So banks--and any business in America--can price their products any way they want. That's how the free market works. As long as there's transparency and accountability and consumers understand what they're getting.

They expect me to fulfill my role as President and allow Senators to perform their duties.

Do you stand by your claim that foreign influence is largely to blame, and will you definitively step down after next year's elections? [SEP] Let's not forget why we went to Afghanistan in the first place. A terrorist organization, operating freely under the then-Afghan government, brutally murdered 3,000 Americans. It was our duty to dismantle that organization and prevent future attacks. Our brave service members, along with Afghan allies, largely achieved that primary objective. We aimed to cripple Al Qaeda, and we've come damn close. Everything we've done in the last decade has been geared towards that goal. When this conflict ends, we'll be able to say that the sacrifices made by our troops secured that objective. Now, we also understood early on that a stable, sovereign Afghanistan, a responsible international partner, was in our national interest. That required Afghanistan to build its own security capacity and strive for peace and prosperity. Afghanistan still has work to do, but the possibility of a peaceful and prosperous future is greater now than before we intervened. Did we achieve every pie-in-the-sky dream? Probably not. But did we achieve our core objective and forge a strong relationship with an Afghan government willing to prevent future attacks against the U.S.? Absolutely. We're on our way.

As for the corruption question, yes, there is corruption in Afghanistan, including within the Afghan government. We are fighting it. Have we succeeded entirely? No. Regarding foreign-sourced corruption, I've been clear: less corruption will only happen with cooperation between us and our international partners on correcting some of the methods or applications of delivery of assistance to Afghanistan, without cooperation and without recognition of the problems.

Mr. President, I was talking with a journalist about an hour ago in Baghdad who says, to be a cynic in Iraq is to be naive at this point; that there is discernible progress, undeniable progress on the battlefield, but there is just as discernable and undeniable lack of progress on political reconciliation. Given the premise of the surge is to give the Iraqi Government breathing space to get its business done, given that they're not getting their business done, are the American people entitled to hear from you more than, I've told Prime Minister Maliki he's got to do better? [SEP] As you know, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be coming back to report on the findings of the success of the surge. The surge success will not only include military successes and military failures but also political successes and political failures. And my own perspective is, is that they have made some progress but not enough. I fully recognize this is a difficult assignment. One of the things that—it's difficult because of years of tyrannical rule that have created a lot of suspicions. And there's a lot of—these folks need to trust each other more.Secondly, from my perspective, we're watching leaders learn how to be leaders. This is a new process for people to be democratic leaders. Now, no question, they haven't passed some of the law we expected them to pass up to now. That's where a lot of people will focus their attention. On the other hand, there is a Presidency Council, with people from different political parties, trying to work through some of these difficult issues, trying to work through the distrust that has caused them not to be able to pass some of the law we expect.And the July 15th report that I submitted to Congress, there were indications that they had met about half the benchmarks and some of the political benchmarks they were falling short. One of the things I found interesting is that the assembly, their elected parliament, has passed about 60 pieces of legislation this year, some of which are directly relevant to reconciliations, like judicial reform, some of which were unwinding Saddam's laws in the past.One of the questions I recently asked about, is there a functioning government? Is there—a lot of Americans look at it and say, There's nothing happening there. There's, like, no government at all, I expect they're saying. So I asked about the budgeting process. In other words, is there a centralized budgeting system that takes the oil revenues? As I understand, about 97 percent of the Iraqi revenues to date come from oil. And do they have a rational way of spending that money for the good of society? Now, most of the money, it turns out, is going into their military operations, operating expenses, and capital expenses.But one of the things I found interesting in my questions was there is revenue sharing. In other words, a central Government revenue sharing to Provincial governments. It surprised me, frankly, because the impression you get from people who are reporting out of Iraq is that it's, like, totally dysfunctional. That's what your—I guess your kind of—your friend or whoever you talked to is implying.In 2006, the central Government allocated $2.3 billion to the Provinces. You know, I'm not exactly sure how the funding formula worked, but a quick analysis: There is no question that Shi'a and Sunni Provinces and Kurdish Provinces were receiving money. Of the 2.3 billion, 1.9 had been obligated or spent. Now, some of that money is being better spent now because of bottom-up reconciliation that's taken place in places like Anbar, particularly with the help of our Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The PRTs are helping. That's not to say what—my point to you there is that there needs still to be work in making sure that the Provincial governments are functioning well, to earn the trust of the people. It's not just the central Government that we're working with; we're also working with Provincial governments to make sure that people have—are inspired to believe that the state is in their interest.The point I'm making to you on this, Jim [Jim Axelrod, CBS News], is that there is a lot of work left to be done; don't get me wrong. If one were to look hard, they could find indications that—more than indications, facts that show the Government is learning how to function. People say we need an oil revenue sharing law. I agree with that; that needs to be codified. However, there is oil revenue sharing taking place, is my point. There's a lot of work to be done, and the fundamental question facing America is, is it worth it? Does it matter whether or not we stay long enough for a ally in this war against radicals and extremists to emerge? And my answer is, it does matter. Long-term consequences will face our country if we leave before the job is done.

I was bummed when the bill hit a snag. Frankly, it's weird they're focusing on my AG when it won't change a thing. But I think we can get immigration done. It'll take Dems stepping up, and me working with the Republicans who want a deal. I even called some Senators to figure out how to get back on track, even working with Kennedy.

Absolutely. And yes, we can manage both. The elections in Pakistan were a victory for its people – fair elections where their voices were heard. That's a win for the war on terror because those ideologues we're fighting despise free societies. Musharraf kept his word, holding elections and ending emergency law. Now, it's up to the new government to be friends with the U.S. We see Pakistan as a key ally with shared interests, like stopping radicals and preventing attacks on both our nations. As for American and African interests aligning, of course. The U.S. is a melting pot, and African Americans are a significant part of our nation. They should support helping Africa. We're in a global village now. Problems spread easily. If the U.S. isolates itself, it's ignoring reality. Migration is unstoppable. If we don't help Africa's youth, they'll seek opportunities elsewhere, potentially bringing challenges to our shores. Supporting Africa is enlightened self-interest.

Considering China's reaction, including seizing a drone, shouldn't we be more cautious? Do you think this warrants a complete overhaul of our China strategy, and what's your take on these direct calls with Taiwan? [SEP] Look, it's a valid question. I'm in the middle on this one. I think we should always be looking at our foreign policy with fresh eyes. I'm proud of what I've done, but you get stuck in a bubble after eight years. New perspectives are good for democracy. A new President should examine everything. I did that when I came in. The US-China relationship is hugely important. It affects the world economy, our national security, our presence in Asia. If that relationship goes south, everyone suffers. So, taking a look is fine. I told the President-elect to be systematic about foreign policy. Get your team in place, get them briefed, and then make decisions. That way, everyone's on the same page. As for Taiwan, there's a long-standing agreement to keep things as they are. Taiwan's different from mainland China, but China sees it as part of China. The Taiwanese get some autonomy. This keeps the peace. But for China, Taiwan is a big deal. It's central to their identity.

{"sentence": "Q. Yes, sir. Mr. President, can you explain the anger and even outrage many Democrats felt when the tax cut bill extended tax cuts not just for the middle class, but also for the wealthy? And is that a divide that you may be contributing to when you and the Vice President talk about morally inappropriate tax cuts for the wealthy? [SEP] Look, the frustration that people felt about that was frustration I share. I've said that before, and I'll probably say it again. I don't think that over the long run we can afford a series of tax breaks for people who are doing very well and don't need it; were doing well when Bill Clinton was in office. They were still rich then, and they will still be rich if those tax cuts went away.And so this is going to be a debate that we're going to be having over the next couple of years. Because I guarantee you, as soon as the new Congress is sworn in, we're going to have to have a conversation about how do we start balancing our budget, or at least getting to a point that's sustainable when it comes to our deficit and our debt.And that's going to require us cutting programs that don't work, but it also requires us to be honest about paying for the things that we think are important. If we think it's important to make sure that our veterans are getting care that they need when they come back home from fighting in Afghanistan or Iraq, we can't just salute and wish them well and have a Veterans Day parade. We got to make sure that there are doctors and nurses and facilities for posttraumatic stress disorder, and that costs money.If we say that education is going to be the single most important determinant for our children's success and this country's success in the 21st century, we can't have schools that are laying off so many teachers that they start going to 4 days a week, as they've done in Hawaii, for example.We've got to make sure that young people can afford to go to college. If we want to keep our competitive edge in innovation, well, we've got to invest in basic research; the same basic research that resulted in the Internet, the same basic research that invited--that resulted in GPS. All those things originated in research funded by the Government.So we are going to have to compare the option of maintaining the tax cuts for the wealthy permanently versus spending on these things that we think are important. And that's a debate that I welcome. But I completely understand why not just Democrats but some Republicans might think that that part of the tax package we could have done without.Having said that, I want to repeat: Compromise, by definition, means taking some things you don't like. And the overall package was the right one to ensure that this economy has the best possible chance to grow and create jobs. And there is no better antipoverty program than an economy that's growing. There is no better deficit-reduction program than an economy that is growing. And if the economy started contracting, as it might have had we not gotten this tax agreement, then the choices that we would have to make would be even tougher.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, reflecting on the strides made in LGBT rights during your tenure – hate crimes protection, the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' nationwide marriage equality, and greater acceptance of transgender individuals – how significant do you consider LGBT rights to be in your overall legacy? And how optimistic are you that this progress will continue or at least be maintained under the next administration? [SEP] I couldn't be prouder of the transformation our society has undergone in the past decade. While I believe we played a helpful role, the real heroes are the activists, the sons and daughters, and the couples who courageously said, 'This is who I am, and I'm proud.' Their bravery opened hearts and minds, and eventually, the laws caught up. But none of this would have been possible without their activism, whether loud and visible or quiet and personal. Our administration's role was to help society move forward in a way that minimized backlash and respected the fact that these issues were often controversial. Take, for example, our approach to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' By being methodical, working with the Joint Chiefs, and demonstrating that it wouldn't impact the effectiveness of our military, we were able to achieve meaningful change. I am proud of the work of Secretary Gates, Chairman Mullen, and the Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately did the right thing. But again, this wouldn't have happened without the incredible transformation happening in society. When I awarded Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant every word. Her kindness and likability, projected into living rooms across the country, changed attitudes. That wasn't easy for her, and it's just one example of what was happening in communities nationwide. I'm proud that we were able to provide some support to help the movement advance. I believe this progress is irreversible because American society has changed, especially the attitudes of young people.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. With the flu outbreak spreading and worsening, can you talk about whether you think it's time to close the border with Mexico, and whether--under what conditions you might consider quarantining, when that might be appropriate? [SEP] Well, first of all, as I said, this is a cause for deep concern but not panic. And I think that we have to make sure that we recognize that how we respond--intelligently, systematically, based on science and what public health officials have to say--will determine in large part what happens.I've consulted with our public health officials extensively on a day-to-day basis, in some cases, an hour-to-hour basis. At this point, they have not recommended a border closing. From their perspective it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out, because we already have cases here in the United States. We have ramped up screening efforts as well as made sure that additional supplies are there on the border so that we can prepare in the eventuality that we have to do more than we're doing currently.But the most important thing right now that public health officials have indicated is that we treat this the same way that we would treat other flu outbreaks, just understanding that because this is a new strain we don't yet know how it will respond. So we have to take additional precautions, essentially, take out some additional insurance. Now, that's why I asked for an additional $1.5 billion, so that we can make sure that everything is in place should a worst-case scenario play out.I do want to compliment Democrats and Republicans who worked diligently back in 2005 when the bird flu came up. I was part of a group of legislators who worked with the Bush administration to make sure that we had beefed up our infrastructure and our stockpiles of antiviral drugs like Tamiflu. And I think the Bush administration did a good job of creating the infrastructure so that we can respond. For example, we've got 50 million courses of antiviral drugs in the event that they're needed.So the Government is going to be doing everything that we can. We're coordinating closely with State and local officials. Secretary Napolitano at Department of Homeland Security, newly installed Secretary Sebelius of Health and Human Services, our Acting CDC Director, they are all on the phone on a daily basis with all public health officials across the States to coordinate and make sure that there's timely reporting, that if as new cases come up that we are able to track them effectively, that we're allocating resources so that they're in place.The key now, I think, is to make sure that we are maintaining great vigilance, that everybody responds appropriately when cases do come up, and individual families start taking very sensible precautions that can make a huge difference. So wash your hands when you shake hands. Cover your mouth when you cough. I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference. If you are sick, stay home. If your child is sick, keep them out of school. If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane. Don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus.So those are the steps that I think we need to take right now. But understand that because this is a new strain, we have to be cautious. If this was a strain that we were familiar with, then we might have to--then I think we wouldn't see the kind of alert levels that we're seeing, for example, with the World Health Organization.

We're actively consulting with our friends around the world to figure out how we can collectively address this matter. We believe we can compensate for a significant portion of any losses. However, let's not lose sight of the fact that Russia also needs to sell that gas and oil. It's a major source of their revenue. If that revenue stream is cut off, they'll be significantly impacted as well. This isn't just a one-way street. We're working tirelessly to help Europe mitigate any immediate gas supply disruptions if they happen. We're coordinating closely with our European partners, including Germany, to ensure a unified approach. We are ready for all kinds of situation.

[SEP] Well, I reckon folks are more worried 'bout Congress not passin' the jobs bill, even though most Americans, even some Republicans, think it's a good idea. That's why folks ain't too happy with Congress right now. Usually, if most people don't like what you're doin', you change things up. But Congress ain't doin' that, especially the Republicans.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence will send a message that leaking classified material will not generate a tough sentence to groups like WikiLeaks? How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here? [SEP] Well, first of all, let's be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.It has been my view that given she went to trial, that due process was carried out, that she took responsibility for her crime, that the sentence that she received was very disproportional—disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received, and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made it sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.And I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of Government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that had been put in place.I recognize that there's some folks who think they're not enough, and I think all of us, when we're working in big institutions, may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we're often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk or the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or Embassies to function effectively. And that has to be kept in mind.So with respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. First of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC e-mails that were leaked. I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance. And I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.What I can say broadly is that, in this new cyber age, we're going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us, whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes or trying to commit acts of terrorism or folks who want to interfere with our elections.And we're going to have to continually build the kind of architecture that makes sure our—the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we're doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their Government is doing on their behalf.But with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have for the other commutations and pardons that I've done, and I felt that in light of all the circumstances that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.Margaret Brennan [CBS News].", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. So will you take action—on the border supplemental, can you act alone? [SEP] Well, I'm going to have to act alone because we don't have enough resources. We've already been very clear: We've run out of money. And we are going to have to reallocate resources in order to just make sure that some of the basic functions that have to take place down there, whether it's making sure that these children are properly housed or making sure we've got enough immigration judges to process their cases, that those things get done. We're going to have to reallocate some resources.But the broader point, Wendell, is that if in fact House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress—despite the fact that I've taken fewer executive actions than my Republican predecessor or my Democratic predecessor before that or the Republican predecessor before that—then the easiest way to solve it is passing legislation. Get things done.On the supplemental, we agreed on 80 percent of the issues. There were 20 percent of the issues that perhaps there were disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. As I said to one Republican colleague who was down here that I was briefing about some national security issues, why wouldn't we just go ahead and pass the 80 percent that we agree on and we'll try to work to resolve the differences on the other 20 percent? Why wouldn't we do that? And he didn't really have a good answer for it.So there's no doubt that I can always do better on everything, including making additional calls to Speaker Boehner and having more conversations with some of the House Republican leadership. But in the end, the challenge I have right now is that they are not able to act even on what they say their priorities are, and they're not able to work and compromise even with Senate Republicans on certain issues. And they are—they consider what have been traditionally Republican-supported initiatives, they consider those as somehow a betrayal of the cause.Take the example of the Export-Import Bank. This is an interesting thing that's happened. I mean, this is a program in which we help to provide financing to sell American goods and products around the world. Every country does this. It's traditionally been championed by Republicans. For some reason, right now the House Republicans have decided that we shouldn't do this, which means that when American companies go overseas and they're trying to close a sale on selling Boeing planes, for example, or a GE turbine or some other American product that has all kinds of subcontractors behind it and is creating all kinds of jobs and all sorts of small businesses depend on that sale, and that American company is going up against a German company or a Chinese company, and the Chinese and the American—German company are providing financing and the American company isn't, we may lose that sale.Why—when did that become something that Republicans opposed? It would be like me having a car dealership for Ford, and the Toyota dealership offers somebody financing, and I don't. We will lose business and we'll lose jobs if we don't pass it.So there are some big issues where I understand why we have differences. All right? On taxes, Republicans want to maintain some corporate loopholes I think need to be closed because I think that we should be giving tax breaks to families that are struggling with childcare or trying to save for a college education. On health care, obviously, their view is, is that we should not be helping folks get health care, even though it's through the private marketplace. My view is, is that in a country as wealthy as ours, we can afford to make sure that everybody has access to affordable care.Those are legitimate policy arguments. But getting our Ambassadors confirmed? These are career diplomats, not political types. Making sure that we pass legislation to strengthen our borders and put more folks down there? Those shouldn't be controversial. And I think you'd be hard-pressed to find an example of where I wouldn't welcome some reasonable efforts to actually get a bill passed out of Congress that I could sign.Last question, Michelle Kosinski [CNN].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, in light of the supercommittee's potential deadlock and the looming sequester, and considering Republican efforts to alter the automatic cuts, are you prepared to veto any such bill? Additionally, could you clarify the substance of your 'hot mic' conversation with President Sarkozy concerning Prime Minister Netanyahu? [SEP] Let's address the supercommittee first. Back in August, we reached an agreement to cut a trillion dollars over the next decade, largely from discretionary spending. We also recognized the need for an additional 1.2 trillion to put us on a more stable fiscal path. The sequester was designed to compel both sides to move beyond their entrenched positions and act in the best interests of the nation. Since then, there have been numerous discussions, but it appears that people are still clinging to their rigid stances rather than seeking solutions. I've presented a comprehensive plan that would achieve over $3 trillion in savings, a balanced approach that the American people favor. It entails putting everything on the table: discretionary spending cuts, non-defense and defense cuts, adjustments to entitlement programs, healthcare cost reductions, and additional revenue. When it comes to revenue, it makes sense to begin by asking the wealthiest among us to contribute a bit more before asking seniors to pay more for their Medicare. This is the same proposal I shared with Speaker Boehner in August, a balanced approach that every independent committee has supported. It seems people are constantly trying to manipulate the numbers to achieve a different outcome. However, the equation remains the same: a balanced approach is crucial to avoid crippling Medicare and Medicaid. I hope the congressional leadership on the supercommittee will rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change. I'm ready to sign legislation that is balanced and resolves the problem. Regarding the 'hot mic' incident in France, I won't comment on private conversations with other leaders. However, my primary discussion with President Sarkozy centered on my disappointment with France's vote in favor of Palestinian membership in UNESCO, which would require the US to cut funding, undermining direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis.

I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.And then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they'll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]I wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it's only—is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated—children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated? [SEP] That's all? [] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in—on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.With regard to am I confident?—I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms—[]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.I don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten—we've each committed—I trust the members of—the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.With regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience—but reconciliation—that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.Today—I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get—if you're making less than $150,000—you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get—in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth—12 months divided—$3,600—$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty—child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who—what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.Thank you. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours—needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic—we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible—which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We're going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance, I agree. And—but we're overcoming. We're putting our all into that and also together in overcoming that imbalance.I'm sorry.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In 2010, you called the result of the midterm election a shellacking. What do you call this? And can you give us an update on your feelings about the immigration Executive order in the result—in the aftermath of this election? Does the election affect your plans to release it? Will it still—is it likely to come out before the lame duck session is over? And have you reduced its scope to just a couple million people? [SEP] Well, as I said in my opening statement, there's no doubt that Republicans had a good night. And what we're going to make sure that we do is to reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, who are now running both Chambers in Congress, and find out what their agenda is. And my hope is, is that they've got some specific things they want to do that correspond with some things that we want to get done. What's most important to the American people right now, the resounding message not just of this election, but basically, the last several is: Get stuff done. Don't worry about the next election. Don't worry about party affiliation. Do worry about our concerns. Worry about the fact that I'm a single mom and, at the end of the month, it's really hard for me to pay the bills, in part because I've got these huge childcare costs. Do worry about the fact that I'm a young person who's qualified to go to college, but I'm really worried about taking $50,000 a year out in debt, and I don't know how I'd pay that back. Do worry about the fact that I'm a construction worker who has been working all my life, and I know that there's construction work that should be done, but right now, for some reason, projects are stalled. If we're thinking about those folks, I think we're, hopefully, going to be able to get some stuff done.In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would strengthen our borders; would streamline our legal immigration system so that it works better and we're attracting the best and the brightest from around the world; and that we give an opportunity for folks who've lived here, in many cases, for a very long time, may have kids who are U.S. citizens, but aren't properly documented—give them a chance to pay their back taxes, get in the back of the line, but get through a process that allows them to get legal.The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed a good bill. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system, but our economy, and would improve business conditions here in the United States and make sure that American-born workers aren't undercut by workers who are undocumented and aren't always paid a fair wage, and as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing.So we got a bipartisan bill out of the Senate. I asked John Boehner at that point, can we pass this through the House? There's a majority of votes in the House to get this passed. And Speaker Boehner, I think, was sincere about wanting to pass it, but had difficulty over the last year trying to get it done.So when he finally told me he wasn't going to call it up this year, what I indicated to him is, I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away.That's a commitment I made not just to the American people and to businesses and the evangelical community and law enforcement folks and everybody who's looked at this issue and thinks that we need immigration reform; that's a commitment that I also made to John Boehner, that I would act in the absence of action by Congress.So before the end of the year, we're going to take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve the functioning of our immigration system that will allow us to surge additional resources to the border, where I think the vast majority of Americans have the deepest concern. And at the same time, I'll be reaching out to both Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and other Republican as well as Democratic leaders to find out how it is that they want to proceed. And if they want to get a bill done, whether it's during the lame duck or next year, I'm eager to see what they have to offer.But what I'm not going to do is just wait. I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I'm going to keep on doing so. But in the meantime, let's figure out what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, with the Seattle City Council voting to defund their police department and Police Chief Carmen Best resigning, what does this signify about the current state of our nation and the 'defund the police' movement? [SEP] Seattle, after all they've been through, with the embarrassment of Antifa and other radical left groups taking over a large part of the city—a major city—that they allowed that to happen is unbelievable. That it took so long to fix is unbelievable. And they only acted because they knew we were going in the next day, and they didn't want to be embarrassed. The people just gave up, they were exhausted from having their city taken over for so long. The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount from the police department, really, to the point where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job. So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are. They've done a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly.

The notion that leaking classified information goes unpunished is simply false. Her sentence was commuted because it was disproportionate. As for WikiLeaks, the intelligence community's findings were inconclusive regarding their knowledge of Russian hacking. I don't concern myself with Mr. Assange's pronouncements.

[SEP] I will let the Prime Minister talk about his relations with Al Sadr. I will tell you that he and I spent a lot of time talking about the security situation inside of Iraq. I expressed my concern about the security situation; he expressed his concern about the security situation. After all, one of his most important jobs is to provide security for the Iraqi people. Part of the Prime Minister's frustration is, is that he doesn't have the tools necessary to take care of those who break the law.I was reassured by his commitment to a pluralistic society that is politically united, and a society in which people are held to account if they break the law, whether those people be criminals, Al Qaida, militia, whoever.He discussed with me his political situation, and I think it is best that he talk to you about the Sadr group or any other group he wants to talk about inside of Iraq. Matter of fact, my coalition is not with only one entity. The national unity Government is a government formed of all the entities that participated in it. Therefore, that coalition basically represent a national responsibility.And Mr. Sadr and the Sadrists are just one component that participate in the Parliament or in the Government. And I think participating in the Government is a responsibility, and it's a mutual commitment, and those who participate in this Government need to bear responsibilities. And foremost upon those responsibilities is the protection of this Government, the protection of the Constitution, the protection of the law, not breaking the law.Therefore, I do not talk about one side at the expense of the other. I'm talking about a state; I'm talking about law; I'm talking about commitments. And this should apply to all the partners in the Government who have chosen to participate in the political process.As to the issues that would pertain to violating the law or breaking the law, we would deal with them the same way, because the most important principle is the sovereignty and the power and the establishment of the state that must be borne by the state, but only our partners should participate in that.", "label": "General"}

He was executing the policy that I had laid out; that he was executing the orders that I had issued and that were reflective of the review process that took place last year. Okay? I'll try to be even briefer than my colleague, Mr. President. You know, I hope that we have quite friendly relations with President Obama, but I try not to give pieces of advice that cannot be fulfilled. This is a hard topic, a difficult one. I can say only two things. First of all, we believe that, at present, the United States and some other countries are assisting the Afghan people in obtaining the much wanted statehood and restore the basis of the functioning of an effective state, restore their civil society and their economy. And in these terms, we will support and back the efforts of the U.S.As far as our own experience, well-known experiences--[inaudible]--I would very much like to see the Afghan people in near future having an effective state and a modern economy, which requires toiling more than a year. But this is the path to guarantee that the most--the gravest scenarios of the last time will not repeat.Please, ITAR-TASS.", "label": "Implicit"}

The key is seeing who represents Russia at events like the G-8. That'll hint at Russia's foreign policy after Putin. But I can't give you a solid answer right now. What I can tell you is that keeping relations with Russia is crucial. We need their help on things like proliferation and Iran. Remember when Putin offered to give enriched uranium to Iran's Bushehr plant, so they wouldn't need to enrich it themselves? That was a good thing. We need to be able to work with Russia on Iran. There are lots of areas where we need to cooperate. Like missile defense in Europe, which I talked about with the Czech Prime Minister. We need to make the Russians understand that the system isn't aimed at them, but at real threats like rogue states with weapons of mass destruction. So, I'm going to try to make sure my successor can have a relationship with whoever's running foreign policy in Russia. It's in our country's interest. Doesn't mean we'll always agree.

I won't get into it. I'm going to let him sell his ideas. But a lot of people don't disagree with his ideas. But it's a very hard thing to do if you're a great citizen of France. You love your country, but you want to do the way you've been doing it for a long time. But maybe that's not working. And maybe they have to do what he has to do. I think he's going to do a fantastic job. But it's very tough for him. I know how tough it is for him. He's been having a hard time. And nobody would have any easy time. But I do believe he is doing the right thing. Boris is different. It's a different kind of a deal. Boris has to try and do something with Brexit. It's very tough. I deal with the EU. The EU is--that's a very, very strong group of people. They have their ideas, and they're not easy to deal with, I will tell you. We've very close to making a deal, by the way, with the EU. I have to say this. We made a great deal with Japan. And we're very close to maybe making a deal with the EU. Because they don't want tariffs; it's very simple. They don't want to tax cars. Mercedes Benz, BMW, they don't need a 20-percent or a 25-percent tax. But we're very close. I think we're going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route. I may have to go that route, but maybe not. We're going to have a deal, a really fair deal. But the EU is another one. We've been losing $180 billion a year for many years. That's a lot of money.

[SEP] The key to our success is jobs, period. If we can get people back to work, they'll have the confidence to spend, businesses will invest, and the economy will grow. We also need to fix the credit markets so businesses can get the loans they need. And finally, we need to stabilize the housing market, working with the Fed and the FDIC to prevent foreclosures and support housing values.

[SEP] Not sure about that Cameron quote, but let's talk about Afghanistan. We've been there for nine years, almost a decade. It's our longest war. We all want a stable Afghanistan, able to handle its own security and not a place for terrorists to attack us. We'll need to help them for a long time, building their government, courts, police, and a fair system. But that's not the same as having troops there. We announced a plan last November to send more troops to give the Afghan government room to build its forces, push back the Taliban, and improve things. General Petraeus is doing that, and our allies and President Karzai are on board. It's tough, given Afghanistan's problems. We hope to see progress by the end of the year. We'll check on things and make changes as needed. Like in Iraq, we need a political solution. As for the talks, it's too soon to say. We need to be careful but open. The Taliban is a mixed bag.

And I have lunches with CEOs and IT venture capitalists and labor leaders and pretty much folks from all walks of life on a whole bunch of topics. And if you looked at my schedule on any given day, we're interacting with a whole lot of people.And I think it's fair to say that we have a pretty good track record of working with folks on technology and IT from our campaign where, both in 2008 and 2012, we did a pretty darn good job on that. So it's not—the idea that somehow we didn't have access or were interested in people's ideas, I think isn't accurate. What is true is that, as I said before, our IT systems, how we purchase technology in the Federal Government is cumbersome, complicated, and outdated.And so this isn't a situation where—on my campaign, I could simply say, who are the best folks out there? Let's get them around a table. Let's figure out what we're doing, and we're just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals. If you're doing it at the Federal Government level, you're going through 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other, and there are all kinds of laws involved, and it makes it more difficult. It's part of the reason why, chronically, Federal IT programs are over budget, behind schedule.And one of the—when I do some Monday morning quarterbacking on myself, one of the things that I do recognize is—since I know that the Federal Government has not been good at this stuff in the past—2 years ago, as we were thinking about this, we might have done more to make sure that we were breaking the mold on how we were going to be setting this up.

I really don't. A lot of people don't understand this. I ran one election, and I won. It happened to be for President. I don't care politically. I'm going to run another election. I think I'm winning based on polls that we see. Whether I win or not, I have to do the right thing.So I don't do things for political reasons. Is it good? Probably not. Maybe it is.

That's what you got to know; we're going to succeed.My comments yesterday reflected the fact that we're not succeeding nearly as fast as I wanted when I said it at the time and that conditions are tough in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad.

I also want our troops to understand that we support them, that I believe that tough mission I've asked them to do is going to be accomplished, and that they're doing good work and necessary work.I want the Iraqis to understand that we believe that if they stand up—step up and lead—and with our help, we can accomplish the objective. And I want the enemy to understand that this is a tough task, but they can't run us out of the Middle East, that they can't intimidate America. They think they can.

The President highlighted various trade-related issues, focusing on the perceived unfairness of quotas on items like beef and lamb. I assured him that I would seriously consider his requests.

Uruguay produces truly exceptional blueberries, and the fundamental question is whether those blueberry growers will have the opportunity to sell their products in the United States. So, we discussed a wide array of agricultural products. I emphasized to the President that problems can only be resolved if they are brought to the table. Where we can offer assistance, we will; where we cannot, I will provide a clear explanation. You raised the issue of protectionist tendencies, which I find concerning both within our own country and on a global scale. I firmly believe that free and fair trade promotes poverty reduction. Therefore, I am a strong advocate for completing the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with President Lula, who expressed keen interest in our conversations. I did not disclose any confidential information, but I discussed how we can move the Doha round forward.

[SEP] On North Korea, our shared objective, along with the global community, is denuclearization and their integration as a responsible member. This promotes peace in the region and supports North Korea's progress. To encourage this, we must collaborate. China's influence is considerable, making their involvement essential. We addressed this. China and Russia, with the international community, share the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are working together. China has been active in adopting and enforcing U.N. resolutions on North Korea's missile launches and nuclear tests. Russia also supports denuclearization and has backed U.N. resolutions. They helped include a strong message to North Korea in the G-8 Foreign Ministers' statement. These efforts are crucial to conveying a unified message that their nuclear weapons are unacceptable and urging them to make the right decision. I don't know Kim Jong Un personally and can't judge his character. But his actions have been provocative and futile. We'll maintain a strong deterrent and not reward provocation. However, we're open to North Korea pursuing denuclearization, honoring commitments, rejoining the international community, and achieving security and prosperity. If North Korea's current path hasn't led to a strong, prosperous nation, Kim Jong Un should change course. If he does, we and the world would welcome it.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, critics argue your policies disproportionately favor the wealthy. How do you respond to accusations that your administration is enacting a form of plutocracy?

But let's be real, elections have consequences, and the people spoke. Now, I'm not telling anyone to shut up, but I am saying that voting matters, getting involved matters, knowing your stuff matters. And to all those young folks out there, don't take our system for granted. It's not a given. It's hard work. If half the country doesn't even bother to vote, then democracy's in trouble. If we can't tell the difference between facts and fake news, we're in deep trouble. And if everyone's just screaming at each other and refusing to budge, then the whole thing falls apart. So, my advice? Understand how democracy works, and be a citizen, not just when you're mad about something. It's a constant job. And yeah, there's always room for improvement. We've made mistakes, no doubt about it. But this country's been a force for good, a beacon of freedom. Don't forget that. Don't let the noise drown out the truth.

I'll review the House proposal with an open mind, assessing whether it meets these same criteria.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, what is the strategy for overcoming this global vaccine access gap? Will the US pledge additional vaccine shipments abroad? And realistically, with the current disparities, is ending the pandemic by 2022 still a viable objective? [SEP] It might require a slightly extended timeline on a global scale. The United States remains steadfast in its commitment. There exists a possibility, stretching from 2022 into 2023, that we could facilitate the provision of an additional billion doses. However, such arrangements are not yet finalized. Throughout this pandemic, I have endeavored to communicate what I know and what I believe can be accomplished. I am wary of making promises that I cannot fulfill. There was a clear consensus among our G-7 counterparts that this endeavor is ongoing; we will persist until we can adequately address the needs of the entire world. This is not only the morally correct course of action, but also the strategically prudent one, in terms of our own health and security. No wall can be erected high enough to prevent the ingress of novel viral strains. Consequently, this will be a sustained project, and the potential for future pandemics remains. We must establish a system capable of detecting, before it spirals out of control, a pandemic or a virus that may be on the horizon. Thus, for as long as there are nations in need of vaccination, we will continue to engage. Moreover, we have been actively involved in assisting, as I have made clear, and as most of my colleagues understood, as they knew from trying it themselves, this is a gargantuan logistical undertaking. It is one thing to dispatch X number of vaccines to nation Y; it is quite another to ensure that there are individuals capable of administering them. Accordingly, we are also providing the means for other countries to manufacture their own vaccines. We have all agreed on this. India possesses the capacity to do so, though they currently lack the requisite material resources. Much is underway to provide not only vaccines, but also the capacity for the countries in question to produce their own vaccines. Last question. Last question. The President. Just kidding.

{"sentence": "As you prepare for your final foreign trip, what assurances can you offer world leaders who have expressed concerns about your successor, Donald Trump, and the future of U.S. foreign policy? And, in light of the Democratic Party's recent defeat, what guidance can you provide regarding the party's future direction and leadership? [SEP] Well, one of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "President Bush, will the US intervene to bolster the dollar if verbal assurances fail? What's your reaction to Saudi Arabia's energy summit proposal? Prime Minister Jansa, how are rising energy costs and the strong euro impacting Eastern and Central Europe, potentially hindering growth? President Barroso, are EU food safety regulations overly restrictive, causing friction with the US? [SEP] Okay, John, interesting idea by the—His Majesty, the King of Saudi Arabia. Secondly, I articulated a policy that I had been articulating ever since I have been the President. It's the same policy, which is, we believe in a strong dollar and that relative value of economies will end up setting the proper valuation of the dollar. Past growth, or growth with little comparison in the his-tory—this is the growth of energy and food prices. And the food prices are going up due to high cost of energy or oil, and this has a significant effect on the economy in Slovenia and throughout Europe. This is one of the key questions being dealt with at the national level and at the level of the European institutions, as has been mentioned by President Barroso. This is a serious problem. It will, on the one hand, make us search long-term solutions. I have mentioned this in part before. And on the other hand, it will make us search short-term solutions, and one of these is energy efficiency.We have also discussed this at today's summit, and this is a strong message. The investment in research and development, the investment into what the economy can do, an economy that is less dependent on carbon, less dependent on fossil fuels, this will have a long-term strategic effect on the price.So the key is the technology. I remember the President of the United States saying 2 years ago at the summit meeting in Vienna that the key thing is investment in the development of new technologies. This is the key strategic reply to these challenge. And as far as the euro is concerned, on the one hand, we are satisfied and happy that euro is a strong currency. And since the 1st of January of last year, Slovenia is also part of the euro zone. And I can say that in the majority, the effects are positive. When calculating the high prices of oil in dollars, this slightly mitigates this jump. And on the other hand, this is also a problem for importers in the European Union.

Should the agreement be modified to address currency manipulation? Also, your comments on the killing of Mullah Mansur and Pakistan's concerns? Does this signal a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you concerned about a more extreme successor? [SEP] Regarding TPP, trade deals are always difficult. People always want a better deal, especially with multiple parties. And in an election year, some will play politics. But I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing for America and the world. This is a fast-growing region, a huge market for us. They sell to us with low tariffs, but our goods face higher tariffs. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods. TPP also requires higher labor and environmental standards. I haven't seen a good reason why TPP will hurt us. American workers and businesses benefit. The politics will be noisy, like with past trade deals. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too. As for currency manipulation, we have transparency provisions in TPP. Some want stronger measures, but it's hard to know why a currency is falling and if it's being manipulated. Binding other countries' monetary policy would mean binding our own Federal Reserve, which we won't do. But we've improved provisions to address competitive devaluations.

The situation is incredibly complex, with numerous factions, significant financial resources, and a surplus of weaponry. It's become entangled in both sectarian conflicts and geopolitical power plays. To achieve a resolution, the major powers with vested interests in Syria must acknowledge that a military victory is unattainable. Iran is undoubtedly a key player and must be included in these discussions. However, let me reiterate that we have not re-established normal diplomatic relations with Iran, nor do I foresee doing so in the near future. Therefore, I do not anticipate any formal agreements with Iran regarding our counter-ISIS campaign. Nevertheless, Iran wields considerable influence in Iraq, which has a predominantly Shia population. They maintain relationships with Iran, some of which are natural. We anticipate that Prime Minister Abadi will engage with and collaborate with Iran as a neighboring country. However, some relationships are less legitimate, such as Iran's financing of Shia militias that have previously killed American soldiers and may commit atrocities in Sunni regions. Our diplomats and military personnel on the ground are assessing where we can appropriately de-conflict and where we can collaborate with Prime Minister Abadi on an overarching strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty. We are also communicating to Abadi when Iran's actions are problematic and that we cannot cooperate in those areas unless those individuals are removed. These discussions are ongoing and will continue.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, a year ago you expressed optimism for bipartisan cooperation. Given the current political climate, how would you evaluate your own effectiveness in working with Democrats, and what specific legislative achievements demonstrate successful compromise? [SEP] Well, we're seeing some common ground on Iraq. Some in Congress disagree with our initial involvement, but Petraeus and Crocker's testimony seems to have made a difference. Funding for our troops is another area where we can hopefully find common ground. FISA is another example. Why change a good law? It works for the security of the country, which is what the American people want. It enables our intelligence experts to understand Al Qaida's intentions. The law needs to be enhanced by providing liability protection to phone companies that helped us. So, we found common ground there. Hopefully, we can find more as Congress moves forward with legislation. The reason I spoke out today is because there's a lot to be done. I'm not a legislator, but as head of the executive branch, I urge Congress to show progress and get results. It's hard to find common ground unless important bills are moving. They're not even moving. Not one appropriations bill has made it to my desk. How can you find common ground when there's no appropriations process? We found common ground on trade bills. Exports helped us overcome the weakness in the housing market last quarter. It makes sense to continue opening up markets to goods and services. Yet, there haven't been any bills moving when it comes to trade. Veterans Affairs is another area where we can find common ground. I asked Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead a commission to ensure our veterans get the benefits they deserve. I was concerned about bureaucratic delay and a system that didn't recognize the unique challenges of the current war. I'm concerned about PTSD and want people to focus on it. We sent up a bill, and I hope they move on it quickly. There's a place where we can find common ground.", "label": "General"}

And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect, just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.But I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of, you know, calls.

[SEP] Protesting is a fundamental expression of our democracy. I've been protested myself. I wouldn't tell people to be silent if they're concerned. However, I advise them to remember that elections, voting, organizing, and being informed matter. To young people, I say: don't take our systems for granted. Democracy is hard work. If a large percentage doesn't vote, democracy is weakened. If we can't discern between facts and propaganda, we have problems. If people are unwilling to compromise, democracy breaks down. Understand the foundations of a healthy democracy and engage continuously. There's complacency. Some forget the Cold War. Sometimes, there's an easy equivalence drawn between the U.S. and Russia, which is inaccurate. We have our flaws, but we've tried to apply principles of free speech and civil liberties.

How could we achieve the same in the area of security, in the context of the antimissile shield, our common—our cooperation in using common sites, and also in respect of the trade investment? [SEP] Do you want me to start on the missiles? The proposed missile shield is aimed at long-range missiles, missiles that would fly over Bulgaria. There are missile systems and defense systems available that would deal with intermediate-range missiles. And so just because Bulgaria is not a part of the longer range missile shield doesn't mean that there won't be equipment and help available for intermediate range. That's how I can answer that question.I know this creates some concerns around Europe, this missile shield, because of Russian objections. And so I had a meeting with President Putin in Germany at the G-8 and explained to him what I've been saying publicly, is, the missile shield would be developed to deal with a rogue regime that would try to hold a free nation hostage, or free nations hostage; that it's not aimed at Russia.I talked to Vladimir Putin a lot about our relations and made it clear that I simply do not view Russia as an enemy. I view Russia as a country with whom we should have and can have good relations to solve common problems.One such problem is Iran. Another problem is proliferation. There are areas we can work together, and he brought an interesting proposal. He said: I have an idea. Why don't we jointly use a radar in Azerbaijan to help deal with a potential threat? And I said: That's a good idea. I don't know how—whether it's technologically feasible; I'm not an expert. I've got experts in my Government, however, who could analyze your proposal, and I'd like for you to maybe—not maybe—I'd like for you to assign some experts in your Government to analyze my proposal.And that's where we left it in Germany. So we're going to have a group of people come together from the State Department, Defense Department, and the military to discuss how to deal with the true threats of the 21st century.And I would hope that would help explain some of the rhetoric that people in your country have seen coming out of the G-8, that there's a process where we can collaborate and share information in a very transparent way, which I think will be beneficial. And I would hope that the Russians would see the meetings as beneficial and out of the meetings realize our true intent, and hopefully, design systems that protect us all. I would like to begin by saying that we welcome the strategic dialog, and it was described as a strategic dialog by both leaders, both by President Bush and by Putin, a dialog which started within the framework of G-8. We Bulgarians would accept any solution that would provide more guarantees, more security guarantees, more guarantees of the indivisibility of the security of the Euro-Atlantic space, any solution that has been achieved, hammered out through dialog and in transparency, and any solution that is not directed against a third country, notably Russia in this case.I would take the liberty of paraphrasing something that was said in Prague—hopefully, my source was reliable; the President would correct me if I'm wrong or imprecise—the Bulgarians mustn't choose between their friendship with the United States and that with Russia. The Bulgarians should and can maintain friendly relations with both countries. Just as I am a friend with George and a friend with Vladimir, we could maintain, within the context of our Euro-Atlantic orientation, friendly relations with both without diluting the things, without losing sight of our strategic priorities. We should maintain relations with everyone who thinks likewise.This means the same approach would apply to the energy, the infrastructure sphere. This is why Bulgaria maintains— has maintained active relations with Russia on the major infrastructure, or rather energy projects.I myself, earlier today, offered to President Bush a clearer, firmer commitment by American companies to the energy project. Chevron, in respect of Bourgas-Alexandroupolis, or AMBO—I'm not going to list them all here—this is an investment in peace and the security of the region. This is a geostrategic contribution.

Also, could you clarify your 'hot mic' conversation with President Sarkozy concerning Prime Minister Netanyahu? [SEP] Let me address the supercommittee first. We agreed in August to a trillion dollars in cuts over the next decade, mainly from discretionary spending. We also recognized the need for an additional 1.2 trillion to stabilize our fiscal situation. The sequester was intended to push both sides to compromise. Unfortunately, it seems everyone's sticking to their entrenched positions. I've proposed a detailed plan achieving over $3 trillion in savings, a balanced approach favored by the American people. It includes discretionary spending cuts, non-defense and defense cuts, entitlement program adjustments, healthcare cost reductions, and additional revenue, starting with asking the wealthiest to contribute more before burdening seniors. This is the same proposal I presented to Speaker Boehner, echoing the recommendations of independent committees. People are trying to manipulate the math, but the equation remains the same: a balanced approach is necessary to avoid gutting essential programs. I hope the supercommittee will act responsibly. I won't comment on vetoing specific bills until I see them. As for the 'hot mic' incident, I won't discuss private conversations with leaders.

And do you perceive the agreements being pursued by the Pakistani government with certain militant tribes as a form of appeasement? Prime Minister, what are your expectations for the upcoming meeting in Saudi Arabia? And do you believe President Bush's presence in Jeddah would be beneficial? [SEP] Our paramount objective is to deny safe haven to extremists who seek to inflict harm upon innocent individuals. This is the guiding principle of Afghanistan's strategy, and it must also be the guiding principle of Pakistan's strategy. It is in our collective interest to prevent those who resort to murder to achieve political objectives from gaining sanctuary. To that end, we encourage enhanced dialogue between the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the past, a jirga, comprised of tribal leaders from both sides of the border, proved effective. Reviving this process would be a positive step. Furthermore, enhanced communication between the intelligence services of both countries is essential, as is improved cooperation, including trilateral border patrols involving Pakistan, Afghanistan, and coalition forces, to prevent the movement of individuals across the border. There is considerable common ground. To reiterate, it is in no one's interest for extremists to possess a safe haven from which to operate. The situation is undeniably delicate. Were I the president of a nation and individuals were crossing from another country to perpetrate violence against my citizens, I would be deeply concerned. We can assist in de-escalating the situation and developing a strategy to prevent extremists from establishing safe havens and enjoying freedom of movement. I shall be traveling to Jeddah next Sunday at the invitation of the King of Saudi Arabia to engage in a long-term dialogue, a process rather than a singular event, between oil producers and oil consumers. There is a growing consensus that the price of oil is increasingly influenced not only by current supply and demand dynamics but also by perceptions of future imbalances. I intend to convey to the King of Saudi Arabia and other participants that the world will expand its reliance on nuclear power, increase its utilization of renewable energy sources, augment its consumption of coal, and reduce its dependence on oil. The world is committed to enhancing the efficiency of oil utilization. This dialogue between producers and consumers is of paramount importance. President Bush recently visited Saudi Arabia. I have not been there recently. I wish to engage with the King and others to discuss what I believe should be an ongoing process of understanding the pressures on future demand and supply. This long-term debate can exert an influence on current markets. This is the essence of the discussion.

Whether that is delivering basic services the Government provides to the American people, whether that is our capacity to work with Congress so that they're passing legislation, whether it's how we communicate with the American people about what our priorities and vision is, we are constantly asking ourselves questions about how do we make sure that we're doing a better job.

There's going to be a consistent focus on how do we deliver more opportunity to more people in this country, how do we grow the economy faster, how do we put more people back to work.And I maybe have a naive confidence that if we continue to focus on the American people and not on our own ambitions or image or various concerns like that, that at the end of the day, when I look back, I'm going to be able to say the American people are better off than they were before I was President.

And separately, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party? [SEP] Good. One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably.

Can you, sir, talk about if--whether you talked about how you plan to proceed forward, and did you talk about this with President Obama?And of course, their continuing threat emanating from North Korea--a South Korean worker has been and is still detained by the North Koreans. What are your thoughts about the maintenance of the Kaesong industrial complex, and did you talk about--President Obama--or were there any concerns from the Americans about the Kaesong industrial complex? [SEP] has been resisting, and they've reacted aggressively to the new U.N. Security Council resolution, which is quite expected. And of course, the ns may react by firing another round of missiles or taking actions. We can also expect that from them as well. However, ns must understand that they will not be able to gain compensation by provoking a crisis. This has been a pattern in the past, but this will no longer be. The firm U.S.-Korea cooperation and alliance will not allow that. And the recent Security Council resolution is not simply about words; it is about taking follow-up action and vigorously implementing the U.N. Security Council resolution. And we'll make sure that we fully implement the U.N. Security Council resolution.Like I said, the ns must understand that their past behavior will not stand. And of course, not only the U.S.-Korea close partnership, but Japan, China, and the rest of the international community will take part in this effort. And now the ns will come to understand that this is different, that they will not be able to repeat the past or their past tactics and strategies. I urge the ns to fully give up their nuclear weapons programs and ambitions and to become a responsible member of the international community.With regards to the Kaesong industrial complex, the n authorities are demanding unacceptable demands, and we will not accept such demands being laid out by the ns. Of course, the South Korean Government is very much for maintaining the Kaesong industrial complex because the Kaesong industrial complex is a channel of dialog between the two Koreas. And also, another fact that we must not overlook is the fact that there are 40,000 n workers currently working in Kaesong industrial complex. If the Kaesong industrial complex were to close, these 40,000 n workers will lose their jobs.And therefore, I ask that--I urge the ns not to make any unacceptable demands, because we cannot really know what will happen if they continue on this path. And also the ns have been detaining a South Korean worker. They haven't been giving us any explanation, and also we know that there are two American journalists being currently held by the ns.

{"sentence": "Q. But it makes me wonder where you are, sir, at about the 2-year mark on Guantanamo, when closing it was one of your initial priorities, sir? [SEP] Obviously, we haven't gotten it closed. And let me just step back and explain that the reason for wanting to close Guantanamo was because my number-one priority is keeping the American people safe. One of the most powerful tools we have to keep the American people safe is not providing Al Qaida and jihadists recruiting tools for fledgling terrorists.And Guantanamo is probably the number-one recruitment tool that is used by these jihadist organizations. And we see it in the web sites that they put up. We see it in the messages that they're delivering.And so my belief is that we can keep the American people safe, go after those who would engage in terrorism. And my administration has been as aggressive in going after Al Qaida as any administration out there. And we've seen progress, as I noted during the Afghan review.Every intelligence report that we're seeing shows that Al Qaida is more hunkered down than they have been since the original invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, that they have reduced financing capacity, reduced operational capacity. It is much more difficult for their top folks to communicate, and a lot of those top folks can't communicate because they're underground now.But it is important for us, even as we're going aggressively after the bad guys, to make sure that we're also living up to our values and our ideals and our principles. And that's what closing Guantanamo is about, not because I think that the people who are running Guantanamo are doing a bad job, but rather because it's become a symbol. And I think we can do just as good of a job housing them somewhere else.Now, to the issue you had about the review. You're right, I won't comment right now on a review that I have not received yet. I can tell you that over the last 2 years, despite not having closed Guantanamo, we've been trying to put our battle against terrorists within a legal structure that is consistent with our history of rule of law. And we've succeeded on a number of fronts.One of the toughest problems is what to do with people that we know are dangerous, that we know are--have engaged in terrorist activity, are proclaimed enemies of the United States, but because of the manner in which they were originally captured, the circumstances right after 9/11 in which they are interrogated, it becomes difficult to try them, whether in a Article III court or in a military commission.Releasing them at this stage could potentially create greater danger for the American people. And so how do we manage that? And that's what this team has been looking at. Are there ways for us to make sure these folks have lawyers, to make sure that these folks have the opportunity to challenge their detention, but at the same time, making sure that we are not simply releasing folks who could do us grievous harm and have shown a capacity and willingness to engage in brutal attacks in the past?And so when I get that report, I'm sure that I'll have more comments on it. The bottom line is, is that striking this balance between our security and making sure that we are consistent with our values and our Constitution is not an easy task, but ultimately that's what's required for practical reasons.Because the more people are reminded of what makes America special--the fact that we stand for something beyond just our economic power or our military might, but we have these core ideals that we observe even when it's hard--that's one of our most powerful weapons. And I want to make sure that we don't lose that weapon in what is a serious struggle.So with that, everybody, I want to wish you all a merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy New Year.

[SEP] The last part—to the last question, yes. When we talked about whether or not we'd—the three meetings we talked about. And we talked about: We would go from there, if there was reason to, to go to a summit. We talked about a summit as being before the Ukraine item came up in terms of strategic doctrine and what the strategic relationship would be. So I still think that is a possibility, number one.Number two, I am very concerned. I'm very concerned that this could end up being—look, the only war that's worse than one that's intended is one that's unintended. And what I'm concerned about is, this could get out of hand—very easily get out of hand because of what you said: the borders of the—of Ukraine and what Russia may or may not do.I am hoping that Vladimir Putin understands that he is—short of a full-blown nuclear war, he's not in a very good position to dominate the world. And so I don't think he thinks that, but it is a concern. And that's why we have to be very careful about how we move forward and make it clear to him that there are prices to pay that could, in fact, cost his country an awful lot.But I—of course, you have to be concerned when you have, you know, a nuclear power invade—this has—if he invades—it hasn't happened since World War II.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Nine years after the September 11th attacks, why do you think it is that we are now seeing such an increase in suspicion and outright resentment of Islam, especially given that it has been one of your priorities to increase--to improve relations with the Muslim world? [SEP] I think that at a time when the country is anxious generally and going through a tough time, then fears can surface, suspicions, divisions can surface in a society. And so I think that plays a role in it.One of the things that I most admired about President Bush was after 9/11, him being crystal clear about the fact that we were not at war with Islam. We were at war with terrorists and murderers who had perverted Islam, had stolen its banner to carry out their outrageous acts. And I was so proud of the country rallying around that idea, that notion that we are not going to be divided by religion, we're not going to be divided by ethnicity. We are all Americans. We stand together against those who would try to do us harm.And that's what we've done over the last 9 years. And we should take great pride in that. And I think it is absolutely important now for the overwhelming majority of the American people to hang on to that thing that is best in us, a belief in religious tolerance, clarity about who our enemies are. Our enemies are Al Qaida and their allies who are trying to kill us, but have killed more Muslims than just about anybody on Earth. We have to make sure that we don't start turning on each other.And I will do everything that I can as long as I am President of the United States to remind the American people that we are one Nation under God, and we may call that God different names, but we remain one Nation. And as somebody who relies heavily on my Christian faith in my job, I understand the passions that religious faith can raise. But I'm also respectful that people of different faiths can practice their religion, even if they don't subscribe to the exact same notions that I do, and that they are still good people and they are my neighbors and they are my friends and they are fighting alongside us in our battles.And I want to make sure that this country retains that sense of purpose.

I would like to ask your opinion about what recently happened in Hong Kong, the recent attack on press freedom in Hong Kong. And Jimmy Lai was arrested; his newsroom was raided. What—how will the U.S. respond to this? [SEP] Well, I think it's a terrible thing. But one thing that we have done—you know, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives, and it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States with respect to that. It just won't be, because we've taken all of the incentives away.If you look at China—with the World Trade Organization, as an example—they're getting tremendous, because they're considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation, but we're not? And they get tremendous incentives.We have—by the way, I told them it's unacceptable, and we've been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.We've now withdrawn all of those incentives. It's going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States—and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it—will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We've withdrawn all of that.

That's not my estimation; if you look at the markets and you look at estimates in terms of capital flight, if you look at projections for Russian growth, what you're seeing is that the economy has ground to a halt. Somewhere between $100 and $200 billion of capital flight has taken place. You're not seeing a lot of investors coming in new to start businesses inside of Russia.And it has presented the choice to President Putin as to whether he is going to try to resolve the issues in eastern Ukraine through diplomacy and peaceful means, recognizing that Ukraine is a sovereign country and that it is up ultimately to the Ukrainian people to make decisions about their own lives; or alternatively, continue on the course that he's on, in which case, he's going to be hurting his economy and hurting his own people over the long term.And in that sense, we are doing exactly what we should be doing. And we're very pleased that our European allies and partners joined us in this process, as well as a number of countries around the world.Having said all that, the issue is not resolved yet. You still have fighting in eastern Ukraine. Civilians are still dying. We've already seen some of the consequences of this conflict in the loss of the Malaysian Airlines airline—or jetliner.And the sooner that we can get back on a track in which there are serious discussions taking place to assure that all Ukrainians are heard, that they can work through the political process, that they're represented, that the reforms that have already been offered by the Government in Kiev are implemented to protect Russian speakers, to assure decentralization of power—the sooner that we move on those, and the sooner that President Putin recognizes that Ukraine is an independent country, it's only at that point where we can say that the problem has truly been solved. But in the meantime, sanctions are working the way they're supposed to.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

{"sentence": "Q. You met Friday with Prime Minister Najib, who is facing allegations of corruption and human rights violations. And you'd said at your town hall event that you would raise those issues with him when you spoke privately. What was your message to Najib about the investments funds scandal and also about the issue of jailing his political opponents? [SEP] Okay. With respect to the refugee program, Paris just happened a week ago. News moves so fast these days that sometimes we just lose track. It's been so recent and so pervasive in the news, and people have, understandably, been so concerned given how similar Paris is to many American cities, that I get why legislation in the House moved forward quickly.My hope, though, is, is that now that we've got some time to catch our breath and take a look at this carefully, people understand that refugees who end up in the United States are the most vetted, scrutinized, thoroughly investigated individuals that ever arrive on American shores; that the process that's been constructed over the course of several administrations on a bipartisan basis is extraordinarily thorough and currently takes between 18 to 24 months for somebody to be approved.And so although, on its face, the House legislation simply says, well, we can just certify, and this isn't—not along the lines of some of the more radical proposals that we were hearing earlier in the week from some Presidential candidates—the fact of the matter is, is that if it gums up the works so much, then effectively, you don't end up seeing any refugees admitted. If you layer it with more and more bureaucracy that doesn't actually make us safer, because it doesn't do a better job of screening, but simply makes it almost impossible to process individuals who are coming in, then you're effectively ending the refugee program for people who desperately need it.And when I referred to a betrayal of our values, I was being very specific about some of the commentary that was made that would suggest, for example, that we might let Christians in but not Muslims; that we—somehow we're so fearful that a 4-year-old orphan might not be let in. And those of you who joined me to the refugee center yesterday and you saw those kids, that's who we're talking about. If you are a parent and you saw those kids, and you thought about what they had gone through, the notion that we couldn't find a home for them anywhere in the United States of America, it—that is contrary to our values.And the good news is, is that the overwhelming majority of the people who know that we are screening and all the precautions that are already taken, if they saw those kids, they'd say, yes, we need to do right by those children.So with respect to Prime Minister Najib, I don't comment on investigations happening back in the United States; I certainly am not going to comment on any investigations or legal proceedings that may be taking place in a foreign country where I'm a visitor. But I did raise with Prime Minister Najib—as I have with many of the leaders here in Southeast Asia, but also many leaders in Africa and Latin America and everywhere we go—the importance of transparency, accountability, the importance of rooting out corruption, all of which are impediments to development, all of which hold countries back, all of which contribute to poverty and stunted growth.And if countries solve those problems, even if they are resource poor and landlocked, they will do better. And if they don't solve those problems, it doesn't matter how much they're blessed by natural resources or size or geography, they're going to fail.And I also emphasized to Prime Minister Najib the importance of civil society and a free press in countries thriving. And every country here is at different levels and stages of development, both social and economic, and we don't expect that everybody follows the same path that the United States does. But I do think there are some basic principles that are important for us to uphold as friends and partners to the countries that we're talking to.The good news is, is that—take a country like Myanmar that just went through a historic election after having been subject for 40 years to military rule. They're not going to immediately be Sweden in terms of their democratic practices, but there is a sea change taking place there, and we want to encourage that and engage it.And a lot of the work that we do—the Open Government Partnership that we set up through the United Nations, the bilateral work we do in terms of improving transparency, the principles and rules that we've embedded in TPP—all those things are designed to raise the bar, to have people set sights that are a little bit higher. And some will go forward, some will slip back. Paces will vary, but the trajectory is the same, and that is a world where ordinary people are treated fairly, there's rule of law, there's transparency, governments are accountable, people's voices are heard, women are treated equally, minorities are not discriminated against.Those are profoundly American values, but I also think they are universal values.All right.

{"sentence": "The Chinese government has accused your administration of containing China while simultaneously seeking diplomatic engagement. How do you respond to that accusation? And do you believe President Xi is genuinely committed to improving relations given actions like banning Apple products in China? [SEP] Look, let me be clear: I am absolutely sincere about getting this relationship right. China is starting to shift the goalposts, especially when it comes to trade. For example, they're considering banning Chinese government officials from using Western cell phones. This trip wasn't about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I want a relationship that's fair, transparent, and based on clear rules. That means we need to be on the same page. We've been working for the last six months to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability. That's what this trip was about: fostering closer cooperation with India, Vietnam, and others. It's not about isolating China; it's about creating a stable base in the Indo-Pacific. When I discussed the Quad with President Xi, I explained that it's about maintaining stability, not isolating China.

But in my opinion, they're just using it as an excuse to try and—you know, Chuck Schumer came out with a strong statement today that you have to get back into school because it's good for the economy, but he has—he doesn't do it. He doesn't practice what he preaches.No, my people—Steve Mnuchin and our wonderful Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows—they're constantly on the phone with me. I'm totally involved with it.

{"sentence": "Q. That goes to Syria as well? [SEP] With respect to Syria, what's happening in Syria is heartbreaking and outrageous, and what you've seen is the international community mobilize against the Asad regime. And it's not a question of when Asad leaves or if Asad leaves, it's a question of when. He has lost the legitimacy of his people. And the actions that he's now taking against his own people is inexcusable, and the world community has said so in a more or less unified voice.On the other hand, for us to take military action unilaterally, as some have suggested, or to think that somehow there is some simple solution, I think is a mistake. What happened in Libya was we mobilized the international community, had a U.N. Security Council mandate, had the full cooperation of the region, Arab States, and we knew that we could execute very effectively in a relatively short period of time. This is a much more complicated situation.So what we've done is to work with key Arab States, key international partners--Hillary Clinton was in Tunisia--to come together and to mobilize and plan how do we support the opposition, how do we provide humanitarian assistance, how do we continue the political isolation, how do we continue the economic isolation. And we are going to continue to work on this project with other countries. And it is my belief that ultimately this dictator will fall, as dictators in the past have fallen.But the notion that the way to solve every one of these problems is to deploy our military, that hasn't been true in the past, and it won't be true now.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Before I get to my question, do we assume by how you're talking about the bill in the Senate that you are okay with the change in how to pay for it, the surtax--the 5.6-percent surtax on millionaires? [SEP] We've always said that we would be open to a variety of ways to pay for it. We put forward what we thought was a solid approach to paying for the jobs bill itself. Keep in mind, though, that what I've always said is that not only do we have to pay for the jobs bill, but we also still have to do more in order to reduce the debt and deficit.So the approach that the Senate is taking I'm comfortable with in order to deal with the jobs bill. We're still going to need to reform this Tax Code to make sure that we're closing loopholes, closing special interest tax breaks, making sure that the very simple principle, what we call the Buffett rule, which is that millionaires and billionaires aren't paying lower tax rates than ordinary families, that that's in place.

So how are you going to proceed with dialogue with North Korea? [SEP] Are you going to consider the nuclear weapons disarmament the same level as abduction issue? Well, maybe I'll go first. Abduction is a very important issue for me because it's very important to your Prime Minister. I will tell you that we were having dinner last night, and he started talking about abduction and how horrible it was. And his level of enthusiasm was unbelievable. And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.. Whether Japan will be left behind, that is not at all the case. In the last 2 days, together with President Trump, we have spoken about North Korea. There will be the inter-Korean talks, and a U.S.-North Korea summit is planned. We have gone into really in-depth discussion. About our policy and direction, we have reached agreement.Regarding the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, we hope that it will lead to the resolution of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missile, and of course, more than anything else, we hope it will be a historic summit that will lead to the resolution of abduction. And for that purpose, I have seriously and thoroughly discussed it with President Trump, and we have fully agreed about our direction going forward, in particular regarding abduction. As Donald has explained in our tête-à-tête, we have thoroughly discussed about this matter.Last year, the President met with the victims of the abduction, as well as the family members. And their families' feelings have been strongly felt and understood by the President, and he has given a very encouraging comment that he would appeal towards early resolution. I highly appreciate this encouraging comment. This gives us huge courage, a very encouraging comment. And for the families of the abductees, again, this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment.And therefore, going forward between Japan and the U.S., or between the trilateral of Japan, U.S., and South Korea, we will cooperate closely and do our utmost to resolve the issues of North Korea, including abduction, nuclear, and missiles.

{"sentence": "Q. Certainly. Thank you, President Duda. Clearly, you said you asked President Trump if he would consider a permanent base in Poland, and of course, that also relates to Russia. What would you say—how did the President respond to your position to have a permanent base from America in Poland?And then, also, do you currently have concerns over the U.S.-Russia relationship? [SEP] Well, of course. Of course, I told Mr. President about all the aspects connected with the permanent presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland. But, first and foremost, I assured Mr. President of one thing. First and foremost, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot say that, if there are permanent bases of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland, we will see a deterioration of security because that will lead to an increase in Russian activity and increased militarization of this part of Europe by Russia.I want to say it clearly, ladies and gentlemen: A very strong militarization of, for instance, Kaliningrad Oblast has taken place for more than 10 years now. It is the reality that we're living today. As far aggressive Russian behavior is concerned, as far as increased military activities concerned, including increasing of the militarization, Russia has been conducting such activities in a systematic way. And for the first time, we were able to see that in a materialized way in Georgia. In 2008, when the then-President of Poland, Professor Lech Kaczynski, took other European leaders, and they went to Tbilisi to stop Russian tanks, which were about to attack the capital of Georgia. And from that moment, that military expansion has been developing.It's another leg was the attack on Ukraine. And today we can see an illegal annexation of Crimea. Today, we are witnessing constant violation of international law in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. So these are today political and military facts of Europe, and the presence of the United States is only providing a guarantee of security and a possibility to defend.Because let me reiterate again: It is only about the guarantee of security and defense of our part of Europe that is the free world. This is the most crucial issue right now from our perspective, from the perspective of Central and Eastern European countries. And we are speaking in one voice on this one, generally.That is why we wanted to ensure the presence of the United States Armed Forces, and also, we wanted to have the presence of NATO forces in our part of Europe as well. And of course, Mr. President and his staff, his advisers, and also the Pentagon staff, have to consider all these issues, but there is a whole range of arguments which are in favor of the fact that the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in this area is absolutely justified today. That is due to the protection of the interests of the United States as well.So I'm absolutely convinced of this one, because today, unfortunately, we are seeing international law being violated. Today, we are seeing aggressive behaviors, and I am convinced that there is no more effective method of preventing a war than a decisive stance demonstrating that we are ready any moment to repel a possible attack. And presence also means deterrence. At the same time, I am convinced that when we are—when we have a strong military presence in this part of Europe where there is a potential threat, then there will be no war happening ever. And I think it should be pointed out that the President also said, and he also said it publicly, that he would pay the United States—meaning Poland would be paying billions of dollars for a base. And we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid.It's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people. And we should help them; we don't expect anything for that. But when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the United States, they're only taking advantage of us. And we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment. Payment. And we get along with them very well, but it's not fair. That includes NATO.As you know, I got $44 billion additional last year, where they paid an additional—you can speak to Secretary General Stoltenberg, who is the head of NATO, and he said he's never seen anything like it. And this year we did even better.But when a country is very wealthy, and when the United States has been protecting them for many years at tremendous cost—cost like nobody in this room would believe—it's time that they help with, we call it burden-sharing. And they will do that.But the President offered us much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we're looking at it. We're looking at it from the standpoint of, number one, military protection for both countries, and also cost, a term you don't hear too often and you haven't heard too often over the last 25 years.

Mr. President, with oil approaching $100 a barrel, are you concerned that your hard words for Iran on its nuclear program are helping drive up oil prices, which can end up hurting the U.S. economy?

Oil is going up because we use too much oil, and the capacity to replace reserves is dwindling. That's why the price of oil is going up.I believe it is important for us to send clear signals to the Iranian Government that the free world understands the risks of you trying to end up with a nuclear weapon. And therefore, we will work together to try to find if there's not rational people inside your Government who are tired of isolation and who believe there's a better way forward.Every time I give a talk about Iran, I make sure I speak to the Iranian people.

And when you throw into the mix radical Shi'a and radical Sunni trying to gain power and topple moderate governments, with energy which they could use to blackmail Great Britain or America or anybody else who doesn't kowtow to them, and a nuclear weapon in the hands of a government that is—would be using that nuclear weapon to blackmail to achieve political objectives, historians will look back and say, how come Bush and Blair couldn't see the threat?

It's in our interests.And one of the things that has changed for American foreign policy is a threat overseas can now come home to hurt us.

[SEP] Let me see if I can recall the specifics of ordering an investigation. It's not immediately coming to mind. I did express concerns about the persistent leaks. While I recognize the media's role in disseminating information, the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents is unacceptable. It's a recurring issue, not just for this administration, but for any administration attempting to implement policy. We've experienced numerous leaks, and pinpointing the source is often elusive. There might be an ongoing investigation; I'm simply not aware of it at this moment. However, it's imperative that individuals who leak classified materials are held accountable. Perhaps consequences would deter such actions in the future.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

It shows that Democrats and Republicans can have disagreements, even heated ones, but still find common ground to move the country forward. We saw that with the tax deal. I still believe that giving tax cuts to people who don't need them when we're facing deficits is a mistake. We're also going to have disagreements on spending priorities. We need to invest in education and research, but we also need to cut programs that aren't effective. But we've proven that we don't need to agree on everything to make progress for American families.

However, my primary focus remains on the pressing issues facing our nation. From what I gather, these individuals are deeply concerned about the direction in which our country is headed, particularly in certain urban centers controlled by the Democratic Party. They witness the challenges, the unrest, and the perceived erosion of law and order, and they yearn for solutions. They are, at their core, patriots who cherish America and desire to see it flourish.

{"sentence": "Q. ——are you worried that America is softening its stance on Kim Jong Il? [SEP] I have always believed that the best way to solve these difficult problems is through diplomacy. That's the first choice of the United States, to solve difficult problems diplomatically. I also believe that the best way for—and the difficult problem, of course, was to convincing the leader of North Korea to give up his nuclear weapons program.I also felt the best way forward was not for the United States to carry this diplomatic mission alone, and, therefore, worked very hard and closely with our Japanese allies to convince others to come to the table beside the United States. And now we have what we call the six-party talks, which is the United States, Japan, and China and South Korea and Russia, all saying the same message to North Korea, that we expect you to honor agreements you made, which include not only stopping their—locking down their plant but also dismantling their programs—and all programs—giving up weapons programs and weapons. That's what they've said they would do.We recently had a bump in the road to getting them to honor their agreement, and that is, there is a financial arrangement that we're now trying to clarify for the North Koreans, so that that will enable them to have no excuse for moving forward. And that's where we are right now.The interesting thing about our position is that if it looks like the North Korean leader is not going to honor his agreement, if it looks like that there are reasons other than the financial arrangements that will cause him to say, Well, I really don't mean what I said, we now have a structure in place to continue to provide a strong message to the North Korean. We have the capability of more sanctions. We have the capability of convincing other nations to send a clear message.So I like our position in terms of achieving this mission in a diplomatic way. And I want to thank the Prime Minister for being a strong advocate of sending a clear message to the North Korean leader that there's a better way forward than to defy the world.On all issues, there is a—whether it's this issue or any other issue—is that we will work with our partners to determine how long. But as I said, our patience is not unlimited. And that's the operative word for the leader in North Korea to understand. We hope he moves forward soon, obviously. Just like in—somebody asked me the other day, how long in Darfur? Well, the leaders will find out the definition of how long when we make it clear we're moving in a different direction. There's still time for the North Korean leader to make the right choice. Well, today on this issue, we had very candid exchange of views. And our understanding of the issue and the direction we are pursuing, we completely see eye to eye on this matter. And completely with that same attitude, we'll continue to deal with the North Korean issue.Well, we have to make the North Koreans understand that unless they keep up their promise, the difficult conditions they are—they find themselves under—the food situation and economic situation—they'll not be able to resolve those difficulties. And in fact, the situation would only worsen. So they need to respond properly on these issues; otherwise, we will have to take a tougher response on our side.In agreement with the procedures set down by the six-party talks, we'll have to continue to watch whether the North Koreans will actually act.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. With unemployment now at 9.2 percent and a large chunk of those lost jobs coming from the private sector, is now a really good time to cut trillions of dollars in spending? How will we still create jobs? And then to piggyback on the Social Security question, what do you say to members of your own party who say it doesn't contribute to the deficit, let's consider it, but not in the context of this deal? [SEP] Our biggest priority as an administration is getting the economy back on track and putting people back to work. Now, without relitigating the past, I'm absolutely convinced, and the vast majority of economists are convinced, that the steps we took in the Recovery Act saved millions of people their jobs or created a whole bunch of jobs.And part of the evidence of that is as you see what happens with the Recovery Act phasing out. When I came into office and budgets were hemorrhaging at the State level, part of the Recovery Act was giving States help so they wouldn't have to lay off teachers, police officers, firefighters. As we've seen that Federal support for States diminish, you've seen the biggest job losses in the public sector, teachers, police officers, firefighters losing their jobs.So my strong preference would be for us to figure out ways that we can continue to provide help across the board. But I'm operating within some political constraints here, because whatever I do has to go through the House of Representatives.What that means then is, is that among the options that are available to us is, for example, the payroll tax cut, which might not be exactly the kind of program that I would design in order to boost employment, but does make a difference because it puts money in the pockets of people who are then spending it at businesses, large and small. That gives them more customers, increases demand, and it gives businesses a greater incentive to hire. And that would be, for example, a component of this overall package.Unemployment benefits, again, puts money in the pockets of folks who are out there knocking on doors trying to find a job every day. Giving them those resources, that puts more money into the economy and that potentially improves it--improves the climate for businesses to want to hire.So as part of a component of a deal, I think it's very important for us to look at what are the steps we can take short term in order to put folks back to work. I am not somebody who believes that just because we solve the deficit and debt problems short term, medium term, or long term, that that automatically solves the unemployment problem. I think we're still going to have to do a bunch of stuff, including, for example, trade deals that are before Congress right now that could add tens of thousands of jobs.Republicans gave me this list at the beginning of this year as a priority, something that they thought they could do. Now I'm ready to do it, and so far we haven't gotten the kind of movement that I would have expected.We've got the potential to create an infrastructure bank that could put construction workers to work right now, rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our vital infrastructure all across the country. So those are still areas where, I think, we can make enormous progress.I do think that if the country as a whole sees Washington act responsibly, compromises being made, the deficit and debt being dealt with for 10, 15, 20 years, that that will help with businesses feeling more confident about aggressively investing in this country, foreign investors saying America has got its act together and are willing to invest. And so it can have a positive impact in overall growth and employment.It's not the only solution. We're still going to have to have a strong jobs agenda. But it is part of a solution. I might add it is the primary solution that the Republicans have offered when it comes to jobs. They keep on going out there and saying, Mr. President, what are you doing about jobs? And when you ask them, well, what would you do? We've got to get Government spending under control, and we've got to get our deficits under control. So I say, okay, let's go. Where are they? I mean, this is what they claim would be the single biggest boost to business certainty and confidence. So what's the holdup?With respect to Social Security, as I indicated earlier, making changes to these programs is so difficult that this may be an opportunity for us to go ahead and do something smart that strengthens Social Security and gives not just this generation but future generations the opportunity to say this thing is going to be in there for the long haul.Now, that may not be possible, and you're absolutely right that, as I said, Social Security is not the primary driver of our long-term deficits and debt. On the other hand, we do want to make sure that Social Security is going to be there for the next generations, and if there is a reasonable deal to be had on it, it is one that I'm willing to pursue.", "label": "Implicit"}

He was sent by his father to a madrassa to get education because he could not any more afford to have him in school, because his mother had a heart ailment, and they had to spend money on her treatment.Having sent the boy to a madrassa, he disappeared from there. After a few months, his father heard that he was arrested in Afghanistan, and then he came to Afghanistan. And having seen that this was a teenage—rather, legally underage innocent boy used by terrorists to kill himself and to kill other innocent people, I felt that it was the right decision to pardon him, to give him a new opportunity for education and a new life, and to send a message to his mother that your child is going to be back with you. I am very glad I did that.But this gives us a lesson about those who are the enemies of all of us, the enemies of people who use young children, who brainwashes them, and who forces them to kill themselves.The message should be clear to the rest of the world about the evil that we are fighting, the heartless people that we are fighting, who don't even have any feeling for young children, for babies, for teenagers. Most of that, we know today, that the terrorists are buying and selling suicide bombers. We have received calls in our Government offices by handlers of suicide bombers that they want to sell them to us. So it's become a trade, a mean trade; merchants of death are around there.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, you describe your hopes rather more in great historical terms. Let me break this down to months and years. The fact that Stephen Bannon was made as chief strategist, meeting Mr. Farage, and the fact that prominent Republican representatives did not decide to join this transition team—what makes you confident, against the background of this, that President Trump can be a reliable partner to the world and to Europe and Germany?Now, Madam Chancellor, if you hear those words of praise of the President with regard to you—this, what he said, can this not sort of demand too much from you and from Germany? Because too much is demanded, too much is expected from you—too great are the expectations, you can't meet them? [SEP] I'm always optimistic. [] There are times where I was in the Oval Office and people would come to me with all kinds of political problems and policy problems and international problems, and my team would be getting discouraged and depressed, and I would say to them, I have to be optimistic, because the odds of somebody named Barack Obama being President of the United States were very low, and the fact that, in my lifetime, I have seen such enormous, positive change in the United States and around the world tells me that, although history does not travel in a straight line, it moves in the direction of justice and freedom and a better life for people. But we have to fight for it. We have to work for it.What makes me cautiously optimistic about my successor and the shift from campaign mode to governance is, there is something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States—not just by its own people, but by people around the world—that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness. And if you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long, because it will expose problems. Even when you're doing a good job, even when you are attentive, there are so many things that come across your desk that people are going to question you, and there—you're going to have opponents, and you're going to have critics. And you figure that out pretty fast when you're sitting there. And I think the President-elect is going to see fairly quickly that the demands and responsibilities of a U.S. President are not ones that you can treat casually and that in a big, complex, diverse country, the only way that you can be successful is by listening and reaching out and working with a wide variety of people.And so it is my hope that that is what will happen. And I'm going to do everything I can over the next 2 months to help assure that that happens.It is absolutely true that Chancellor Merkel is going to have significant responsibilities, has had extraordinary burdens that she's had to carry. If she chooses to continue, you're right, she will have big burdens. I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she's tough. [] And I have—I know what it means to carry burdens because the fact of the matter is, is that if there are problems around the world, the first question people ask is, why isn't Washington doing something about it?This is why it's so important not to discount or take for granted the importance of the transatlantic alliance. And this is probably the best place for me to end.In international fora—in G-20s, in G-7s, in the United Nations—the United States and Germany are not always perfectly aligned. America and Europe are not always perfectly aligned. But the voice that speaks out on behalf of some dissident who is jailed halfway around the world, the voice who is expressing concern about some child in an African village who doesn't have clean drinking water or is subject to some terrible disease, the voice that insists on rules and norms governing international affairs, the voice that helps to steer the world away from war wherever possible—that's our voice more often than not.And we're not always successful. But if that voice is absent, or if that voice is divided, we will be living in a meaner, harsher, more troubled world. And we have to remember that. And whoever is the U.S. President and whoever is the Chancellor of Germany and whoever is the leader of other European nations and other democracies around the world, they need to recognize that.There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism, for looking the other way with somebody else's problems, that are not going to champion people who are vulnerable, because sometimes that's politically convenient. And if we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worse world. We will go backwards instead of forwards.So whoever the U.S. President is, whoever the Chancellor of Germany is, we need to remember that. And our citizenry who decide who our Presidents and Chancellors are need to remember that. Well, first, it is, after all, a very good thing if, after 8 years of cooperation, the President of the United States says that this is a cooperation based on friendship, that we cooperated well. I feel that this is a very good, a very positive message and, indeed, an encouragement for me.Now, secondly, I, fortunately, know very many people—and there are many, many more that I don't know—and many politicians who stand up for the same values of democracy, of liberal societies, of open societies, of respect for the dignity of man. And I feel that we are in a community of people here who stand up for these values, who try to maintain them, and wherever they are not yet respected, stand up for people's rights to enjoy them as well.And this is worth every effort.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the Supreme Court's decision on climate change yesterday, what are your thoughts? Does this ruling essentially mandate broad caps on greenhouse gas emissions? [SEP] Well, the Supreme Court has spoken, and we respect their decision as the law of the land. We're currently analyzing the implications. The ruling specifically addresses emissions from automobiles. Now, we've already proposed a plan to tackle greenhouse gases from vehicles. This involves a mandatory fuel standard requiring 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels by 2017, reducing gasoline use by 20% and halting the growth of greenhouse gases from cars. Congress has a clear path forward here, and I urge them to act swiftly. On the broader issue, let me be clear: I take this seriously. Man contributes to greenhouse gases, but any solution must not harm economic growth. Why? Because it's about jobs and because new, expensive technologies are needed, and prosperity makes them affordable. Secondly, we need international cooperation, especially with China and India. So, the principles guiding us are: encouraging technology, growing the economy, and ensuring global participation. Now, who's next?", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. You said during this election that while your name wasn't on the ballot, your policies were. And despite the optimism that you're expressing here, last night was a devastating night for your party. Given that, do you feel any responsibility to recalibrate your agenda for the next 2 years? And what changes do you need to make in your White House and in your dealings with Republicans in order to address the concerns that voters expressed with your administration? [SEP] Well, as I said in my opening remarks, the American people overwhelmingly believe that this town doesn't work well and that it is not attentive to their needs. And as President, they rightly hold me accountable to do more to make it work properly. I'm the guy who's elected by everybody, not just from a particular State or a particular district. And they want me to push hard to close some of these divisions, break through some of the gridlock, and get stuff done. So the most important thing I can do is just get stuff done and help Congress get some things done.In terms of agenda items, though, Julie, if you look, as I just mentioned, to a minimum wage increase, for example, that's something I talked about a lot during the campaign. Where voters had a chance to vote directly on that agenda item, they voted for it. And so I think it would be hard to suggest that people aren't supportive of it. We know that the surveys consistently say they want to see that happen.The key is to find areas where the agenda that I've put forward, one that I believe will help strengthen the middle class and create more ladders of opportunity into the middle class and improve our schools and make college more affordable to more young people and make sure that we're growing faster as an economy and we stay competitive—the key is to make sure that those ideas that I have overlap somewhere with some of the ideas that Republicans have.There's not going to be perfect overlap. I mean, there are going to be some ideas that I've got that, I think the evidence backs up, would be good for the economy, and Republicans disagree. They're not going to support those ideas. But I'm going to keep on arguing for them because I think they're the right thing for the country to do. There are going to be some ideas that they've got that they believe will improve the economy or create jobs that, from my perspective, isn't going to help middle class families improve their economic situation, so I probably won't support theirs.But I do think there are going to be areas where we do agree: on infrastructure, on making sure that we're boosting American exports. And part of my task, then, is to reach out to Republicans, make sure that I'm listening to them. I'm looking forward to them putting forward a very specific agenda in terms of what they would like to accomplish. Let's compare notes in terms of what I'm looking at and what they're looking at, and let's get started on those things where we agree. Even if we don't agree 100 percent, let's get started on those things where we agree 70, 80, 90 percent. And if we can do that and build up some trust and improve how processes work in Washington, then I think that's going to give the American people a little bit more confidence that, in fact, their Government is looking after them.", "label": "General"}

We are employing a multi-faceted approach to prevent the flow of arms to destabilizing actors. We've secured extensions to the UN arms embargo, but more importantly, we are actively working with our allies to improve intelligence gathering and interdiction efforts. The legal framework is only as effective as our ability to enforce it.

He must recognize that an invasion of Ukraine would be a monumental blunder. The ramifications for Europe and the global community would be catastrophic, and he would face severe consequences. I've been extremely forthright with President Putin, both in our phone conversations and in person. We are prepared to implement the most stringent economic sanctions ever imposed, and the repercussions would be substantial. Others will also be affected, including ourselves and the European nations, but his economy would bear the brunt of the impact.

And I know you're not going to want to step all over what you're going to say tomorrow. However, we do know from your advisers that you plan to recommend the creation of a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. So you'll have the CFPA, you've got the Fed, the SEC, the FDIC, and on and on; it's like alphabet soup. Why did you decide not to consolidate agencies, but instead to add to the agencies? Isn't too many agencies part of the problem? [SEP] You're right; I don't want to step on my announcement tomorrow. So let me just speak in broad principles, and then tomorrow you'll have a chance to ask questions of the administration about exactly what we've proposed.The broad principle is that a lack of oversight, a series of regulatory gaps allowed financial institutions--not just banks, but non-bank institutions--to engage in wild risk-taking that didn't simply imperil those institutions, but imperiled the United States economy and had a profound recessionary effect on the world economy. We have to make sure that we've got a updated regulatory system--that hasn't been significantly changed since the 1930s--to deal with enormous global capital flows and a range of new instruments and risk-taking that has been very dangerous for the American people.We are going to put forward a very strong set of regulatory measures that we think can prevent this kind of crisis from happening again. We expect that Congress will work swiftly to get these laws in place. I want to sign them, and we want to get them up and running.And I think when you see the overall approach that we're taking, you'll see that we have not, in fact, added a whole host of regulatory agencies. In fact, there's going to be streamlining, consolidation, and additional overlap so that you don't find people falling through the gaps, whether it's on the consumer protection side, the investor protection side, the systemic risk that we need to make sure is avoided, on all those issues that's going to be a much more effectively integrated system than previously.But it's going to be, as usual, a heavy lift, because there are going to be people who want to keep on taking these risks, counting on U.S. taxpayers to bail them out if their bets go bad. And you'll hear a lot of chatter about, we don't need more regulation and government needs to get off our backs. There's a short memory, unfortunately, and I think that's what some of the special interests and lobbyists are going to be counting on, that somehow we've forgotten the disaster that arose out of their reckless behavior.

But the question that confronts us all is: when do we draw the line and confront actions that violate our common humanity? Seeing children gassed, innocent civilians dying senselessly, and having the capacity to take meaningful action, even if incomplete, the moral imperative is to not stand idly by. This is the most difficult aspect of this job. I would much prefer to focus on early childhood education than preventing chemical attacks on young children. Unfortunately, these are the decisions I face as President.

[SEP] Those are important questions, but they don't fully capture the scope of our relationship with China. I've known Xi Jinping for quite some time, longer than many other world leaders. We've had extensive discussions, going into great detail. He's very direct, but he's not a democrat in the traditional sense. He believes autocracy is the way forward. After my election, we had a lengthy conversation. I emphasized that we're not seeking conflict, but we will engage in strong competition and demand that China adhere to international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. To compete effectively, we must invest in American workers and scientific innovation. We once dedicated over 2% of our GDP to research; now it's only 0.7%. I intend to reverse that trend. We're also committed to strengthening our alliances. This isn't about being anti-China; it's about democracies working together. I'll be speaking with European leaders shortly, and I recently met with the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the US) to ensure China is held accountable. I'm also planning to convene an alliance of democracies to discuss the future. We must hold China accountable for its actions in the South China Sea, regarding Taiwan, and on human rights.

[SEP] No, the goals are the same; achieving those goals have been slower than we thought. And the question is, one, whether or not it's worth it to try to achieve the goals. I believe it's worth it for the security of the country. And the reason why I believe it's for the security of the country is that if we were to leave before the job was done, extremist groups like Al Qaida would be able to gain safe haven. That's what they've said they want. They believe we won't have the will to hang in there and help this i Government succeed. And they want us out.And so the goals of helping is provide their own securities remain the same, and the goals are important toward achieving our objective, and our objective is important for the security of the country. I also believe that a democracy in the heart of the Middle East will be a major blow to extremists or radicals wherever they live in the Middle East. And just yesterday we saw an attack on an anti-Syrian/pro-Lebanese democracy advocate. Now, I don't know who did that, but I do know it is typical of this war we're fighting in, when extremists kill innocent people in order to undermine democracies.One of the things I feel passionately about is for the United States to recognize what a Middle East would be like if terrorists and extremists were—would have safe haven and were emboldened by a U.S. defeat.

I would, in fact, put it in terms of how much interest does he have in burnishing 's reputation that is not—is viewed as not being contrary to democratic principles and free speech.That's a judgment I cannot make. I don't know. But it's not because I think he is interested in changing the nature of a closed society or closed government's actions relative to what he thinks is the right of government to do what it does; it's a very different approach.And you know, there's a couple of really good biographies—I told him I read a couple—I read most everything he's written and the speeches he's made. And I've read a couple of very good biographies, which many of you have as well.And I think I pointed out to him that had an opportunity—that brief shining moment after Gorbachev and after things began to change drastically—to actually generate a democratic government. But what happened was, it failed and there was a great, great race among n intellectuals to determine what form of government would they choose and how would they choose it.And based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided was that has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a n state, not based on ideology—whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution—the n Revolution, and to where they are today.And I think that it's clear to me—and I've said it—that I think he decided that the way for to be able to sustain itself as a great—quote, great power is to in fact unite the n people on just the strength of the government—the government controls—not necessarily ideologically, but the government.And I think that's the choice that was made.

That's your domain. Plenty of folks are eager to speculate, but I won't be one of them. On Cuba, we're focused on empowering the Cuban people with freedom and self-determination, supporting their civil society. Change will happen in Cuba, regardless of our actions, partly due to generational shifts. President Castro's references to pre-birth events highlight this. The Cold War is over. We still face global challenges and have serious concerns about Cuba's government and regional actions. However, cooperation is possible, like Cuban doctors during Ebola and Haiti's earthquake. I told President Castro our views are clear, and we'll advocate through persuasion, as these issues don't directly threaten our national security. Cuba isn't a threat to the U.S., though we have differences. My concerns include ISIL, Iran's nuclear ambitions, Yemen, Libya, Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and climate change.

But if they do, we want to make sure our airlines stay strong. It's funny, I was just talking to Doug, and their retail numbers are through the roof – I guess because of all this, your business is booming. You've all been selling a lot of stuff. Doug, can you speak to the hand sanitizer issue? Sure. Yes, the areas where we're seeing supply chain challenges are surface cleaners, cleaning supplies, and paper goods.

We think the best way forward is to work with Egypt to stop weapons from getting into Gaza, which allows Hamas to keep firing rockets. Countries that give weapons to Hamas need to stop doing so. The international community needs to keep pushing them to stop providing weapons. Hamas, of course, needs to stop arming if they want a sustainable ceasefire.

{"sentence": "So, you're not ruling out that she was terminated? [SEP] I'm telling you, I literally just found out about this this morning. I don't have all the facts yet. Ken Salazar's been busy on Capitol Hill. The key thing here is that reforms at MMS clearly weren't happening quickly enough. Now, even if they *were*, maybe this still would have happened. That's what this Commission needs to determine: was this a systemic issue, or just an incredibly rare event? What are the actual risks involved? Let's be clear, the fact that oil companies are now drilling a mile underwater and then another three miles down to reach oil tells us something important. Extraction is becoming more expensive and inherently riskier. That's why I never embraced the 'Drill, baby, drill' mantra. We can't simply drill our way out of this problem. Oil can be a bridge to new technologies and energy sources, but we need to recognize that the easily accessible oil is already gone. As technology advances and oil sources become more remote, the risks will likely increase. As a society, we need to make some serious decisions about the risks we're willing to accept. That's something the Commission will need to examine. We're going to continue to need oil for our industries and our way of life, but we must start transitioning to new energy sources. That's why I spoke with the Republican caucus this week, urging them to work together. Senators Lieberman and Kerry, along with Lindsey Graham previously, have developed a framework that could garner bipartisan support. We'll still need oil production, but we must acknowledge the challenges on the horizon and change our approach. Next question, please.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

Did those comments about President Xi undermine or complicate the progress your administration has made in maintaining a relationship with China?And secondly, on India: As you raise these broader issues of human rights and democracy, what is your message to those, including some members of your own party, who say that your administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and crackdown on dissent in Prime Minister Modi's country?

A good relationship is very important. Having a relationship with Russia and other countries is a good thing. I've been saying that for years, and certainly during my campaign. The meeting with NATO yesterday was incredibly significant. We transformed an unfair situation into something unified. They were energized and committed. They need approval from their parliaments, but they're ready to increase their contributions. Stoltenberg is doing a terrific job. He said yesterday that because of me, we've taken in $34 billion more for NATO. I think the number is actually much higher. My opponent wouldn't have done that.

More than anything, I hoped my voice encouraged Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race. To recognize that slavery and Jim Crow didn't vanish with the Civil Rights Act or my election. Things have gotten better, but we still have a lot more work to do. I tried to encourage practical solutions to reduce racial bias.

[SEP] As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long period of reflection, I concluded that we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples when it comes to marriage; that the basic principle that America is founded on—the idea that we're all created equal—applies to everybody, regardless of sexual orientation, as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.And I think that the same evolution that I've gone through is an evolution that the country as a whole has gone through. And I think it is a profoundly positive thing. So that when the Supreme Court essentially called the question by taking this case about California's law, I didn't feel like that was something that this administration could avoid.

President Obama and I have a strong, trusting relationship. We may have occasional differences, but our shared values and people-to-people connections will keep us strong.

Congress controls the purse strings. I wish we could pass a major infrastructure bill, create jobs, and stimulate the economy. But without congressional cooperation, my options are limited. I can expedite permits and encourage private investment, but ultimately, Congress must authorize spending. So, there's no blank check. However, I will always use my legal authority to improve the lives of middle-class Americans. Whether it's ensuring fair wages for federal contractors or expanding access to affordable student loans, I will act. That's what the American people expect.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. On China, you—sorry—China seems to be to doing exactly what it wants to do with regard to Hong Kong, with regard to Xinjiang, with the South China Sea, and many other issues, despite pressure from you and from allies.The final language in the G-7 communiqué does have some mentions of China, which is different from past years, but I know it's not as tough as you and your team wanted it to be. We've saw—we saw a draft of the communiqué, and it's not quite as tough.So why isn't it as tough? There isn't very much action in it. There's some calls for China to be respectful. But why isn't that communiqué a little bit tougher? Are you disappointed in that? And what can you do to change some of these actions by China? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think it—as you know, last time the G-7 met, there was no mention of China. But this time, there is mention of China. The G-7 explicitly agreed to call out human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong explicitly.Two, to coordinate a common strategy to deal with China nonmarket policies that undermine competition. They've agreed—and that's underway now—how to do that.Three, to take serious actions against forced labor in solar, agriculture, and the garment industries because that's where it's happening. And they've agreed we will do that.To launch—what I said earlier; I really feel very strongly—I proposed that we have a democratic alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative: the Build Back Better. And they've agreed to that, and that's underway as the details of that—we agreed that we'd put together a committee to do that and come up with that. And thirdly, that we are going to insist on a high-standards to be—for a climate-friendly, transparent alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. And—but, in the meantime, we're going to move forward.Look, I think it's always—let me put it this way: I know this is going sound somewhat prosaic, but I think we're in a contest, not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century.And I think how we act and whether we pull together as democracies is going to determine whether our grandkids look back 15 years from now and say, Did they step up? Are democracies as relevant and as powerful as they have been?And I walked away from the meeting with all my colleagues believing that they are convinced that that is correct now too. Not—I shouldn't say now. Not just because of me, but they believe that to be the case.And so I think you're going to see just straightforward dealing with China. And again, we're not looking—as I've told Xi Jinping myself, I'm not looking for conflict. Where we can cooperate, we'll cooperate. Where we disagree, I'm going to state it frankly, and we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent.For example, we talked about trade. It's one thing to talk about whether or not our agricultural policy makes sense.

The last time the American people heard about a review of the war, it ended up in a surge of U.S. troops in Iraq. Can the U.S. expect a surge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan? And do you agree with many analysts who say that the real problem in Afghanistan—or a major problem is that the NATO allies are not getting it done or avoiding the fight there? [SEP] Part of the review is to assess how best to make sure our coalition partners realize there is a coherent strategy of which they are an integral part, all aiming to make sure that there is a presence that will assure the Afghan Government and the Afghan people that people will be trying to help them with their security.It is—it makes sense for us to constantly review our strategies in a variety of theaters. That's what good governance is: You analyze the situation a year after the previous strategy to determine whether or not—what worked and what didn't work. What did work was the—you might remember last year; I guess there was a lot of talk about the Taliban surge or the Taliban offensive. And General McNeill informed us that the only team that's going to be on the offense is American and NATO allies and other allies.And we were on the offense. And the Taliban got hit hard last year. The question, of course, is—just like in Iraq—is there a followup to the security gains? In other words, is life changing better for the average citizen? That's the question that we all got to be looking at. Unity governments are important, but does the average citizen realize that a free society is in his or her interest.And I visited with President Karzai on the SVTS the other day, and it's a question I basically asked him. I said, we were successful militarily; what's happened in your country that you can point to that indicates that you're taking advantage of better security in certain places?And he pointed out some interesting things. He talked about the—I think it's 5 million children now going to school. It was an interesting measurement for him. He says, I believe we're taking advantage of the security because more of our children are getting educated. He told us a story—I can't remember the exact Province—about when he was part of the struggle against the Taliban. Somebody got wounded; he took them to the hospital— there was nothing there. You know, it was like they called it a hospital. It was just kind of a rundown place where a person couldn't get much good health care. And now, all of a sudden, he talks about an expanding health care system and the infant mortality rate dropping. He talks about the roads that are being built so that the average citizen there can get their crops to market. And we checked into his assertions, and they're true. So this is a society where—that is evolving.Now, it takes a while for societies that have been brutalized by tyranny and wracked by war to meet expectations. So the questions I ask on Iraq and Afghanistan are: Is there progress? Are people feeling better about life? And of course, we press their governments to work to come together and get budgets passed, or in Iraq's case, de-Ba'athification law or oil laws. And those are all important. But also what's important is the human condition. And I believe we're making progress on both fronts.Yes, sir.", "label": "Dodging"}

I'll never forget having a conversation with then my—my then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. It was early on in the administration, and we were talking about priorities and matters of emphasis.And she asked me whether or not I really cared about Africa, and my answer to her then is the same answer I will give to you now: Absolutely. It's in our national interests that America help deal with hopelessness, and it's our moral interests that we help brothers and sisters who hurt. It's been the policy of the Bush administration since day one. That's why, in the first 4 years of my administration, I went to Congress, and I asked them to double foreign aid to Africa. And then, as I began the second half of my administration, I asked them to double it again. Why? Because it's in our interests to work on issues such as malaria and AIDS.It also appalled me very on, sir, in my administration to realize that an entire generation of people could be lost to HIV/ AIDS and that those of us who were comfortable weren't doing much about it. I'm a man who believes in certain principles, and I refuse to yield from those principles. And one such principle is that to whom much is given, much is required. And a lot has been given to the United States of America. We're a blessed nation. And therefore, I felt all along it was incumbent upon us to help deal with this pandemic that was—could have literally wiped out an entire generation of Africans and left thousands and thousands of boys and girls orphaned.And so this has been a priority of mine. Why finally getting to Tanzania? I don't have many excuses, except I've been a pretty busy guy. [] And secondly, it seems like a fortuitous time to come. After all, the results of our efforts are becoming more and more tangible, and there's no better place to come than a place where people achieve results.Now, there's still a lot of conflict here on this continent; I understand that. I was asked yesterday, Well, how come you're not going to the places of conflict? Well, one reason you go to places of success is to show people what's possible. I am going tomorrow [Tuesday] * to a place that had been in serious conflict, however, and that's Rwanda. And one of the reasons I'm going there is to show that after this horrible situation that occurred, there's life and there's hope and there's progress.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, PM Lee and President Obama. First question is for Prime Minister Lee. You've spoken about the continuation of the U.S. rebalance being a significant part of peace and stability in Asia. How do you envision this continuation proceeding in the next 50 years? And what role do you see Singapore playing in this context? What are some of the hot-button issues that we're likely to face as the U.S., hopefully, continues its rebalance?Second question. You've mentioned the strong bipartisan links that Singapore has had with nine different U.S. Presidents from both sides of the political divide, a very strong record there. How would we address a U.S. leader which adopts a stance that it's more closed off, more antiglobalization, for example, if we see that in November? [SEP] S., especially coming on the heels of the latest announcement of the medical team to the global coalition against ISIS. With the rising threat of terror in Asia and indeed the rest of the world, the potential for military confrontation in the South China Sea, how do you see Singapore featuring in U.S. plans to address this going forward?And last question, Four more years is a phrase that I think you've been hearing a little bit in the past few weeks and months. And while that's not possible—[]—if it were, how would you continue developing relationships with Singapore? What would be your key focus going forward, maybe the next 50 years as well? Thank you. Well, 50 years is a very long time. [] Fifty years ago, nobody imagined what the world would be like today or what Singapore would be like today, and that we would have such a deep and broad relationship and so many things to do together.We would like to build on this for the next 50 years. It depends on how we—each of our countries does: in Singapore, whether we are able to remain stable, prosperous, open, successful; in America, whether you remain one of the dynamic, vibrant, leading economies in the world, in a world in which there are other powers, other centers of creativity and technology and science and progress, but yet it's a unique participant with a history of contributing to the world not just for your own interests, but because you believe that the world should be a better place for all countries.And if America can do that, and if Singapore can maintain our success, then I think there are many opportunities for us to make common cause together. And then, the rebalancing, which the President has enunciated and executed, will sustain and endure for many years to come. It will be a very different world. The countries will grow; other countries will slow down. Demographics will have a big factor to come. I mean, if we look at Japan, their population has been shrinking, and they will have to do something, somehow, to turn it around. Otherwise, 50 more years of population shrinking and you have a very small country left in terms of economy, in terms of influence internationally.Singapore, too, has demographic issues. America has a demographic change—the population is not shrinking, but the composition is changing. And in this situation, we have to adjust to a new world, maintaining our position and our ability to compete and yet knowing that it's not going to be the same as it was in 1946, when America was about half the world's GDP. So—or one-quarter of the world's GDP.So that's the crucial factor over the next 50 years. As for what we do over bipartisan links, if there's a U.S. leader who is more closed off and wants to turn inward, I don't think this is the right forum or indeed there is any right forum for me to talk about U.S. politics in public at this moment. We will work with whoever is the U.S. administration, whichever party. We've worked with five Republican and four Democratic administrations. And our experience of American elections, Presidential elections, has been that many pressures build up during the election campaign. And after the elections, in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are rethought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It doesn't turn completely upside down.The Americans take pride in having a system with checks of—with checks and balances so that it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. [] No. And we admire that, and sometimes, we depend upon that. [] The—he's absolutely right. [] The wisdom of our Founders.With respect to military cooperation, obviously, Singapore is a small country, but as I've said before, it punches above its weight. Because so much of our work in the Asia-Pacific region is not a matter of active conflict, but rather creating an architecture, a framework of rules and norms that keeps the peace and that has underwritten security for the region and for us for many years now. And Singapore is so often the adult in the room, the level head, that can help us work with a wide range of countries around certain issues, help defuse tensions. In many ways, the diplomatic work and collaboration that we do with Singapore is as critical, if not more critical, than the work militarily.But what is also true is the nature of threats today, when you think of cyber threats or our concern about enforcing sanctions against North Korea to ensure nonproliferation of nuclear materials or being able to countermessage ISIL in a place like Southeast Asia and ensure information sharing with countries where there may be a budding terrorist threat, those are all issues of military finesse and intelligence and precision, and that—those are areas where Singapore excels.So in addition to being a very important logistical hub and center for our operations, the partnership that we're able to maintain helps us to work with a whole range of other countries much more effectively than we would if Singapore weren't there and we were having to just try to gather up all these countries individually. And that's where ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, I think, has also been very important, because it is institutionalizing many of these practices in ways that, hopefully, avoids conflict in the first place, which would be in everybody's interest.With the—as far as where the relationship goes, I think the Prime Minister is absolutely right: Fifty years from now, it's very hard to anticipate where we're going, but there are certain trends that I think are inevitable. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow and will continue to account for a larger share of the world's economy. There are going to be countries in the Southeast Asian region that look to follow the path of Singapore into a mature, advanced economy. It is going to be a big market. And the United States is still going to have a massive interest in maintaining itself as a Asia-Pacific power and in maintaining strong bonds of trade and commerce and scientific exchange and educational exchange.And given the close strategic interests, but maybe even more importantly, the close people-to-people ties between America and Singapore, I think we can anticipate that that will be just as strong 50 years from now as it is today.The—Singapore has to take into account not just American interests. China is a big neighbor, and there are strong commercial ties and cultural ties there as well. And in that sense, Singapore actually can serve as a useful partner with us and with China to assure that the U.S.-Sino relationship moves in a productive way, which I think would be in the interests of both countries.So this is going to be a central engine for world growth. And if we do a good job in maintaining stability, ensuring a rules-based order, continuing to promote greater transparency and reducing corruption in the region so that all people are benefiting from the rapid growth that is taking place, then I think the future 50 years from now will be bright.Jordan Fabian [The Hill].", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much. Parwiz Kawa from Kabul-based—[inaudible]—Sobh daily newspaper. President Obama, you're talking about the long-term strategic partnership between Afghanistan and United States. At the same time, you're talking about deadlines about the withdrawal of the soldiers from Afghanistan. How do you ensure the long term—or how do you define the long-term strategy partnership after 2017, or from 2017 onward?[At this point, the reporter spoke in Dari, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. Mr. President Ghani, I wanted to—what do you expect, Mr. President—what would the expectation coming to the United States and what would you like to return with to Afghanistan? [SEP] Oh, no. Please.[.] Our expectations were that our cooperation will be enhanced and we will have a clear vision and practical vision for cooperation—for an enduring cooperation with the United States be there. And this change of environment has occurred, and today, the United States Government and—considers the Government of Afghanistan a really reliable partner.Commitments that are made are considerable, and the funding proposal of supporting Afghan security forces by 2017 and it has reached to $4.1 billion. It's nothing less—it's a significant issue, it's a very important issue.And also, yesterday there was a new framework of our economic cooperation was laid out, according to which $800 million were made—a commitment were made, those will be spent through the Afghan budget. But most importantly is the flexibility that has been shown in the area of security cooperation. And this flexibility is going to ensure and provide confidence to our security forces and our people and also is going to send a very strong message to the region that this cooperation is not short term, but is enduring and long term. . Our strategic partnership is based on a very simple principle. We want the Afghan people, through their security forces directed by their President and Commander in Chief, to be able to provide for their own security. And our goal is to make sure that we are a strong partner in helping to build and sustain effective Afghan security forces.So, from the start, when I first came into office, we put additional U.S. troops, coalition troops, and resources into Afghanistan to shift momentum at a time when the Taliban and the enemies of peace and stability inside of Afghanistan, I think, were moving and had momentum.We broke that momentum, elections took place, and the Afghan National Security Forces began to build up and get trained and become more and more effective. And because of a successful election and a national unity Government and the leadership of President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah, we are now in a position where the Afghan security forces are not only more effective, but they're also better directed by the civilian Government.We've been able to draw down and remove ourselves from a combat role, as doctor—as President Ghani indicated, without collapse, as was predicted. And Afghan soldiers have fought, and they've fought well. And obviously, there are still improvements to be made, but they're making significant progress.So the strategic partnership involves us continuing to help support Afghan security forces. That means financially. The international community is going to have to continue to provide assistance to the Afghan Government, which is carrying a significant security load not only for itself, but for the region and, in some ways, the world. And we've made a commitment to do that.We're going to continue to provide the kind of security cooperation and support that is required—training, assisting, advising, helping on logistics, helping on developing enabler capacity—all the things that go into a modern military, a professional military, a professional police force that can provide security on Afghan soil by Afghans.And the cooperation and the strategic partnership involves building up the prosperity and opportunities for the Afghan people through the economic development that was mentioned by the President.So we intend to be working with the Afghan Government and the Afghan people for a long time. And in many ways, our troop presence, our military assistance is just one component of what is a much larger process. And the more successful we are in building Afghan capacity and strengthening the Afghan economy, the more the strategic partnership that we have will be like the partnership that we have with many countries around the world. And it will be based on mutual interest and scientific and educational exchanges and business opportunities and commerce and trade. And that, I think, is the goal that we're all looking for.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about two economic matters. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke warned Congress this week that the economic recovery is close to faltering. Do you agree?And secondly, on your jobs bill, the American people are sick of games, and you mentioned games in your comments. They want results. Wouldn't it be more productive to work with Republicans on a plan that you know could pass Congress as opposed to going around the country talking about your bill and singling out--calling out Republicans by name? [SEP] Well, first of all, with respect to the state of the economy, there is no doubt that growth has slowed. I think people were much more optimistic at the beginning of this year. But the combination of a Japanese tsunami, the Arab Spring, which drove up gas prices, and most prominently, Europe, I think, has gotten businesses and consumers very nervous. And we did not help here in Washington with the debt ceiling debacle that took place, a bit of game-playing that was completely unnecessary, completely unprecedented in terms of how we dealt with our responsibilities here in Washington.You combine all that, there is no doubt that the economy is weaker now than it was at the beginning of the year. And every independent economist who has looked at this question carefully believes that for us to make sure that we are taking out an insurance policy against a possible double-dip recession, it is important for us to make sure that we are boosting consumer confidence, putting money into their pockets, cutting taxes where we can for small businesses, and that it makes sense for us to put people back to work doing the work that needs to be done. That's exactly what this jobs bill does.Now, with respect to working with Congress, I think it's fair to say that I have gone out of my way in every instance, sometimes at my own political peril and to the frustration of Democrats, to work with Republicans to find common ground to move this country forward, in every instance, whether it was during the lame duck session, when we were able to get an agreement on making sure that the payroll tax was cut in the first place and making sure that unemployment insurance was extended, to my constant efforts during the debt ceiling to try to get what's been called a grand bargain in which we had a balanced approach to actually bringing down our deficit and debt in a way that wouldn't hurt our recovery.Each time, what we've seen is games-playing, a preference to try to score political points rather than actually get something done on the part of the other side. And that has been true not just over the last 6 months; that's been true over the last 2½ years.Now, the bottom line is this: Our doors are open. And what I've done over the last several weeks is to take the case to the American people so that they understand what's at stake. It is now up to all the Senators and, hopefully, all the Members of the House to explain to their constituencies why they would be opposed to commonsense ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past. Why would you be opposed to tax cuts for small businesses and tax cuts for American workers?My understanding is that for the last decade, they've been saying we need to lower taxes for folks. Well, why wouldn't we want to do that through this jobs bill? We know that we've got roads and bridges and schools that need to be rebuilt. And historically, Republicans haven't been opposed to rebuilding roads and bridges. Why would you be opposed now?We know that the biggest problem that we've had in terms of unemployment over the last several months has not been in the private sector, it's actually been layoffs of teachers and cops and firefighters. We've created over 2 million jobs in the private sector--a million jobs this year alone in the private sector--but in the public sector, we keep on seeing these layoffs having an adverse effect on economies in States all across the country. Why wouldn't we want to make sure that those teachers are in the classroom teaching our kids?So here's the bottom line: My expectation and hope is that everybody will vote for this jobs bill because it reflects those ideas that traditionally have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. If it turns out that there are Republicans who are opposed to this bill, they need to explain to me, but more importantly, to their constituencies and the American people, why they're opposed and what would they do.We know that this jobs bill, based on independent analysis, could grow the economy almost an additional 2 percent. That could mean an additional 1.9 million jobs. Do they have a plan that would have a similar impact? Because if they do, I'm happy to hear it. But I haven't heard them offer alternatives that would have that same kind of impact, and that's what we need right now.A lot of the problems that this economy is facing are problems that predate the financial crisis: middle class families seeing their wages and their incomes flat despite rising costs for everything from health care to a college education. And so folks have been struggling not just for the last 3 years, they've been struggling for over a decade now. And at a time when so many people are having such a hard time, we have to have an approach, we have to take action, that is big enough to meet the moment. And what I've heard from Republicans is, well, we're agreeing to do these trade bills. That's great. I'm in favor of those trade bills, and I'm glad they're passing, but that's not going to do enough to deal with the huge problems we have right now with respect to unemployment.We passed patent legislation. That was bipartisan work. I'm thrilled that I was--we were able to get Republicans and Democrats to work together on that. But that is a long-term issue for our economic competitiveness. It's not putting Americans to work right now.So the bottom line is this, Ben: If next week Senators have additional ideas that will put people back to work right now and meet the challenges of the current economy, we are happy to consider them. But every idea that we put forward are ones that traditionally have been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. And I think it's important for us to have a vote on those ideas, because I believe that it's very hard to argue against them.And if Mr. McConnell chooses to vote against it or if members of his caucus choose to vote against it, I promise you we're going to keep on going and we will put forward maybe piece by piece each component of the bill. And each time they're going to have to explain why it is that they'd be opposed to putting teachers back in the classroom or rebuilding our schools or giving tax cuts to middle class folks and giving tax cuts to small businesses.", "label": "Implicit"}

You don't win those battles by being a fair-weather friend to your ally. You don't win those battles by being hesitant or withdrawing support for each other when the going gets tough. You don't win those battles by losing the will to fight if your enemy's will to fight is very strong and very powerful.And actually, the values that we represent, as two countries, are shown by what we—what we've been through today. I mean, the President gets tough questions from the American press corps; I get, I like to say, even tougher questions—[]—or at least as tough questions in the British press corps. And—— If you want to define them as tough. [] And we can—here as we speak at this press conference, I mean, I can't make out the words that they're shouting over there, but I bet they're not totally complimentary to either of us. [] Wait a minute. I don't know about that. [] I mean, it could be the supporters we brought in, but I've got a feeling the likelihood is, no. [] And that's what it's about. It's about democracy, and it's about people being free to express their views, and it's about politicians having to face the pressure to justify their decisions, to be punished if the people don't like those decisions. And it's a commonality of values that we have that is so important for the world today.And so you know, yes, of course, it's like—anybody who's sitting there advising a politician in any part of Europe today, if you want to get the easiest round of applause, get up and attack America. You can get a round of applause if you attack the President. You get a—— Standing ovation. [] Yes. And that's fine if everyone wants to do that, but when all of that is cleared away, you're left with something very, very simple, fundamental, and clear, that that battle for values is still going on.And you can debate about the mistakes and the issues, and you can debate about Iraq, whether we should have done this, or we should have done that. But actually, what is happening in Iraq today is that our enemy is fighting us, and, therefore, if what happens when our enemy fights us is that we drift away from our friends, that we kind of make the little accommodations so that we don't escape some of the difficulty and the responsibility and, occasionally, opprobrium of decisionmaking, if we do that, our enemy takes heart from that; they watch that. They watch what we're doing the whole time. They ask, Are these guys standing up for what they believe, or if we carry on, is their will going to diminish and they're going to give up because it's just too difficult, because the public opinion is too difficult, because the opinion polls tell them it's too difficult?Now, that is the decision of leadership. And it's not just a decision for me and him; it's a decision for everybody who's engaged in politics. And people run down politics and say it's all just a series of positions and attitudes and sound bites and, occasionally, even lies and all the rest of it. Actually, what politics is in the end, when it's done in the right way, when people stand up for what they believe, is, it's about public service. And there's nothing to be ashamed of in that. And the fact is, the decisions are difficult; of course, they're difficult.And we took a decision that we thought was very difficult. I thought then and I think now, it was the right decision. History will make a judgment at a particular time.

It's a better way of life, and it's the way of life, actually, people, any time they are given the choice, choose to have.

And Michelle and I, we always have our—the Olympic team here. And it's a lot of fun, first of all, just because anytime you're meeting somebody who is the best at anything—[]—it's impressive. And these mostly very young people are all just so healthy looking, and they just beam and exude fitness and health. And so we have a great time talking to them.But they are of all shapes, sizes, colors: the genetic diversity that is on display is remarkable. And if you look at a Simone Biles, and then you look at a Michael Phelps, they're completely different. And it's precisely because of those differences that we've got people here who can excel at any sport.And by the way, more than half of our medals came from women. And the reason is, is because we had the foresight several decades ago, with something called Title IX, to make sure that women got opportunities in sports, which is why our women compete better, because they have more opportunities than folks in other countries.So I use that as a metaphor. And if in fact we continue to keep opportunity open to everybody, then, yes, we're going to have a woman President, we're going to have a Latino President, and we'll have a Jewish President, a Hindu President. Who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed-up Presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them. [] And that's fine.Now, what do I worry about? I obviously spent a lot of time on this, April, at my Farewell Address on Tuesday, so I won't go through the whole list. I worry about inequality, because I think that if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast, and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans, and I—not just along racial lines. I mean, there are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the President-elect because they feel forgotten and disenfranchised. They feel as if they're being looked down on. They feel as if their kids aren't going to have the same opportunities as they did.And you don't want to have an America in which a handful—a very small sliver of people are doing really well and everybody else is fighting for scraps, as I said last week. Because that's oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified, because people think, well, the only way I'm going to get ahead is if I make sure somebody else gets less, somebody who doesn't look like me or doesn't worship at the same place I do. That's not a good recipe for our democracy.I worry about, as I said in response to a previous question, making sure that the basic machinery of our democracy works better. We are the only country in the advanced world that makes it harder to vote rather than easier. And that dates back; there's an ugly history to that that we should not be shy about talking about.", "label": "Explicit"}

Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here? [SEP] Let's be clear, Chelsea Manning served a substantial prison term. It's not as if there were no consequences. My view is that she went through the trial process, accepted responsibility, and her sentence was disproportionate compared to others. She served significant time, so commuting her sentence was appropriate. I believe justice was served, and a message was sent about national security. Those with concerns should use established channels and whistleblower protections. I recognize some feel those aren't enough, but national security involves people in the field whose lives are at risk. As for WikiLeaks, I haven't commented generally. The intelligence community's conclusions on Russian hacking and WikiLeaks' involvement were inconclusive. I don't follow Assange's tweets. Refer to the Justice Department on criminal investigations. In this cyber age, we must balance accountability, openness, and transparency with the need to protect ourselves from adversaries.

And all of the sudden, those things started to disappear at the end, after they were fully negotiated.But that's—you know, that's their decision. I think if they had to do again—and in light of the fact that we have 25 percent on $250 billion of goods coming into the United States. And unlike a lot of countries, they subsidize those goods. We haven't had inflation. And you know, they keep saying that the American taxpayer is paying for it. No. No. Very little.And what it really does mean is that a lot of those companies that are in China are going to be moving back to the U.S. You have car companies—General Motors, as an example—that built plants in China. Well, that doesn't work out too well when you have the tariff wall up because now they're going to have to get through that and they can't really get through that. So maybe they'll start building plants in the United States instead.I think that we'll end up making a deal with China. We have a very good relationship, although it's a little bit testy right now, as you would expect. I think they really have to make a deal. A lot of companies are leaving China, as you know. It's in all the reports. And they're going to Vietnam and various other places, and they're also coming to the United States to make their product because they don't want to pay the tariff.And there is no tariff if you do it in the United States. People don't realize that. You know, they say the tariff, but there is no tariff if you don't do it—you know, if you just do exactly as I say: You bring your company back to the United States.And as far as Mexico is concerned, which was a very big topic yesterday—and now people are finding out that the reports that were written were totally false—we would never have had a deal with Mexico without imposing tariffs.

That was not anticipated. But regardless, I mean, you knew enough of what it said. And I didn't do it on purpose, but we have a lot of strength in 45 days if we decide to use that strength. Maybe we will, and maybe we won't.

What rules is China not playing by? What specific steps do you need to see from China? And what punitive actions is your administration willing to take, as you said it would yesterday, if China does not play by the rules? [SEP] Well, first of all, I also said yesterday that we welcome the peaceful rise of . It is in America's interests to see succeed in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. can be a source of stability and help to underwrite international norms and codes of conduct.And so what we've done over the last 2 years is to try to develop a frank, consistent, open relationship and dialogue with , and it's yielded considerable benefits, for example, support for issues like . But what I've also said to Chinese leadership since I came into office is that when it comes to their economic practices, there are a range of things that they have done that disadvantage not just the United States, but a whole host of their trading partners and countries in the region.The most famous example is the issue of 's currency. Most economists estimate that the RMB is devalued by 20 to 25 percent. That means our exports to are that much more expensive and their imports into the United States are that much cheaper. Now, there's been slight improvement over the last year, partly because of U.S. pressure, but it hasn't been enough. And it's time for them to go ahead and move towards a market-based system for their currency.Now, we recognize they may not be able to do it overnight, but they can do it much more quickly than they've done it so far. And by the way, that would not necessarily be a bad thing for the Chinese economy, because they've been so focused on export-driven growth that they've neglected domestic consumption, building up domestic markets. It makes them much more vulnerable to shocks in the global economy. It throws the whole world economy out of balance because they're not buying as much as they could be from other countries.And this is not something that's inconsistent with where Chinese leadership say they want to go. The problem is, is that you've got a bunch of export producers in who like the system as it is and making changes are difficult for them politically. I get it. But the United States and other countries, I think understandably, feel that enough's enough.That's not the only concern we have. Intellectual property rights and protections--companies that do business in consistently report problems in terms of intellectual property not being protected. Now, that's particularly important for an advanced economy like ours, where that's one of our competitive advantages, is we've got great engineers, great entrepreneurs, we're designing extraordinary new products. And if they get no protection, and the next thing you know, 's operating as a low-cost producer and not paying any fees or revenues to folks who invented these products, that's a problem.So those are two examples, but there are a number of others. These practices aren't secret. I think everybody understands that they've been going on for quite some time. Sometimes, American companies are wary about bringing them up because they don't want to be punished in terms of their ability to do business in . But I don't have that same concern, so I bring it up.And in terms of enforcement, the other thing that we've been doing is actually trying to enforce the trade laws that are in place. We've brought a number of cases. One that the U.S. press may be familiar with are the cases involving U.S. tires, where we brought very aggressive actions against and won. And as a consequence, U.S. producers are in a better position, and that means more U.S. jobs.So I think we can benefit from trade with . And I want certainly to continue cultivating a constructive relationship with the Chinese Government, but we're going to continue to be firm in insisting that they operate by the same rules that everybody else operates under.

So they choke sometimes, and that goes on the evening news for weeks.And the thousands and tens of thousands of great things they do, nobody covers that. Nobody writes about that. But if they make a mistake——And again, the bad cops—everybody agrees they have to be very tough on bad cops. But sometimes you have a cop or a police person who is a good—a good police person, right?

[SEP] First, get me the contact information for that family. I want to personally assure them of our support. As President, I proudly ended the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, signed the Respect for Marriage Act, and strengthened civil rights protections for the LGBT community. However, we face opposition from prejudiced individuals who are spreading fear and division. It is unacceptable for someone to be fired for their sexual orientation or to face violence and hate crimes. We must protect transgender children from hateful bills and ensure their well-being. These are our children, and we must stand by them. I am announcing new initiatives to safeguard the LGBT community, including strengthening physical safety, addressing civil rights violations, and providing mental health support. Congress must pass the Equality Act. To all LGBTQ Americans, especially children, know that you are loved, heard, and supported by this administration.

But let me put it this way: the problems we're facing are so big that no single thing we do is going to be a silver bullet. As I've said many times, not everything we try is going to work out perfectly. This is new territory. While there's a general agreement among economists on how to move forward, the need for a big recovery package, and a mix of tax cuts and investment, even if we do everything right, we still have to fix the financial system, get banks lending again, deal with housing, and build a new regulatory system to prevent future crises.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, you've spoken about the need for banks to lend, their creativity in pursuing profit, and your ability to stop them from profiting excessively. How will you prevent them from charging these fees, and does the government have the right to dictate corporate profits? [SEP] I certainly don't believe that. I was trying to illustrate that financial regulation is often used as a pretext to charge consumers more. They claim that if one hidden fee is prohibited, they'll simply invent another to compensate. They're entitled to do that, but it's not a desirable practice and isn't necessarily fair to consumers. My primary objective is to establish a consumer watchdog that informs consumers about fair practices, ensures transparent transactions, and fosters competition among banks based on service quality and reasonable prices. The frustrating aspect is that some members of Congress, particularly Republicans, advocate for the removal of all restrictions on financial companies. This is a source of frustration for the American people, who have experienced hidden fees, unexpected rate increases, and incomprehensible fine print on credit cards and mortgages, contributing to overall economic weakness. Yes, I believe it's entirely appropriate for the government to have some oversight role to ensure consumer protection. Banks, like any business in America, can price their products as they see fit. That's how the free market operates, provided there's transparency and accountability, and consumers understand what they're getting. And there will be instances where a policy judgment is made that certain practices are simply unfair. That's how the market has always functioned.", "label": "General"}

We have a real chance to lock in economic and political security for the long haul. This isn't about him; it's about the bigger picture, the ongoing struggle between democracies and autocracies.

On the debt ceiling, your Treasury Secretary has estimated that the U.S. Government will lose its ability to pay its bills come late February or early March. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has said the Republicans are going to decide what it is they can accomplish on this debt limit fight—his words. Will you negotiate with House Republicans on the debt ceiling? [SEP] Oh, Brianna, you know the answer to this question. No, we're not going to negotiate for Congress to pay bills that it has accrued.Here's the good news: I want to emphasize the positive as we enter into this holiday season. I think Congressman Ryan and Senator Murray did a good job in trying to narrow the differences and actually pass a \\budget that I can sign. It's not everything that I would like, obviously. It buys back part of these across-the-board cuts, the so-called sequester, but not all of them. So we're still underfunding research, we're still underfunding education, we're still underfunding transportation and other initiatives that would create jobs right now.But it was an honest conversation. They operated in good faith. And given how far apart the parties have been on fiscal issues, they should take pride in what they did. And I actually called them after they struck the deal, and I have said congratulations, and I hope that creates a good pattern for next year, where we work on at least the things we agree to, even if we agree to disagree on some of the other big-ticket items.I think immigration potentially falls in that category, where let's—here's an area where we've got bipartisan agreement. There are a few differences here and there, but the truth of the matter is, is that the Senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skilled workers who are doing great things in places like Silicon Valley and around the country. So let's go ahead and get that done.Now, I can't imagine that having seen this possible daylight breaking when it comes to cooperation in Congress that folks are thinking actually about plunging us back into the kinds of brinksmanship and governance by crisis that has done us so much harm over the last couple of years.To repeat: The debt ceiling is raised simply to pay bills that we have already accrued. It is not something that is a negotiating tool. It's not leverage. It's the responsibility of Congress. It's part of doing their job. I expect them to do their job. Although I'm happy to talk to them about any of the issues that they actually want to get done. So if Congressman Ryan is interested in tax reform, let's go. I've got some proposals on it. If he's interested in any issue out there, I'm willing to have a constructive conversation of the sort that we just had in resolving the budget issues.

Our priority is neutralizing Libyan air defenses for the no-fly zone and coalition aircraft safety. We're also focused on humanitarian aid. We anticipate this transition in a matter of days, not weeks. The Pentagon will update the public and press. NATO will play a coordinating role. Admiral Mullen can detail the transfer process.

[SEP] Let's remember why we went to Afghanistan. 3,000 Americans were murdered by terrorists operating openly there. It was right to go after that organization and the government that allowed it. Our troops and Afghan allies achieved our main goal: to weaken Al Qaida so they can't attack us again. Everything we've done has focused on that. We'll be able to say our sacrifices achieved that goal. We also wanted a stable, sovereign Afghanistan, a responsible partner. That required Afghanistan to have its own security and be on a path to prosperity and peace. Afghanistan still has work to do, but the possibility of peace and prosperity is higher now than before we went in. That's partly because of American sacrifices. Did we achieve everything we imagined? Probably not. It's a human endeavor. Did we achieve our main goal?

Sir, you can't legislate and you can't Executive order out the issue of empathy or the lack thereof in the midst of this rhetoric—this heated political rhetoric. What's next? [SEP] Part of what I think leadership requires—and I hope I meet this standard—is letting people know you understand their problem. Again, my dad used to have an expression. He said, I don't expect the Government to solve my problems, but I expect them to at least know what they are, understand them.And like a lot of you, we've been very fortunate as a family, but we've also been through a lot of fairly tough times. And it's not—and I've had the great advantage of having a family to get through them.When my first wife and daughter were killed when a tractor trailer broadsided them and killed my wife and—killed my first wife and killed my daughter, and my two boys were expected to die; they were in the—it took the jaws of life 3 hours to get them out. They were on top of their dead mother and dead sister. I understand what that pain is like.And when Jill and I lost Beau after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star and Conspicuous Service Medal, a major in the United States military, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma because he lived about 200—between 2- and 500 yards from burn pit that's 10 feet deep and as big as a football field, burning every toxic waste you could find.You know, I think that we understand what it's like to lose family members, mothers, fathers, to cancer—all of you have been through that kind of thing. We've been fortunate though. We've had each other. We've had strong families—Jill's sisters, my brothers, my sister.And so what we can do to deal with that empathy is make sure there's help available, make sure there's people who are there to help—whether they are a psychologist or whether they're medical doctors or whether they're social workers—to be there to help, to help just hold a hand.And, for example, we can do an awful lot for a lot of families, the families you're talking about, if we—reinstate this child tax credit. It cut child poverty by 40 percent when it was in place. I couldn't get it passed the second time around.So there's a lot we can do. And the empathy is not just talking about it, it's communicating to people you genuinely understand. And I hope a lot of people don't understand, because they—I don't want people having to know the pain.But the second piece of that is, let them know that you are there to help. You're there to help.And one of the things I've talked with Vivek Murthy about—and a lot of you have written about it, and you've written it well about it—is the need for mental health care in America. You know, when we got elected, there were something like, I don't know, 2-, 3-, 5 million people who had gotten their COVID shots.Well, in the meantime—I've got over 220 million people all three shots. But in the meantime, what happened? We lost over a million dead. A million dead.I read one study that for those million people, they had nine people who were—each one of them had, on average, nine people close to them. A relative, someone they're married to, a child—someone close.The impact has been profound. It's been profound. Think of all the people—think of all your children and your grandchildren who didn't have that senior prom, who didn't have that graduation party, who didn't have all the things we had that we took for granted, that impact on their psyche.So there's a lot we have to do. And empathy reflects itself not just on what a person demonstrates they understand—of knowing what people need and helping to make it happen. And we're trying to do that. And a lot of Republicans are trying to do it too. I don't mean this as a partisan thing. A lot of people are trying to do it because they know we've got a problem.Okay, excuse me.

Of course, the coronavirus has presented challenges. Our focus is on high-risk individuals and frontline workers. We have established thousands of distribution centers, specifically targeting minority and low-income areas. Prioritizing testing at Historically Black Colleges and Universities is also a key objective. It's disheartening to see some individuals attempting to instill fear about the vaccine. It is safe, effective, and essential for everyone, especially those at higher risk, to receive it. This negativity emerged when it appeared we might have a vaccine before the election. It's purely political, driven by disinformation. Similar to the fabricated football ad or the misleading story about me. They are criticizing the vaccine out of fear. However, we are nearing a breakthrough, with massive distribution planned within weeks, prioritizing seniors. We are conducting extensive testing at HBCUs, an initiative I proposed.

As for immigration, Holder and Johnson are working on recommendations, and I'll get to them. My preference is still for Congress to act, but they've been sitting on their hands.

Sustaining economic growth and ensuring quality education for our children are also paramount. With the shift in Congress, bipartisan collaboration is essential for legislative progress. Expect increased engagement and dialogue with Democrats, as they now control committees and dictate bill flow. The Iraq War undeniably influenced the election, especially amid televised images of conflict. Surprisingly, despite a robust economy, which often dictates off-year elections, a different sentiment prevailed among voters. The positive economic indicators were overshadowed by the challenges of the war. I recognize that some disagree with my decisions, but I will continue to act in the best interests of the country. I have never prioritized short-term popularity over my principles or decisions. I understand the public's frustration, which I share, wishing for a swifter resolution. Secretary Rumsfeld echoes this sentiment. However, this is a difficult struggle, and we will prevail. Our only path to failure is premature withdrawal. Yes, Jim.", "label": "Implicit"}

No one at this conference has questioned my commitment. They're focused on our actions regarding deforestation and Build Back Better. World leaders are now prioritizing climate impact in infrastructure projects. There's a legitimate reason to be worried, but I'm optimistic because public opinion has shifted significantly since COP25. People are experiencing unprecedented climate events firsthand.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. President Bush, your decision to sign legislation authorizing construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border was not viewed positively here in the region. How would you respond to critics who feel that that sent a message that Latin Americans are not welcome in the United States?And, President Berger, what are your thoughts on the idea of a fence, the U.S. border policy in regard to a fence? [SEP] I did sign legislation modernizing our border. It was more than just fence; it was infrastructure—kind of a novel infrastructure, like detection devices, berms. We've got a very long border, and it needs to be enforced. It needs to be enforced not only to stop s, but it needs to be enforced to stop drugs. It needs to be enforced to stop potential terrorists, and it needs to be enforced to stop arms—by the way, arms that sometimes go the other way—I'm told. And so we've got to have border. That's what countries do; they enforce their borders.And so we modernized the border. It was more than just fence. And I understand it sent a signal that said, you're not welcome. Quite the contrary: People are welcome, but under the law. There are thousands of people in our country who are not citizens who are there legally. The question is, what do we do with people who have been there over years, the result of a law that isn't working well? And I've already given that answer.I will also explain that part of convincing people that a comprehensive plan can work is to assure the American people that we're doing our duty by enforcing law. In other words, a lot of citizens said, You just don't care about whether or not we have a border that's secure. And the Congress responded by saying, Of course, we care. It is the first step toward a comprehensive bill. In other words, people in Congress were saying, Let us do something about border enforcement, and then let's go comprehensive. I hope that's what they're saying.In other words, that's what I'm pressing them to say. Okay, we've responded to the needs of border enforcement; there are people being sent back. As a matter of fact, I think it's interesting—and frankly, I didn't anticipate this—that the good press corps of Guatemala, reflecting the concerns of the Guatemalan people, and the President of Guatemala reflecting the concerns, asked me about deportations. I mean, that was a primary concern. It means that something is—the law is being enforced, is what that means.The American people need to be persuaded, Elaine, that the Government takes our responsibilities seriously, which then will make it easier to convince reluctant Members of Congress to come up with a comprehensive plan.Now, I've always been for a comprehensive plan. You might remember, if you look back at some of my speeches—I know you didn't listen to any of them, but you might want to go back and read them. [] Well, that's not fair. Okay, anyway, but I've always felt it was important. And I learned firsthand how important it was as the Governor of Texas. I used to say, family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River and that people are coming to do jobs Americans are not doing because they want to feed their families. That's why I said that.By the way, the reason why trade is important in helping the programs like Labradores Mayas is that I also believe most citizens in Guatemala would rather find meaningful jobs at home instead of having to travel to a foreign land to work. And therefore, the more we can enhance prosperity in our neighborhood, the more we can encourage trade that actually yields jobs and stability, the less likely it is somebody who is worried about putting food on the table for their family will be coming to the United States.Anyway, I thank you for your interest on the topic, Mr. President. It's been a wonderful press conference. Thank you. I would like to close with that topic: the American Dream for everyone. And we can have that American Dream in our own countries by promoting education, by improving infrastructure, by implementing CAFTA, which is a very interesting tool to produce and to export and also to attract investment and generate jobs. I would believe that we are firm along those lines and that the American Dream is going to be the dream for all the Americans living in the American Continent.Thank you very much.

We need to change that dynamic. People need to vote for candidates who support gun safety, even if they're good on other issues.

But when it comes to the top 2 percent, what I'm not going to do is to extend further a tax cut for folks who don't need it, which would cost close to a trillion dollars.And it's very difficult to see how you make up that trillion dollars—if we're serious about deficit reduction—just by closing loopholes and deductions. The math tends not to work. And I think it's important to establish a basic principle that was debated extensively during the course of this campaign. I mean, this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. This was—if there was one thing that everybody understood was a big difference between myself and Mr. Romney, it was, when it comes to how we reduce our deficit, I argued for a balanced, responsible approach, and part of that included making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay a little bit more.I think every voter out there understood that that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me. Not—by the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me. So we've got a clear majority of the American people who recognize if we're going to be serious about deficit reduction, we've got to do it in a balanced way.The only question now is, are we going to hold the middle class hostage in order to go ahead and let that happen? Or can we all step back and say, Here's something we agree on, we don't want middle class taxes to go up? Let's go ahead and lock that in. That will be good for the economy. It will be good for consumers. It will be good for businesses. It takes the edge off the fiscal cliff. And let's also then commit ourselves to the broader package of deficit reduction that includes entitlement changes, and it includes potentially tax reform as well, as I'm willing to look at additional work that we can do on the discretionary spending side.So I want a big deal. I want a comprehensive deal. I want to see if we can, at least for the foreseeable future, provide certainty to businesses and the American people so that we can focus on job growth, so that we're also investing in the things that we need.

But let's be clear, the current agreement is inherently unfair. I've made this point to Prime Minister Abe repeatedly over the past half-year. Consider this: an attack on Japan triggers our full military response, a complete commitment to their defense. Yet, an attack on the United States doesn't obligate them to reciprocate in the same manner. That's a lopsided deal. It's symptomatic of the kind of agreements we've been saddled with.

{"sentence": "Q. What choice do you think the American people made last week? And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices? [SEP] I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it's interconnected, that you're not going to put that genie back in the bottle. The American people recognize that their careers or their kids' careers are going to have to be more dynamic, that they might not be working at a single plant for 30 years, but they might have to change careers. They might have to get more education. They might have to retool or retrain.And I think the American people are game for that. They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair. And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans' attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade. But they're concerned about whether or not trade is fair and whether we've got the same access to other countries' markets as they have with us. Is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages and so forth?Now, I made an argumentthus far, unsuccessfullythat the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that: that it strengthened workers' rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field, and as a consequence, would be good for American workers and American businesses. But that's a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored.So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described. And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair, I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign. As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy. It keeps this country young. It keeps it dynamic. We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks. And that's part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful. It's part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we've got a younger population that's more dynamic.When it comes to trade, I think when you're governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you've got a global supply chain. The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they're bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico. And so it's not as simple as it might have seemed.And the key for uswhen I say us, I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressivesis to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, here's how we fix them: higher minimum wage; stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie; stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones; yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren't engaging in child labor, for example; being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks in communities that feel forgotten.That's going to be our most important strategy. And I think we can successfully do that. People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight. And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past.Martha Raddatz [ABC News].", "label": "Deflection"}

And the other economic problems facing people—beyond your concern that you stated here and your expectations for these stimulus checks, what kind of hope can you offer to people who are in dire straits?

You just said the price of gasoline may be up to $4 a gallon—or some expert told you that—and that creates a lot of uncertainty. If you're out there wondering whether or not—you know, what your life is going to be like and you're looking at $4 a gallon, that's uncertain. And when you couple that with the idea that your taxes may be going up in a couple of years, that's double uncertainty. And therefore, one way to deal with uncertainty is for Congress to make the tax cuts permanent.Secondly, it's—people got to understand that our energy policies needs to be focused on a lot of things: one, renewables, which is fine, which I strongly support, as you know; two, conservation. But we need to be finding more oil and gas at home if we're worried about becoming independent—dependent on oil overseas. And this—I view it as a transitory period to new technologies that'll change the way we live. But we haven't built a refinery in a long time. We're expanding refineries, but we haven't built a refinery in a long time. I strongly suggested to the Congress that we build refineries on old military bases, but no, it didn't pass. But if you've got less supply of something as demand continues to stay steady or grow, your price is going to go up.Secondly, on oil, we—the more oil we find at home, the better off we're going to be in terms of the short run. And yet our policy is, you know, let us not explore robustly in places like ANWR. And there are environmental concerns, and I understand that. I also know there's technologies that should mitigate these environmental concerns.They got a bill up there in Congress now. Their attitude is, let's tax oil companies. Well, all that's going to do is make the price even higher. We ought to be encouraging investment in oil and gas close to home if we're trying to mitigate the problems we face right now.And so yes, there's a lot of uncertainty, and I'm concerned about the uncertainty. Hopefully, this progrowth package will help—this 100—I think it's $147 billion that will be going out the door, starting electronically in the first week of May and through check in the second week of May.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, can you address the congressional delays with the TPP and the implications of Mullah Mansur's killing? [SEP] Now, regarding the TPP, trade agreements are always a tough sell. Everyone wants a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. And during an election year, you can expect some political grandstanding. However, I remain optimistic that we will get it done. It's the right thing to do. It benefits America, the region, and the world. This is the fastest-growing area globally, representing a significant market for the United States. Many countries already sell their products to us with relatively low tariffs, while our goods face higher tariffs there. This agreement eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods, which is a positive for American businesses and workers. One of the main concerns about trade deals has been the exposure to countries with lower wages and weaker labor and environmental standards. TPP addresses this by including enforceable commitments to improve labor standards and address environmental issues. I have yet to see a convincing argument that TPP will make us worse off. We are demonstrably better off. The political process will be challenging, as it was with the Korean and Colombian free trade agreements. But we successfully navigated those, and I am confident we will do the same here. Regarding currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that enhance transparency and reporting to monitor potential manipulation. There has been debate about enforceable provisions to impose tariffs if currency values drop too much. However, it is difficult to determine the cause of currency devaluation and whether it is actually being manipulated. Moreover, binding other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would require us to bind our Federal Reserve, which we are not willing to do. However, we have strengthened provisions to put countries on notice if we believe they are engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, concerning the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansur, his death has been confirmed. As the head of the Taliban, he was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops in Afghanistan. This does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not re-entering combat operations. Our role is to assist Afghanistan in securing its own country. However, when a high-profile leader consistently plans to harm U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, I have a responsibility as Commander in Chief to ensure that we protect our people.

The key is helping the Iraqi government build a security force capable of stopping the ethnic cleansing we saw in certain areas. There's also plain old criminality to deal with. And yes, al-Qaeda is present, responsible for some of the most horrific attacks. Zarqawi, that foreign terrorist, openly aimed to ignite sectarian violence through bombings, and he succeeded to a degree.

And then on supply chain, sir: One of the, obviously, big problems in the United States for supply chains is not having enough workers, not enough people to drive trucks to unload at ports, for example, and a lot of other parts in the supply chain. Workers have not returned to the labor force in America as fast as your administration thought they would. Why do you think that is? Why aren't people coming back to work? [SEP] Because they're able to negotiate for higher wages, and they move from one job to another. That's one of the reasons why. A lot of people don't want to continue to do the job they did before, making 7, 8, 9 bucks an hour. An awful lot of the auto—excuse me, of the truck drivers are not unionized truck drivers. They're working like hell and not getting paid a whole lot.And so what you're seeing here is a combination of the desire of people to be able to change professions, to be able to do more and take care of their families, and at the same time, dealing with the issue that, in fact, we are short of workers.But worker pay has actually gone up.

They were tasked with evaluating our security structures and programs to ensure they balance security needs with rule of law and privacy concerns. I'll make a definitive statement in January after consulting with various stakeholders. The 215 program, involving bulk metadata collection, has drawn attention. The NSA believed it was crucial for tracking potential terrorist threats. While there haven't been allegations of misuse, public concern exists. We need to determine if we can achieve the same goals with greater public confidence. I'm confident the NSA isn't engaging in domestic surveillance, but we must adapt to changing technologies.

And on the Middle East, what specific steps will you take if Netanyahu refuses to extend the settlement moratorium, jeopardizing peace negotiations? [SEP] Alright, let's address Afghanistan first. We're engaged in a challenging but vital mission there. Let's not forget why we're there – 9/11. Our objective is to dismantle Al Qaeda and prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a launchpad for attacks against the United States again. Now, Afghanistan faces significant challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, ethnic divisions, and a history of weak governance. Our strategy involves training Afghan security forces, fostering a political settlement in the region, promoting a government that serves its people, and combating corruption. We've made some headway on corruption, with increased indictments of corrupt officials. However, there's still much work to be done. I consistently emphasize to President Karzai the importance of serving the Afghan people and reducing corruption for long-term stability. We'll continue to exert pressure on this front. While progress may not be immediate, we're vigilant about potential compromises with corrupt individuals and are constantly reviewing our actions to ensure consistency. Regarding the Middle East, the settlement moratorium is a key issue. Despite initial skepticism, it has significantly reduced settlement construction. I've urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to extend the moratorium if talks continue constructively. Ultimately, the goal is for both sides to agree on borders, allowing Israel to build in undisputed areas. I recognize the political challenges Netanyahu faces, and I've encouraged President Abbas to demonstrate seriousness in negotiations to ease Netanyahu's position.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the intelligence community's assessment of a civil war in Iraq, your emphasis on victory, and the potential for attacks here at home, how do you justify maintaining a 'non-open-ended' commitment?

We're talking about a place with *some* peace, not total peace, because let's face it, no car bombs ever? That's a pipe dream. The big question is, can we help the Iraqi government get enough security to stop the ethnic cleansing we saw? Plus, there's just plain crime. And yeah, al-Qaeda's there, doing some nasty bombings. Zarqawi, that foreign dirtbag, was all about starting a sectarian war with bombs, and he did a pretty good job. Then you've got the Sunnis who are ticked off because they're not in charge anymore, even though they're not the majority. They're ready to make trouble to get back on top. So, whatever you want to call it, it's a mess, and Iraq needs to sort it out. Some say civil war, some don't. But it's bad enough that I had to step in. We want a government that follows the rules, a country where people feel safe, where everyone gets a fair share of the pie, where the provinces have some say, where people who aren't criminals can get involved in politics, and where Iraq is on our side against the terrorists – a place for regular folks, not crazy extremists.

It's a complex situation, given the country's poverty and divisions. We're focused on building Afghan security capacity, promoting a political solution, and encouraging effective governance.

Ghana is a great place to see this firsthand. Africa has changed positively since I became President, thanks to African leaders. Conflict resolution has improved, like in Liberia. The U.S. has been a useful partner, not imposing our will. Democracy is progressing, with examples like John Kufuor.

They're not even close, and they won't be close as long as somebody smart is right here, they won't be close.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. Yesterday the President of Brazil was talking about the importance not only of growing the economic pie, but making sure that it's divided more equitably. I wonder how you think that applies within the United States, where the idea of spreading the wealth around isn't always warmly greeted, and how, for example, with this free trade agreement, you make sure that the benefits are widely shared. And if I may, sir, on an unrelated topic, if I could get your reaction to the Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments that the P-5-plus-1 had given Iran a freebie with this additional time.And for President Santos, what responsibility do you believe the countries of Latin America, especially those that have become more democratic, have for helping to bring Cuba into the democratic fold? [SEP] The goal of any government should be to create security for its citizens and to give them opportunity to achieve prosperity and to pass that prosperity on to their kids. And I'm a strong believer that the free market is the best tool ever invented to create wealth.But what's true in every country is that we always have to think about whether every single person is getting a fair shot, where they actually have opportunity. Is everybody doing their fair share to support the common efforts that are required to create a platform for growth? Is everybody playing by the same set of rules? And I think the history of the United States, the reason we became an economic superpower is because--not always perfectly, not always consistently, but better than any other country on Earth--we were able to give opportunity to everybody. That's what the American Dream was all about.So when we have debates now about our tax policy, when we have debates now about the Buffett rule that we've been talking about, where we say if you make a million dollars a year or more you shouldn't pay a lower tax rate than your secretary, that is not an argument about redistribution. That is an argument about growth. Because the history of the United States is we grow best when our growth is broad-based. We grow best when our middle class is strong. We grow best when everybody has opportunity. And that means that somebody who has a great idea and is selling a great product or service, we want them to get rich. That's great. But we also want to make sure that we as a society are investing in that young kid who comes from a poor family, who has incredible talent and might be able to get rich as well.And that means we've got to build good schools, and we've got to make sure that that child can go to college. And we also want to make sure that we keep our scientific edge, and that means we've got to invest in basic research. And that means that we've got to have some basic safety net, because people are more willing to take risks that are required for the free market to work if they know that if they fall on hardship, if something happens, that there's still some floor that they can't fall beneath and that they'll be able to retire with some dignity and some respect.And so one of the things that we're going to be talking about over the next several months as we debate the budget and Government spending and the proper role of Government, is just--I want everybody to remember, I'm going to say this repeatedly--this is not an argument about taking from A to give to B. This is not a redistributionist argument that we're making. We're making an argument about how do we grow the economy so that it's going to be prospering in this competitive 21st-century environment. And the only way we're going to do that is if people like me, who have been incredibly blessed, are willing to give a little bit back so that the next generation coming along can succeed as well. And the more people that succeed, the better off the country is going to be.With respect to the Iranian talks, I've been very clear on this. Iran has violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. They're the only country that's a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, that cannot convince the international community that they are abiding by the rules governing the NPT. And not just the United States, but the world community is now imposing some of the toughest sanctions that we've ever seen, and there are more to come. And it is my view that it would be contrary to the security interests of the United States and destabilizing for the world and the region, if Iran pursues, develops, obtains a nuclear weapon. So I've been very clear, and I've been talking about this quite a bit lately.What I've also been clear about is that the best way to resolve this issue is diplomatically and my belief that we still have a window in which to resolve this conflict diplomatically. That window is closing, and Iran needs to take advantage of it. But it is absolutely the right thing to do for the U.S. Government, working in concert with the other permanent members of the Security Council, with Germany, with the rest of the world community, to pursue this path.Part of the reason we've been able to build a strong international coalition that isolates Iran around the nuclear issue is because the world has confidence that I've been sincere and my administration has been sincere about giving Iran an opportunity to pursue peaceful nuclear energy while foreclosing the pursuit of a nuclear weapon. That strengthens our hand. That's part of the reason why we've been able to execute on these strong sanctions. And we're going to keep on seeing if we make progress.Now, the clock is ticking. And I've been very clear to Iran and to our negotiating partners that we're not going to have these talks just drag out in a stalling process. But so far, at least, we haven't given away anything other than the opportunity for us to negotiate and see if Iran comes to the table in good faith. And the notion that somehow we've given something away or a freebie would indicate that Iran has gotten something. In fact, they've got some of the toughest sanctions that they're going to be facing coming up in just a few months if they don't take advantage of these talks. I hope they do.Was there a--you guys ask too many questions. I start forgetting. Any foreign policy has a formula: Interests plus principles equals a foreign policy. So how do you combine these interests and principles, and how you defend those principles is what makes a foreign policy. In our case and in the case of many countries--countries that believe in freedom and democracy--we have the obligation to make sure that those principles are applied in every form possible and in every place possible.But there are different formulas to defend and apply those principles as well. There are certain paths that are more effective than others. In some cases, sanctions may work. Generally, they don't, but they may work in some cases. In some other cases, it has been proven that sanctions are not the solution, and in these cases, we need to then pursue the defense of those principles through other ways.And in our case, Colombia and other Latin American countries that believe in democracy and believe in freedom, we have the obligation to pursue those principles following the most effective paths. And I believe that that can yield the best results. Thank you very much, everybody. .", "label": "General"}

Let me just say, on the Prime Minister's point, that he will be shooting down those missiles very soon, once he completes his purchase of the military equipment from the United States. Just like we shot something down in Saudi Arabia. The Prime Minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. We make the best military equipment. He'll be purchasing it from the United States. Whether it's the F-35 fighter, which is the greatest in the world, or missiles, it's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan. As far as China is concerned, my relationship with President Xi is excellent. I like him a lot. I consider him a friend. He represents China; I represent the United States. His views are different on things, but they're similar on trade. The problem we have with China is that for decades it's been a very unfair trade situation. Our trade deficit is massive. It's hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and that doesn't include intellectual property. We've already started discussions with China because it has to come down. That has to do with free trade, fair trade, or reciprocal trade. I like reciprocal the best. It's understandable. We're going to charge the same as they're charging us. Reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have many countries that charge us a hundred-percent tax if we sell things into that country, and yet when they sell the same product into our country, we charge them nothing. You will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action. It's already started, but most of the legal foundation has now been done. You're going to see a very big difference, and it's going to happen very soon. Because the United States, by many countries, has been treated very, very unfairly when it comes to trade. Thank you very much. Regarding Japan defense equipment, a lot of them we purchase from the United States. North Korean situation becoming very tough, the Asia-Pacific security situation becoming very tough, we qualitatively and quantitatively, we have to enhance our defense capability. As the President mentioned, F-35A is a case in point. SM-3 Block IIA is another plan for purchase from the United States. Aegis vessels, the quality and the quantity must be enhanced. In that process, we will be buying more from the United States. That is what I am thinking. Now, North Korea: North Korea launched missiles. Immediately after that, we traced them; we were able to grasp and trace where they were going. Missile defense is something which is based upon the cooperation between Japan and the United States. Missile defense system is a cooperation between the two countries. For the intercepting and shooting down, if it is necessary, of course, we will do that—if it is necessary. But in doing so, U.S. and Japan will closely coordinate our actions. Thank you.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

He's an exceptional individual, incredibly intelligent, and an outstanding judge with a flawless record. I empathize with him and his family during this challenging time. These allegations should have been raised earlier. Senator Feinstein possessed the letter for an extended period; why didn't she address it sooner? The Democrats are simply obstructing and resisting. However, we should ensure a thorough process. I hope the accuser will come forward, and Judge Kavanaugh will have the opportunity to present his case before the Senate. Ultimately, they will vote based on his career and the evidence presented. He's a remarkable individual, and I feel deeply for him and his family.", "label": "Deflection"}

We've changed our approach to aid, demanding accountability and good governance in return for our assistance.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the UK's exemption from the travel ban despite higher coronavirus cases than many Schengen countries, why do they deserve this exception, especially with their recent surge in cases?

[SEP] Well, the Chancellor and I had a very productive discussion on this very topic. We've tasked our respective COVID teams to expedite a review of the existing travel restrictions. The situation is fluid, and we're constantly evaluating the data. An announcement regarding potential adjustments to the ban should be forthcoming in the days ahead.

You also met with Chinese President Xi during the summer, in which you renewed the ties of friendship between the two nations. Do you believe that countries, particularly western countries, that put Huawei equipment in their 5G cores are at risk of national security? [SEP] Thank you. Like I told already: In Europe, the situation is maybe a bit different from that here, because the main company you mentioned is inside Europe, partly, at least.What European Union is now doing is making a risk assessment, asking each country what kind of experience, what kind of—what you have seen and found out. And that will be, well, finished in week two—or 2 weeks' time. And after that, we have to decide together, in European Union, which kind of tools we need to protect ourselves.You referred to my discussions with the President Xi.

One of the debates that took place—and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country. The problem is, is that it's very hard to sort out sometimes why currency is going down and whether it's actually being manipulated.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you called for a deadline for U.N. action on Kosovo. When would you like that deadline set? And are you at all concerned that taking that type of a stance is going to further inflame U.S. relations with Russia?And is there any chance that you're going to sign on to the Russian missile defense proposal? [SEP] No, thanks. A couple of points on that. First of all, I don't think I called for a deadline. I thought I said, time; I did? What exactly did I say? I said, deadline? Okay, yes, then I meant what I said. [] The question is whether or not there is going to be endless dialog on a subject that we have made up our mind about. We believe Kosovo ought to be independent.The G-8 discussions were all aimed at determining whether or not there is a way to make this acceptable to Russia. The ideal would be for Russia to say: Okay, we understand, and we accept this conclusion as well. And obviously, they're not there yet. And therefore, the reason why I said there needs to be movement is that there just cannot be continued drift, because I'm worried about expectations not being met in Kosovo. That's what I meant. And therefore, we'll push the process. President Putin made an interesting proposal on missile defense for Europe. I suggested—and I've made an interesting proposal for missile defense in Europe, by the way, all aimed at protecting Europe, not aimed at Russia. The reason I did is because the true threats we'll be facing will be from rogue nations that may end up with a deliverable weapon. So, I thought it was in the interest of peace that we have the capacity to intercept such a missile, and, therefore, need to proceed.And President Putin said, Well, I think I've got an idea that makes sense. And this is the joint use of radar in Azerbaijan. I said, Well, why don't we look at it? But during the discussions, it became apparent that he also had doubts about the proposal I made, as to its effectiveness or necessity. And I said: Well, you put out an idea, and I put an idea. Why don't we both get a group together to discuss our relative ideas in a transparent fashion; so put—get people from your Foreign Ministry, and we'll get people from the State Department and our respective defense departments and militaries to sit at the table and to share different ideas, to share ideas about technologies on how to intercept a missile and radar positioning to make sure that there's effective coverage?I thought his statement was an important statement to make. In other words, he recognized that there's an opportunity to work together. That's what friends do, by the way. Russia is not our enemy. As I said repeatedly, the cold war is over, and now we're dealing with threats in the 21st century. And I appreciated his recognition that there could be an opportunity to work together to deal with those threats. I viewed it as a very positive gesture, and looking forward to continuing discussions on this very subject in July when he comes to Maine. I would like to add for the citizens of Kosovo and its leadership, in my discussions, I found out consciousness and awareness of President Bush for the consequences of prolongation on— unacceptable prolongation around justifiable—prolongation of the process.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with the ongoing tunnel operations, is a ceasefire truly viable at this point, or should we consider a different strategy? [SEP] Well, the proposed ceasefire allowed Israel to continue dismantling those tunnel networks, and they can do so without leveling Gaza's population centers. Dismantling those tunnels is absolutely necessary. There's a way to do it while minimizing bloodshed. Past conflicts have shown the devastating costs. The images we've seen – children, defenseless women, Israelis living in fear – are heartbreaking. A ceasefire that safeguards Israel's security, ensures they aren't constantly threatened by rockets, and acknowledges the Palestinian need for a decent life is crucial. It's a tough challenge, filled with anger and despair, but we must persevere. American leadership means stepping up when others won't. While these crises may pose tangential risks to the US, like ISIS, they aren't direct attacks. We intervene because of our unique responsibilities. We must be humble about our limitations, recognizing our finite resources after a decade of war. But we try. When John Kerry works to broker peace, we should support him, not criticize his efforts prematurely. No other nation is making such efforts. Our involvement usually leads to better outcomes, not perfect or immediate, but better. This applies to the Middle East, Ukraine, and Iraq. I'll conclude by reminding everyone that during my first term, the focus was on the economy and job creation. Our actions worked, and the economy improved. Six consecutive months of over 200,000 jobs created – a 17-year milestone – demonstrate the power of persistence.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "You previously stated that the Taliban posed no threat to the Afghan people. Who do you believe is now supporting the Taliban's actions of kidnapping and attacking government officials, and what are their motivations? [SEP] Four years ago, I made that statement, and I stand by it. The Taliban pose dangers to our innocent people, including children attending school, our clergy, teachers, engineers, and international aid workers. However, they do not pose a threat to the Government of Afghanistan, its institutions, or the development of those institutions. They are a defeated and frustrated force resorting to cowardly acts such as killing schoolchildren. The question of who is supporting them is one we have been actively investigating. I hope the jirga between us and Pakistan will offer some solutions. One thing is clear: we know their vision of governance. They have held power and demonstrated their beliefs and actions to the world. It would be beneficial to speak with a mother of a young girl about her experiences under Taliban rule. These individuals are brutal and cold-blooded killers. That is their nature. The fundamental question for those of us who believe in freedom is whether we confront them and whether the effort to promote an alternative to their hateful ideology is worthwhile. We have determined that it is. That is why President Karzai is here at Camp David, discussing shared concerns and opportunities to defeat this vision of darkness. They do not believe in freedom and do not believe in a society where individuals can freely express themselves. This is an ongoing challenge for the free world. The real question is whether those of us who are fortunate enough to enjoy liberty will continue to pursue policies that protect our homeland and create conditions for lasting peace.", "label": "General"}

And then on the other hand, is it intellectually consistent to say that gay and lesbians should be able to fight and die for this country but they should not be able to marry the people they love? [SEP] I don't want to go into detail about conversations in the Oval Office with my service chiefs. Jim Amos expressed the same concerns to me privately that he expressed publicly during his testimony. He said that there could be disruptions as a consequence of this. And what I said to him was that I was confident, looking at the history of the military with respect to racial integration, with respect to the inclusion of women in our Armed Forces, that that could be managed. And that was confirmed by the attitudinal studies that was done prior to this vote.And what he assured me of, and what all the service chiefs have assured me of, is that regardless of their concerns about disruptions, they were confident that they could implement this policy without it affecting our military cohesion and good discipline and readiness. And I take them at their word. And I've spoken to them since the vote took place and they have all said that we are going to implement this smartly and swiftly, and they are confident that it will not have an effect on our military effectiveness.So I'm very heartened by that.

We remain hopeful that mounting pressure will encourage them to enhance their economic performance, break free from isolation, and return to multilateral discussions, leading to a shift in their behavior.
