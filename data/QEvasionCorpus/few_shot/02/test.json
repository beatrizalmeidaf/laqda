{"sentence": "Mr. President, given your Nobel Peace Prize and the looming decision on Syria, how do you balance these conflicting roles? Furthermore, could you elaborate on how your conversation with Prime Minister Reinfeldt contributed to addressing the climate crisis? [SEP] On the Nobel, I refer you to my remarks upon receiving it, where I expressed my own sense of inadequacy relative to previous laureates. I spoke of the inherent challenge of advocating for peace in a world often defined by violence. The fundamental question is, what are our obligations? I've worked to end the war in Iraq, reduce our presence in Afghanistan, and champion diplomatic solutions. However, the question we all face is: at what point do we intervene against acts that offend our shared humanity? Witnessing the gassing of children, the senseless deaths of civilians, and possessing the means to alleviate this suffering, the ethical imperative is to act. This is the most challenging aspect of this office. I would prefer to dedicate my time to education rather than preventing chemical warfare against children. But as President, these are the choices I face. When crises erupt globally, the immediate question is always: what will the United States do? Libya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, now Syria.

{"sentence": "How do you view the Pope's recognition of Palestine? Does it help or hinder the two-state solution? [SEP] Let me begin by praising the Senate for empowering me to negotiate and enforce a forward-thinking trade pact with countries in the Asia-Pacific and Europe. I thank the Senators who backed the start of the debate. I will persist in attempting to persuade those who opposed it. Despite past issues with trade agreements, my strategy is advantageous to businesses of all sizes and, most crucially, to American workers. I would not champion any agreement that did not create jobs and boost incomes. My conflict with Elizabeth is not personal; it is a policy difference. Many of my Senate and House colleagues disagree with me, and I appreciate their concerns about plant closures and the relocation of jobs overseas. They are concerned about labor and environmental norms, as well as fair trade practices. They are also concerned about inequality and the repercussions of automation and globalization. They share my ideals, with the exception of trade. It is a policy disagreement on what is best for our people. I maintain that we are better off establishing stringent regulations with strong protections against child labor, deforestation, and other issues for the world's largest and fastest-growing market. If we do not, China will. Concerning outsourcing, companies can already engage in it. We have a chance to entice businesses back. Nike is bringing back 10,000 jobs as a result of technological advancements. We must sell our goods there. We need a high minimum wage, job training, infrastructure investments, collective bargaining, overtime pay, paid sick leave, and honest budgets. Preventing a trade agreement will not help. Existing trade regulations are harmful to workers. I am in favor of enforcement. I have misgivings about the currency language.

It's exhausting fighting back against the constant stream of fake news and biased reporting. But let's be clear: I won't be a punching bag. I'll defend myself and my policies. As for Congress, they need to understand that the American people want results, and I'm willing to work with anyone who's serious about delivering them, regardless of tone.", "label": "Deflection"}

My focus remains on ensuring a fair and lasting peace in the region. That means engaging with all parties, understanding their concerns, and working towards a solution that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. We need to create an environment where negotiations can succeed, and that requires careful diplomacy and a commitment from everyone involved. It's not just about trade deals; it's about building a future of peace and security for generations to come. And that's what I'm dedicated to achieving. I'm also dedicated to ensuring that we have the best possible trade deals for American workers. It's a balancing act, but I believe we can achieve both.", "label": "Clarification"}

Did those factors pose a risk to growth and integration for those countries, for your countries?And for President Barroso, given the proliferation of disputes between Europe and the United States over food safety issues, is there a concern that the EU is being too restrictive on those issues? [SEP] Okay, John, interesting idea by the—His Majesty, the King of Saudi Arabia. Secondly, I articulated a policy that I had been articulating ever since I have been the President. It's the same policy, which is, we believe in a strong dollar and that relative value of economies will end up setting the proper valuation of the dollar. Past growth, or growth with little comparison in the his-tory—this is the growth of energy and food prices. And the food prices are going up due to high cost of energy or oil, and this has a significant effect on the economy in Slovenia and throughout Europe. This is one of the key questions being dealt with at the national level and at the level of the European institutions, as has been mentioned by President Barroso. This is a serious problem. It will, on the one hand, make us search long-term solutions. I have mentioned this in part before. And on the other hand, it will make us search short-term solutions, and one of these is energy efficiency.We have also discussed this at today's summit, and this is a strong message. The investment in research and development, the investment into what the economy can do, an economy that is less dependent on carbon, less dependent on fossil fuels, this will have a long-term strategic effect on the price.So the key is the technology. I remember the President of the United States saying 2 years ago at the summit meeting in Vienna that the key thing is investment in the development of new technologies. This is the key strategic reply to these challenge. And as far as the euro is concerned, on the one hand, we are satisfied and happy that euro is a strong currency. And since the 1st of January of last year, Slovenia is also part of the euro zone. And I can say that in the majority, the effects are positive. When calculating the high prices of oil in dollars, this slightly mitigates this jump. And on the other hand, this is also a problem for importers in the European Union.

I can't comment on the specifics, but I'll address the core question. I've said this is a vital conversation. However, the leaks harmed the US and our intelligence. We could have had this debate without that damage. For example, the US, despite flaws, respects the law, privacy, civil liberties, and our Constitution. Because of these leaks, nations that do what Snowden fears—surveillance, targeting dissidents, suppressing the press—criticize the US. That's a distorted view.

He's a top-notch individual, and I think Melania would agree. He's been the doctor for President Obama, President Bush, and myself. He's a fantastic doctor. It was just a suggestion, and I'm aware of the experience concerns. The Veterans Administration is very important to me, and we've made significant progress with the Accountability Act and other things. And we're working on choice. We're going to take great care of our veterans. I even asked Admiral Jackson, 'Why do you want this job?' It's a brutal process. But he's an admiral, a great leader. They'll nitpick everything.

And does South Africa play a part in that? [SEP] Yes, thank you. I've answered my—the question on the words and terminologies. I will tell you that these are very difficult economic times—very difficult. And we'll let the economists define it for what it is. I would hope that those who worry about recession, slowdown— whatever you want to call it—make the tax cuts permanent as a way of helping to address this issue. Because if you're somebody out there trying to plan your future and you're worried about the future and you think your taxes are going to go up, it's going to cause different behavioral patterns.Secondly, I do want to thank the Members of Congress. And the man you talked to is a leader and did a very good job of helping shepherd through this billionsof-dollar package that is now beginning to hit America's pocketbooks. And we'll see how that goes. I hope it's as stimulative as we think it will be. But you can tell the good man you talked to, who is a good guy, that I fully understand that people are concerned. And they're concerned about high gasoline prices. They're worried about high food prices, worried about staying in their homes.The new issue, of course, is student loans. The House of Representatives passed a bill that—sponsored by Mr. Miller, George Miller, that is a—that we think can do the job. I hope the Senate moves a version of it very quickly so that we can help address this issue. I mean, one of the things that Government can do is either create more anxiety or less. And if you think your taxes are going to go up, that's going to make you anxious. If you think the Government is going to step in with a good policy that will help your child get a student loan, that will make you less anxious.One of the things we've done on home-ownership is the HOPE NOW Alliance, which, hopefully, makes people less anxious. Hopefully, it helps—has kind of brought some sense of not only concern but action into the marketplace.

And it is clear that they voted for change, as they should have, because the—Mr. Mugabe has failed the country.

The Government is intent upon—and is—intimidating the people there.We support the U.N. Security Council discussions that are going on. But the truth of the matter is, April—and you mentioned this—it's really incumbent upon the nations in the neighborhood to step up and lead and recognize that the will of the people must be respected and recognize that that will came about because they're tired of failed leadership.Thank you all for your interest.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, thank you, sir. And previously, when asked about Israel's September bombing of the Syrian facility, you refused aggressively to discuss it. Then suddenly last week, your administration released classified photos and details of that bombing, intelligence officials claiming that it showed that this facility was a North Korean-designed nuclear facility being actually built with the help of Pyongyang. Why the turnaround, sir? What did you hope that that would accomplish? And what do you say to lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill who are quite concerned that, indeed, if this was what this facility was, that it took some 8 months for you to inform them, sir? [SEP] Thank you. Let me correct the record. We briefed 22 Members of Congress on what I'm about to tell you. First, we were concerned that an early disclosure would increase the risk of a confrontation in the Middle East or retaliation in the Middle East. As I mentioned to you early on, we did notify 22 Members of Congress, key committee chairmen. And I was—I'm mindful that there was going to be this kind of reaction. And we—of course, we wanted to include more Members of Congress at a time when we felt the risk of retaliation or confrontation in the Middle East was reduced. And so that moment came upon us and then extended the briefings.We also wanted to advance certain policy objectives through the disclosures. And one would be to the North Koreans, to make it abundantly clear that we may know more about you than you think, and therefore, it's essential that you have a complete disclosure on not only your plutonium activities but proliferation as well as enrichment activities.And then we have an interest in sending a message to Iran, and the world for that matter, about just how destabilizing a—nuclear proliferation would be in the Middle East, and that it's essential that we work together to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at getting Iran to stop their enrichment programs. In other words, one of the things that this example shows is that these programs can exist and people don't know about them and—because the Syrians simply didn't declare the program. They had a hidden program.And finally, we wanted to make it clear to Syria and the world that their intransigence in dealing with—helping us in Iraq or destabilizing Lebanon or dealing with Hamas, which is a destabilizing force in our efforts to have a Palestinian state coexist peacefully with Israel, that those efforts are—it gives us a chance to remind the world that we need to work together to deal with those issues.

Sustaining economic growth and ensuring quality education for our children are also key. With the shift in Congress, bipartisan cooperation is essential for legislative progress. Expect increased engagement and dialogue with Democrats, as they now control committees and dictate bill flow. The Iraq War undeniably influenced the election, especially with televised images of conflict. Surprisingly, despite a strong economy, which often dictates off-year elections, a different sentiment prevailed among voters. The positive economic indicators were overshadowed by the challenges of the war. I recognize that some disagree with my decisions, but I'll continue to act in the country's best interests. I've never prioritized short-term popularity over my principles or decisions. I understand the public's frustration, which I share, wishing for a faster resolution. Secretary Rumsfeld agrees.

Are you taking action, and do you foresee Guantanamo's closure by the end of your term? [SEP] Closing Guantanamo, as I've stated, remains a goal.

So I'm curious to see what you would say about that.And, Mr. Prime Minister, if I may, on the same topic, you mentioned the international fight against terrorism in your opening remarks, and I wonder if you could reflect on President Obama's record here and if you think from an international perspective the U.S. is playing it right in marking this anniversary? Or if you think it--you might advise against excessive celebration? [SEP] Well, let me make a couple of points. First of all, Christi, I hardly think that you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here. I think that people--the American people rightly remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens. And it's a mark of the excellence of our intelligence teams and our military teams, a political process that worked. And I think for us to use that time for some reflection to give thanks to those who participated is entirely appropriate, and that's what's been taking place.As far as my personal role and what other folks would do, I'd just recommend that everybody take a look at people's previous statements in terms of whether they thought it was appropriate to go into Pakistan and take out bin Laden. I assume that people meant what they said when they said it. That's been at least my practice. I said that I'd go after bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him, and I did.If there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, then I'd go ahead and let them explain it. President Obama has been standing at the very forefront in the fight against terrorism, and I hold him in very high regard for that.Now, although bin Laden has been killed, terrorism has not been rooted out, and I think continued efforts will be needed in cooperation with the United States. We also would like to continue all our efforts against terrorism. I think the forms of terrorism are being very diverse, amongst them, cyberterrorism, for example. This--[inaudible]--between Japan and the United States not just in the cyber--in the space and ocean, but we also decided to cooperate in cybersecurity as well.

Nevertheless, I can't overstate my admiration for her. She embodies strong values and exceptional political acumen. She confronts challenging issues, even when unpopular with her constituents, because it's the right course of action. To the Democrats, I suggest giving the new administration a fair opportunity.

Also, how difficult was it to advocate for stimulus measures when your own efforts are currently stalled in Congress? [SEP] The conversation about stimulus measures was short, a while back. We discussed ways to boost economic growth, which don't always involve government spending. The rebalancing agenda, for instance, can significantly increase global demand through adjustments by countries, without traditional fiscal stimulus. There wasn't a disagreement with the Europeans. They agree it's important to show that the European project is strong, that they're committed to the euro, and that they're determined to solve the crisis. European leaders know this starts with a unified approach. We've seen all the pieces for dealing with the crisis put in place, which we think are the right ones. First, a solution for Greece, involving debt reduction, reforms, and structural changes, despite recent issues. Second, recapitalizing Europe's banks, which is key for market confidence.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much. My first question is to President Trump. Mr. President, you've spent the last 2 days reaffirming the U.S.-Japan alliance, and you've begun sketching out this vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. But in 2 days, you're going to travel to China, a country that is neither free nor open. So my question is, how can the U.S. be a force for freedom and openness in this region without inevitably coming into conflict with China?And then, to the Prime Minister: Mr. Prime Minister, the President has spoken on many occasions in the past about hoping to see the Japanese take a strong role in their own defense. He'd like to sell Japan military equipment, and there have been press reports that the President was disappointed that the Japanese didn't shoot the North Korean missile out of the sky, the one that was shot over Hokkaido. I'm wondering, did this subject come up? And what message did you have for the President about the role you'd like to see Japan take in its defense? [SEP] Thank you, Mark. I will say, if I could just take a piece of the Prime Minister's answer, he will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States. He will easily shoot them out of the sky, just like we shot something out of the sky the other day in Saudi Arabia, as you saw. And that was a very rapidly moving missile shot out of the sky. That was a needle in the sky, and it was hit immediately and exploded without damage.So one of the things, I think, that's very important is that the Prime Minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment, by far. He'll be purchasing it from the United States. Whether it's the F-35 fighter, which is the greatest in the world—total stealth—or whether it's missiles of many different kinds, it's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan and other countries that are likewise purchasing a lot of military equipment from us that, frankly, a year ago and 2 years ago were not.As far as China is concerned, my relationship, as you know, with President Xi is also excellent. I like him a lot. I consider him a friend. He considers me a friend. With that being said, he represents China; I represent the United States. His views are different on things, but they're pretty similar on trade.The problem we have with China is that for decades they've been—you know, it's been a very unfair—let me be very kind to previous administrations—it's been a very unfair trade situation. Our trade deficit is massive. It's hundreds of billions of dollars a year, anywhere from $350 billion to $504 billion, and that doesn't include intellectual property. And we've already started discussions with China because it has to come down. It has to come down. And that has to do with, really, free trade, fair trade, or reciprocal trade.And frankly, I like reciprocal the best of the group. Because when you explain to somebody that you're going to charge tariffs in order to equalize or you're going to do other things, some people that don't get it; they don't like to hear that. But when you say it's going to be reciprocal—that we're going to charge the same as they're charging us—the people that don't want a 5-percent or a 10-percent tariff say, oh, reciprocal is fair—and that could be 100 percent. So it's much more, Mark, understandable when you talk about reciprocal.And reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have many countries, not just China or Japan, or so many others that we see. I mean, we have one country that charges us a hundred-percent tax if we sell things into that country, and yet when they sell the same product into ourcountry, we charge them nothing. Now, I've been against that for a long time, and you will be seeing, we do things about it.Now, it also takes a period of time to do that, because, as you know, you have statutory limitations in time. You have to put out notices. You have to wait 90 days before you can put out the next, and then you have to wait another 120 days, and then a hundred—then a 30-day. Now, much of this has already been caught and caught up. Some of it was unnecessary, statutorily.But you will be seeing things of countries that have been treating the United States and the United States worker and companies—because I view the companies not as a company, I view it as an extension of the worker—but that have been treating our companies, our country, and our workers very unfairly.You will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action. It's already started, but most of the legal foundation has now been done. And you're going to see a very big difference, and it's going to happen very soon. Because the United States, by many countries, has been treated very, very unfairly when it comes to trade.Thank you very much. Regarding Japan defense equipment, a lot of them we purchase from the United States. North Korean situation becoming very tough, the Asia-Pacific security situation becoming very tough, we qualitatively and quantitatively, we have to enhance our defense capability. As the President mentioned, F-35A is a case in point. SM-3 Block IIA is another plan for purchase from the United States. Aegis vessels, the quality and the quantity must be enhanced. In that process, we will be buying more from the United States. That is what I am thinking.Now, North Korea: North Korea launched missiles. Immediately after that, we traced them; we were able to grasp and trace where they were going. Missile defense is something which is based upon the cooperation between Japan and the United States. Missile defense system is a cooperation between the two countries. For the intercepting and shooting down, if it is necessary, of course, we will do that—if it is necessary. But in doing so, U.S. and Japan will closely coordinate our actions. Thank you.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Medicare reform, are you open to exploring alternative approaches that would remove the issue from the political arena and entrust it to a panel of independent experts? [SEP] Well, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It—called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates—what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors.

We received a communication, indicating their interest in potential collaboration, though nothing substantial. I pride myself on maintaining positive relationships across the board. As I've previously suggested, my approach to foreign policy may surprise some. We are currently exploring potential agreements, and it would be wise for all parties to reach a resolution. I am patient, unlike those who are struggling. They were in a dire situation when I assumed office, facing numerous challenges. However, my focus on foreign policy has shifted the balance, and we are no longer being taken advantage of. We were essentially subsidizing the defense of certain nations while simultaneously incurring trade deficits with them. This is being rectified, and they are aware of it. I even questioned Prime Minister Abe about the trade imbalance, and he admitted that it had gone unchallenged for years. Similarly, with China, the tariff discrepancies were blatant.

{"sentence": "Q. So within that $2 trillion band, if you end up going for this middle-of-the-road package, which I think you referred to as the second option, would that need to have, for your signature, some sort of stimulative measures, either payroll tax extension or the extension of the unemployment insurance? [SEP] I think both would be good for the economy. A payroll tax cut is something that has put a thousand dollars in the pocket of the typical American family over the last 6, 7 months and has helped offset some of the rising costs in gasoline and food. And I think that American consumers and American businesses would benefit from a continuation of that tax cut next year.Unemployment insurance--obviously, unemployment is still too high. And there are a lot of folks out there who are doing everything they can to find a job, but the market is still tight out there. And for us to make sure that they are able to stay in their homes potentially or they're able to still support their families, I think, is very important and contributes to the overall economy.So I think there are ways that you can essentially take a little over a trillion dollars in serious discretionary cuts, meaningful discretionary cuts, and then start building on top of that some cuts in non-health-care mandatory payments, ethanol programs, or how we calculate various subsidies to various industries. That could potentially be layered on. And we could still do something like a tax cut for ordinary families that would end up benefiting the economy as a whole.That is not my preferable option, though. I just want to be clear. I think about this like a layer cake. You can do the bare minimum, and then you can make some progressively harder decisions to solve the problem more and more.And we're in a position now where if we're serious about this and everybody is willing to compromise, we can, as I said before, fix this thing probably for a decade or more.

Are you coming to the realization that you may just get nothing here and go to the American people in 2012 without another jobs bill, 9-percent unemployment, and them wondering about your leadership, sir? [SEP] Well, I think, first of all, the American people at this point are wondering about congressional leadership in failing to pass the jobs bill, the components of which the majority of Americans, including many Republicans, think are a good idea.And that's part of the reason why the American people right now aren't feeling real good about Congress. Normally, by the way, the way politics works is if the overwhelming majority of the American people aren't happy with what you're doing, you start doing something different. So far that hasn't happened in Congress, and the Republicans in Congress, in particular. They don't seem to have that same sense of urgency about needing to put people back to work.I'm going to keep on pushing. My expectation is, is that we will get some of it done now, and I'll keep on pushing until we get all of it done. And that may take me all the way till November to get it all done. And it may take a new Congress to get it all done. But the component parts--cutting taxes for middle class families, cutting taxes for small businesses that are hiring our veterans, hiring the long-term unemployed, put teachers back in the classroom--here in the State of Hawaii, you have a bunch of kids who are going to school 4 days a week because of budget problems. How are we going to win the competition in the 21st century with our kids going to school basically half time?The jobs bill would help alleviate those budget pressures at the State level.Rebuilding our infrastructure. Every world leader that you talk to, they're saying to themselves, how can we make sure we've got a first-class infrastructure? And as you travel through the Asia-Pacific region, you see having better airports than us, Singapore having superior ports to ours. Well, that's going to impact our capacity to do business here, our capacity to trade, our capacity to get U.S. products made by U.S. workers into the fastest growing market in the world. And by the way, we could put a lot of people back to work at the same time.So I'm going to keep on pushing. And my expectation is, is that we will just keep on chipping away at this. If you're asking me do I anticipate that the Republican leadership in the House or the Senate suddenly decide that I was right all along and they will adopt a hundred percent of my proposals, the answer is, no, I don't expect that. Do I anticipate that at some point they recognize that doing nothing is not an option? That's my hope.

James Baker himself, Secretary of State under your father, says that it's a lot like it was during the cold war when we talked to the Soviet Union. He says it's important to talk to your adversaries. Is he wrong? [SEP] Let me start with Iran. We made it perfectly clear to them what it takes to come to the table, and that is a suspension of their enrichment program. If they verifiably suspend—that they've stopped enrichment, we will come to the table with our EU-3 partners and Russia and discuss a way forward for them. Don, it should be evident to the Iranians, if this is what they want to do.I heard the Foreign Minister—I read the Foreign Minister say the other day that, Yes, we'll sit down with America, after they leave Iraq. If they want to sit down with us, for the good of the Iranian people, they ought to verifiably suspend their program. We've made that clear to them. It is obvious to them how to move forward.The Iranian people can do better than becoming—than be an isolated nation. This is a proud nation with a fantastic history and tradition. And yet they've got a leader who constantly sends messages to the world that Iran is out of step with the majority of thinkers, that Iran is willing to become isolated, to the detriment of the people.I mean, I was amazed that, once again, there was this conference about the Holocaust that heralded a really backward view of the history of the world. And all that said to me was, is that the leader in Iran is willing to say things that really hurts his country and further isolates the Iranian people.We're working hard to get a Security Council resolution. I spoke to Secretary Rice about the Iranian Security Council resolution this morning. And the message will be that you—you, Iran—are further isolated from the world.My message to the Iranian people is: You can do better than to have somebody try to rewrite history. You can do better than somebody who hasn't strengthened your economy. And you can do better than having somebody who's trying to develop a nuclear weapon that the world believes you shouldn't have. There's a better way forward.Syria, the message is the same. We have met with Syria since I have been the President of the United States. We have talked to them about what is necessary for them to have a better relationship with the United States, and they're not unreasonable requests.

[SEP] On Libya, the situation is fluid, and the transfer timeline depends on our commanding officers' assessment of mission completion. Our initial focus was neutralizing Libyan air defenses for the no-fly zone, ensuring coalition aircraft safety. Humanitarian aspects are also key. We anticipate this transition in days, not weeks. The Pentagon will brief the public. NATO will coordinate due to its capabilities, but Admiral Mullen will detail the transfer. As for the Americas partnership, I don't want to spoil my speech! But Chile offers much, like clean energy expertise. We seek a clean energy partnership. While we excel in alternative energy, Chile may have transferable initiatives. In education, we want American students to look outwards. A broad exchange program is crucial. Security cooperation is vital against narcotraffickers. Colombia's progress offers lessons for Central America. Joint training would be more effective. This partnership is a two-way street, not just aid to a poor country. Chile, a regional power, collaborates for peace and prosperity. We lag in Americas integration compared to Europe. They abandoned war for the Maastricht Treaty. President Bush Sr.'s free trade area idea never materialized. Latin America is ready to fulfill its potential. We share territory, hardworking people, and fewer racial/religious conflicts. We aim to recover lost time. We have much in common: Harvard ties, sports. The First Ladies admire each other. We seek a Partnership 2.0 with shared responsibilities, not existentialism. This alliance should be comprehensive: democracy, freedom, rule of law, human rights. We must improve the OAS democratic charter. It should open doors to free trade faster and include education, science, technology, innovation. These are pillars for Latin America to overcome poverty. We can learn from the US's innovation. This alliance addresses energy, water, organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, global warming, and world security. We need a new international order beyond Bretton Woods.

And if I may add, given that you have just witnessed the difficulties of averting economic problems beyond your control, what state do you think the economy will be in when you face reelection next year? [SEP] Jim, I have to tell you the least of my concerns at the moment is the politics of a year from now. I'm worried about putting people back to work right now, because those folks are hurting and the U.S. economy is underperforming. And so everything that we're doing here in the--here at the G-20 mirrors our efforts back home. That is, how do we boost growth, how do we shrink our deficits in a way that doesn't slow the recovery right now, how do we make sure that our workers are getting the skills and the training they need to compete in a global economy? And not only does the American Jobs Act answer some of the needs for jobs now, but it will also lay the foundation for future growth through investments in infrastructure, for example.So my hope is, is that the folks back home, including those in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives, when they look at today's job numbers--which were positive, but indicate once again that the economy is growing way too slow--that they think twice before they vote no again on the only proposal out there right now that independent economists say would actually make a dent in unemployment right now.

It happens to be in Saudi Arabia, but it's not *about* Saudi Arabia. I might see the King and Crown Prince, but that's not the main event.

The situation in Greece has implications for the United States. Uncertainty in Europe can make businesses think twice about investing.

Our position is, is that we ought to enforce the sanctions that are in place, and we ought to work with our allies to levy additional sanctions if they choose—if the ians choose to continue to ignore the demands of the free world. I personally have always come out very strongly in favor of seeing to it that sanctions are decided at the level of the United Nations Security Council too, because including China and Russia obviously makes for much greater effectiveness of such sanctions. But that doesn't exclude that within the European Union too, we may discuss, for example, are further possibilities open, for example, in the banking sectors? But these further possibilities, these further measures, must not lead to a situation where at the great-er—the bigger stage, so to speak, we then relent, because the more countries are in on this, the more the effect—the more effective the impact will be on , for example.We always think that quite often, on the one hand, people like to reject certain measures to be taken, but let us think of the people in .

I spoke to Madam Wu Yi today, as a matter of fact, had her into the Oval Office, wanted to thank her for bringing her delegation in and also to ask her to pass on a message to Hu Jintao that I appreciate his willingness to work in a strategic—with strategic dialogs in order to put in place the type of measures that reflect a complex relationship, in other words, the ability to discuss issues such as beef or intellectual property rights.And one of the issues that I emphasized to Madam Wu Yi, as well as the delegation, was, was that we're watching very carefully as to whether or not they will appreciate their currency. And that's all in the context of making it clear to China that we value our relationship, but the $233 billion trade deficit must be addressed. And one way to address it is through currency evaluations.Another way to address it is for them to help convert their economy from one of savers to consumers. And that's why Secretary Paulson worked very assiduously with this strategic dialog group to encourage openness for capital markets; that China must open its capital markets to allow for different financial institutions from around the world to go into the country. It not only will be beneficial to the United States, but we happen to think it will be beneficial to the Chinese economy, for the consumers to have different options when it comes to savings and purchases.And so this is a important dialog, and it's one that I thank the Chinese Government for engaging in. And there's been some progress. Yesterday they opened new air routes. That's beneficial for U.S. airlines. It also happens to be beneficial for China, as far I am concerned. It's beneficial for that country to open up its access to more travelers, whether they be business or tourists.Anyway, this is a complex relationship. And there's a lot of areas where we're working together, and there's areas where there's friction. And we've just got to work through the friction. One area where I've been disappointed is beef.

They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir. Have you made up your mind whether to take action against Syria whether or not you have a congressional resolution approved? Is a strike needed in order to preserve your credibility for when you set these sort of red lines? And were you able to enlist the support of the Prime Minister here for support in Syria? [SEP] Let me unpack the question. First of all, I didn't set a red line, the world set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use even when countries are engaged in war.Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty. Congress set a red line when it indicated that—in a piece of legislation titled the Syria Accountability Act—that some of the horrendous things that are happening on the ground there need to be answered for.And so when I said in a press conference that my calculus about what's happening in Syria would be altered by the use of the chemical weapons, which the overwhelming consensus of humanity says is wrong, that wasn't something I just, kind of, made up. I didn't pluck it out of thin air. There's a reason for it. So that's point number one.Point number two: My credibility is not on the line, the international community's credibility is on the line. And America and Congress's credibility is on the line because we give lip service to the notion that these international norms are important.And when those videos first broke and you saw images of over 400 children subjected to gas, everybody expressed outrage: How can this happen in this modern world? Well, it happened because a Government chose to deploy these deadly weapons on civilian populations. And so the question is, how credible is the international community when it says this is an international norm that has to be observed? The question is, how credible is Congress when it passes a treaty saying we have to forbid the use of chemical weapons?And I do think that we have to act, because if we don't, we are effectively saying that even though we may condemn it and issue resolutions and so forth and so on, somebody who is not shamed by resolutions can continue to act with impunity. And those international norms begin to erode. And other despots and authoritarian regimes can start looking and saying, that's something we can get away with. And that then calls into question other international norms and laws of war and whether those are going to be enforced.So, as I told the Prime Minister, I am very respectful of the U.N. investigators who went in at great danger to try to gather evidence about what happened. We want more information, not less. But when I said that I have high confidence that chemical weapons were used and that the Asad Government—through their chain of command—ordered their use, that was based on both public sourcing, intercepts, evidence that we feel very confident about, including samples that have been tested showing sarin from individuals who were there.And I'm very mindful of the fact that around the world—and here in Europe in particular—there are still memories of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction accusations and people being concerned about how accurate this information is. Keep in mind, I'm somebody who opposed the war in Iraq, and I am not interested in repeating mistakes of us basing decisions on faulty intelligence.But having done a thoroughgoing evaluation of the information that is currently available, I can say with high confidence chemical weapons were used. And by the way, Iran doesn't deny it. Even Syria doesn't actually deny that they were used. And that is what the U.N. investigators are supposed to be determining. And frankly, nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used. The only remaining dispute is who used them, which is outside the parameters of the U.N. investigation. So the U.N. investigation will not be able to answer that preliminarily; they're not supposed to.But what we know is, is that the opposition doesn't have the capability to deliver weapons on this scale. These weapons are in Asad's possession. We have intercepts indicating people in the chain of command, both before and after the attacks, with knowledge of these attacks. We can show that the rockets that delivered these chemical weapons went from areas controlled by Asad into these areas where the opposition was lodged. And the accumulation of evidence gives us high confidence that Asad carried this out.And so the question is, after we've gone through all this, are we going to try to find a reason not to act? And if that's the case, then I think the world community should admit it. Because you can always find a reason not to act. This is a complicated, difficult situation. And an initial response will not solve the underlying tragedy of the civil war in Syria. As Fredrik mentioned, that will be solved through, eventually, a political transition.But we can send a very clear, strong message against the prohibition—or in favor of the prohibition against using chemical weapons. We can change Asad's calculus about using them again. We can degrade his capabilities so that he does not use them again. And so what I'm talking about is an action that is limited in time and in scope, targeted at the specific task of degrading his capabilities and deterring the use of those weapons again.And in the meantime, we will continue to engage the entire international community in trying to find a solution to the underlying problems, which brings me to the last question. And that is, what happens if Congress doesn't approve it? I believe that Congress will approve it. I believe Congress will approve it because I think America recognizes that, as difficult as it is to take any military action—even one as limited as we're talking about, even one without boots on the ground—that's a sober decision.But I think America also recognizes that if the international community fails to maintain certain norms, standards, laws governing how countries interact and how people are treated, that over time, this world becomes less safe. It becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes, but to all of humanity. And we've seen that happen again and again in our history. And the people of Europe are certainly familiar with what happens when the international community finds excuses not to act.And I would not have taken this before Congress just as a symbolic gesture. I think it's very important that Congress say that we mean what we say. And I think we will be stronger as a country in our response if the President and Congress does it together.As Commander in Chief, I always preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of America's national security. I do not believe that I was required to take this to Congress. But I did not take this to Congress just because it's an empty exercise; I think it's important to have Congress's support on it.

{"sentence": "Q. Just following up on what Ben just talked about, you don't seem to be reflecting or second-guessing any of the policy decisions you've made, instead saying the message the voters were sending was about frustration with the economy or maybe even chalking it up to a failure on your part to communicate effectively. If you're not reflecting on your policy agenda, is it possible voters can conclude you're still not getting it? [SEP] Well, Savannah, that was just the first question, so we're going to have a few more here. I'm doing a whole lot of reflecting, and I think that there are going to be areas in policy where we're going to have to do a better job. I think that over the last 2 years, we have made a series of very tough decisions, but decisions that were right in terms of moving the country forward in an emergency situation where we had the risk of slipping into a second Great Depression.But what is absolutely true is that with all that stuff coming at folks fast and furious--a recovery package, what we had to do with respect to the banks, what we had to do with respect to the auto companies--I think people started looking at all this and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people's lives than they were accustomed to.Now, the reason was, it was an emergency situation. But I think it's understandable that folks said to themselves, you know, maybe this is the agenda, as opposed to a response to an emergency. And that's something that I think everybody in the White House understood was a danger. We thought it was necessary, but I'm sympathetic to folks who looked at it and said, this is looking like potential overreach.In addition, there were a bunch of price tags that went with that. And so even though these were emergency situations, people rightly said: Gosh, we already have all this debt; we already have these big deficits; this is potentially going to compound it. And at what point are we going to get back to a situation where we're doing what families all around the country do, which is make sure that if you spend something, you know how to pay for it, as opposed to racking up the credit card for the next generation.And I think that the other thing that happened is that when I won election in 2008, one of the reasons I think that people were excited about the campaign was the prospect that we would change how business is done in Washington. And we were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn't change how things got done. And I think that frustrated people.I'm a strong believer that the earmarking process in Congress isn't what the American people really want to see when it comes to making tough decisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent. And I, in the rush to get things done, had to sign a bunch of bills that had earmarks in them, which was contrary to what I had talked about. And I think, folks look at that and they said: Gosh, this feels like the same partisan squabbling; this seems like the same ways of doing business as happened before.And so one of the things that I've got to take responsibility for is not having moved enough on those fronts, and I think there is an opportunity to move forward on some of those issues. My understanding is Eric Cantor today said that he wanted to see a moratorium on earmarks continuing. That's something I think we can work on together.", "label": "Implicit"}

While the growth wasn't as robust as we'd like, there are steps we can take to strengthen the economy. First, we need to allow the current stimulus package to fully take effect and avoid raising taxes, which would be a detrimental move. Second, Congress needs to pass housing legislation that reforms FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, including a strong regulator to ensure these institutions stay focused on their core mission of providing mortgages. Third, we need to pass energy legislation. While it won't immediately produce more oil, it will signal to the world that we're committed to using new technologies to find reserves here at home.

{"sentence": "Q. And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job? [SEP] Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you'll recall, we were losing about 800,000 jobs a month.So the good news is that in some ways, my experience is atypical. It's hard to find an analogous situation. By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years. We were in the midst of a free fall. The financial system was locking up. The auto industry was about to go belly up. The housing market had entirely collapsed. So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job. We just had to make a bunch of decisions.In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously, there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected. Otherwise, we wouldn't have had the results that we had in the election. On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it's been in 8, 9 years. Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two. We've got historically low uninsured rates. The financial systems are stable. The stock market is hovering around its alltime high, and 401(k)s have been restored. The housing market has recovered.We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us. Our alliances are in strong shape. Ourthe progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth. And gas is 2 bucks a gallon.So he will have time and space, I think, to make judicious decisions. The incoming administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires. They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve.

The question is whether a process exists to give Palestinians hope for a secure state alongside Israel. Based on Netanyahu's statements, it's hard to see how that can happen.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, looking back at the Afghanistan campaign, can you confidently assert that the extensive sacrifices made were worthwhile, considering the current state of affairs in the region? And President Karzai, in light of persistent allegations of corruption and ineffective governance, how do you defend the allocation of international assistance, and will you guarantee a seamless transition of power following the upcoming elections? [SEP] We went to Afghanistan for one reason and one reason only: to take out Al Qaeda after they attacked us. We accomplished that mission. We degraded their capabilities, killed their leaders, and made it much harder for them to attack us again. Our troops did an incredible job. Now, did we turn Afghanistan into a Jeffersonian democracy? No. That was never the primary goal. But we created the conditions for a more stable and secure Afghanistan, one that is less likely to be a breeding ground for terrorists. We are in the process of achieving that goal. And for that, I think we have to thank our extraordinary military, intelligence, and diplomatic teams, as well as the cooperation of the Afghan Government and the Afghan people. As for corruption, it's a serious issue, and we're working with the Afghan government to combat it. It's not just about money; it's about building institutions and promoting good governance. We need to make sure that international aid is used effectively and that the Afghan people see the benefits. On the elections, I'm committed to a free and fair process. The Afghan people deserve to choose their own leaders, and I will respect their decision. On elections, for me, the greatest of my achievements, eventually, seen by the Afghan people, will be a proper, well-organized, interference-free election in which the Afghan people can elect their next President.

Additionally, how do you plan to address concerns regarding persuading less affluent nations to commit to climate objectives, especially in light of Republican opposition? And lastly, could you provide your perspective on the reports suggesting that intelligence officials have been manipulating assessments of the ISIL campaign? [SEP] Let me address the intelligence matter first. Since assuming office, I've been adamant about receiving unbiased intelligence, free from any political influence. Accurate intelligence is paramount for effective policymaking. I trust that our intelligence agencies grasp this principle. Regarding CENTCOM, we will thoroughly investigate any potential misconduct. I've directed the relevant authorities to uncover the truth. Disagreements in interpreting information are inevitable, but unwavering honesty is crucial. I haven't encountered overly optimistic accounts of the situations in Iraq and Syria. Turning to Paris, we must demonstrate our resolve. We will not succumb to intimidation. Terrorists cannot prevail if we deny them that victory. They are, at their core, simply murderers. We have triumphed over greater adversities in the past. The G-20, APEC, and ASEAN have all emphasized the significance of a robust Paris agreement. I remain optimistic. 160 nations have established targets, accounting for 90% of global emissions. Key components include differentiation, accountability, transparency, and regular review. Climate finance is indispensable for assisting developing nations in pursuing sustainable development. We are making headway toward fulfilling our $100 billion commitment. Critics contend that unilateral action is futile, but China's commitment has reshaped the landscape. Supporting nations like India is of utmost importance. Finally, the Paris attacks underscore the need for unity. We must not permit fear to dictate our course of action.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have been a strong supporter of the idea of a peaceful transfer of power, demonstrated not terribly far from here, out in the Rose Garden. And yet, even as you and I speak, there are more than five dozen Democrats that are going to boycott the Inauguration of the incoming President. Do you support that? And what message would you send to Democrats to better demonstrate the peaceful transfer of power?And if I could follow, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with the President-elect previously. And without getting into too much of the personal side of it, I'm just curious, were you able to use that opportunity to convince him to take a fresh look at some of the important ideas that you will leave this office with: maintaining some semblance of the Affordable Care Act, some idea of keeping DREAMers here in the country without fear of deportation. Were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him? And how successful were you? [SEP] Well, I won't go into details of my conversations with President-elect Trump. As I've said before, they are cordial. At times, they've been fairly lengthy, and they've been substantive. I can't tell you how convincing I've been. I think you'd have to ask him whether I've been convincing or not.I have offered my best advice, counsel about certain issues both foreign and domestic. And my working assumption is, is that having won an election opposed to a number of my initiatives and certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs to go, it is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values. And I don't expect that there's going to be enormous overlap.It may be that on certain issues, once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to, in fact, provide health care for everybody—something he says he wants to do—or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here.But I don't think we'll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk. And I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by his advisers, the people around him, which is why it's important to pay attention to these confirmation hearings.I can tell you that—and this is something I have told him—that this is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team: your Cabinet, your senior White House staff, all the way to fairly junior folks in their twenties and thirties, but who are executing on significant responsibilities.And so how you put a team together to make sure that they're getting you the best information and they are teeing up the options from which you will ultimately make decisions, that's probably the most useful advice, the most constructive advice that I've been able to give him. That if you find yourself isolated because the process breaks down, or if you're only hearing from people who agree with you on everything, or if you haven't created a process that is fact-checking and probing and asking hard questions about policies or promises that you've made, that's when you start making mistakes. And as I indicated in some of my previous remarks, reality has a way of biting back if you're not paying attention to it.With respect to the Inauguration, I'm not going to comment on those issues.

Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content, with all the fanfare around this deal, to leave the conscience of this Nation and the strength of this Nation unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans?And last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, under no circumstances should there be any relief for Iran in terms of ballistic missiles or conventional weapons. It is perceived that that was a last-minute capitulation in these negotiations. Many in the Pentagon feel you've left the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hung out to dry. Could you comment? [SEP] I've got to give you credit, Major, for how you craft those questions. [] First, the notion that I am content, as I celebrate, with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails, Major, that's nonsense, and you should know better. I've met with the families of some of those folks. Nobody is content. And our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out.Now, if the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates. Suddenly, Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals. It makes it much more difficult for us to walk away if Iran somehow thinks that a nuclear deal is dependent in some fashion on the nuclear deal. And by the way, if we had walked away from the nuclear deal, we'd still be pushing them just as hard to get these folks out. That's why those issues are not connected. But we are working every single day to try to get them out and won't stop until they're out and rejoined with their families.With respect to the Chairman's testimony, to some degree I already answered this with Carol. We are not taking the pressure off Iran with respect to arms and with respect to ballistic missiles. As I just explained, not only do we keep in place for 5 years the arms embargo under this particular new U.N. resolution, not only do we maintain the 8 years on the ballistic missiles under this particular U.N. resolution, but we have a host of other multilateral and unilateral authorities that allow us to take action where we see Iran engaged in those activities whether it's 6 years from now or 10 years from now.So we have not lost those legal authorities. And in fact, part of my pitch to the GCC countries, as well as to Prime Minister Netanyahu, is we should do a better job making sure that Iran is not engaged in sending arms to organizations like Hizballah.

If you are, you have to look at unfair spending through the Tax Code, tax breaks that don't make us more competitive or create jobs here.

Why not invest in future energy, not just the past, especially if the past is profitable and doesn't need a break? If we're serious about cutting the deficit and debt, we need to look at all sources. We can't just pick and choose. The same goes for Democrats. Some things in this budget are hard for me. Cities and states are struggling because of lost revenue. They have more demands because people lost jobs, and the housing market is tough. But this budget cuts community development block grants by 10 percent. I don't like that, but I'm saying yes.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given the Republican nominee's recent comments about the Khan family and his statement that, if President, he would consider recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, does it make you question his fitness to be President?And secondly, sir, on Libya. You've said in the past that the worst mistake of your Presidency may have been your failure to plan for the aftermath of that 2011 NATO intervention in Libya. Do you see your new decision to bomb ISIS there as a direct result of that? [SEP] Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as President. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country, the fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia, means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job.And this is not just my opinion. I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader and prominent Republicans like John McCain. And the question, I think, that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer? This isn't a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he's making. There has to be a point in which you say, this is not somebody I can support for President of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.And the fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity. I don't doubt that they were outraged about some of the statements that Mr. Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family. But there has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.Because a lot of people depend on the White House getting stuff right, and this is different than just having policy disagreements. Now, I recognize that they all profoundly disagree with myself or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or on certain elements of foreign policy. But there have been Republican Presidents with whom I disagreed with, but I didn't have a doubt that they could function as President. I think I was right and Mitt Romney and John McCain were wrong on certain policy issues, but I never thought that they couldn't do the job. And had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have said to all Americans, they are—this is our President, and I know they're going to abide by certain norms and rules and common sense, will observe basic decency, will have enough knowledge about economic policy and foreign policy and our constitutional traditions and rule of law that our Government will work, and then we'll compete 4 years from now to try to win an election.But that's not the situation here. And that's not just my opinion; that is the opinion of many prominent Republicans. There has to come a point at which you say, enough. And the alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump. And as I said in my speech last week, I don't think that actually represents the views of a whole lot of Republicans out there.With respect to Libya, I have said on several occasions that we did the right thing in preventing what could have been a massacre, a blood bath in Libya. And we did so as part of an international coalition and under U.N. mandate. But I think that all of us, collectively, were not sufficiently attentive to what had to happen the day after and the day after and the day after that, in order to ensure that there were strong structures in place to assure basic security and peace inside of Libya.The good news is, is that we now have the beginnings of a government in the Government of National Accord. They are serious about trying to bring all the factions together to start creating a basic security structure to begin to monitor Libya's borders and to cooperate internationally to deal with issues like ISIL penetration on their territory. And at the request of that Government, after they had already made significant progress against ISIL and had essentially pushed ISIL into a very confined area in and around Sirte, it is in America's national security interests in our fight against ISIL to make sure that they're able to finish the job. And so we're working in partnership with them to assure that ISIL does not get a stronghold in Libya, even as Libya begins what is going to be a long process to establish a functioning government and security system there.So the good news is that they recognize these—this terrorist organization in their midst is contrary to their national interests, as well as the world's. And we're hopeful that having completed this process of driving ISIL out, they will then be in a position to start bringing the parties together inside that country. And not only us, but the Europeans and other countries around the world have a great interest in seeing stability in Libya, because that—the absence of stability has helped to fuel some of the challenges that we've seen in terms of the migration crisis in Europe and some of the humanitarian tragedies that we've seen in the open seas between Libya and Europe.

How much leverage do you believe China has in dissuading North Korea, and what consequences might arise for U.S.-China relations if a test proceeds? [SEP] Well, first, let me say that it's hard to be absolutely sure about China's influence over North Korea. Second, I've told President Xi that I believe they have a responsibility to try and convince North Korea not to conduct these tests. And I also made it clear that if they do – if North Korea does – we'd have to take certain defensive steps. These wouldn't be aimed at China, but they'd send a clear message to North Korea. We're committed to protecting our allies, our own soil, and our capabilities. Now, whether China has the power to prevent this, that's hard to say. But I'm confident they don't want North Korea escalating things further. I've been clear from the start that we'll do what's necessary to defend ourselves and our allies – South Korea and Japan. This might put us in a position that China doesn't like, but that wouldn't be because of China, it would be because of North Korea's actions. We've got teams working on this, our National Security Advisor, Secretary of Defense, engaging with their Chinese counterparts. We won't solve everything, this isn't some kumbaya moment where everyone agrees. But I don't think we need to worry about a new Cold War. I want to be clear with all leaders, especially Xi Jinping, that I mean what I say and say what I mean. Misunderstandings are the biggest risk.

[SEP] Trying to remember if I told anyone to look into that. Can't say I specifically remember ordering an investigation. I do remember being annoyed about all the leaks. You guys work hard to dig up stuff and put it out there, I get that. But I don't like people leaking classified stuff. It's a constant problem, not just for us, but for any administration trying to make policy that matters. We've had a lot of leaks, some from—I don't know where they're coming from, so I won't guess. You can never find the leaker, can you? It's a perk of your job. We can complain about it, but it's tough to find the guys inside who are handing over, in this case, Hadley's memo to the papers. There might be an investigation going on; I just don't know. If there is, and I knew about it, I've forgotten. But I think it'd be good if we could find the people in our government who are leaking stuff, which is illegal, and make them pay.

However, as was mentioned, the political forces that propelled him into the Speakership, while effective in a midterm election, present challenges for governing.

But as I indicated to Ben in the earlier question, you take a look at what we've been able to accomplish in mobilizing the world community against over the last 3 years, and it shows steady, determined, firm progress in isolating the ian regime and sending a clear message that the world believes it would be dangerous for them to have a nuclear weapon.Now, is this an easy issue? No. Anybody who claims it is, is either politicking or doesn't know what they're talking about.

We must convey the message to cease the shipment of sophisticated equipment that is causing the deaths of our citizens. Our negotiation of a long-term security agreement with Iraq is precisely aimed at providing their democracy with the necessary space to develop. My message to Ahmadi-nejad is unequivocal: cease the export of terror. The international community is resolute in its commitment to isolate Iran until they provide transparency regarding their nuclear weapons ambitions. We will be taking action at the United Nations next week to reinforce this clear message. Concerning troop levels, there will undoubtedly be considerable speculation surrounding my decision. I can only assure you that it will be predicated on the recommendations of Secretary Gates, General Petraeus, and the Joint Chiefs. My sole criterion is the attainment of success. Failure in Iraq would have profound consequences for global peace and the security of the United States. Therefore, my inquiry is: what is required to ensure success? We will not allow political considerations to dictate my decision. Had I been swayed by polls, I would not have authorized the deployment of additional troops.

First, I think people saw those debates last night, and they thought, 'If there's even a chance that could happen...' and that really shook things up.

[SEP] No, I don't think so. I mean, I think that's—that would be ascribing motives that are just—I just don't think they're the motives of the House leaders to do that.

Your Deputy Prime Minister has expressed even stronger views. Did you discuss that with the President today? And if not, would now be a good moment to share your views with us once again?Prime Minister Cameron. Shall I go? [SEP] Please, go ahead. It is something that we discussed in our meeting. I mean, clearly there's a discussion going on between the British and the Americans about this, and I don't want to prejudice those discussions. We completely understand that Gary McKinnon stands accused of a very important and significant crime in terms of hacking into vital databases. And nobody denies that that is an important crime that has to be considered. But I have had conversations with the U.S. Ambassador, as well as raising it today with the President, about this issue, and I hope a way through can be found. Well, one of the things that David and I discussed was the increasing challenge that we're going to face as a consequence of the Internet and the need for us to cooperate extensively on issues of cybersecurity.We had a brief discussion about the fact that although there may still be efforts to send in spies and try to obtain state secrets through traditional cold war methods, the truth of the matter is, these days, where we're going to see enormous amounts of vulnerability when it comes to information is going to be through these kind of breaches in our information systems. So we take this very seriously. And I know that the British Government does as well.Beyond that, one of the traditions we have is the President doesn't get involved in decisions around prosecutions, extradition matters. So what I expect is that my team will follow the law, but they will also coordinate closely with what we've just stated is an ally that is unparalleled in terms of our cooperative relationship.

We have to be in those communities. And I've seen that when we are in those communities, it makes a difference.That's how I became President. I became a U.S. Senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving around downstate Illinois and going to fish fries and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers. And I didn't win every one of their votes, but they got a sense of what I was talking about, what I cared about, that I was for working people, that I was for the middle class, that the reason I was interested in strengthening unions and raising the minimum wage and rebuilding our infrastructure and making sure that parents had decent childcare and family leave was because my own family's history wasn't that different from theirs, even if I looked a little bit different. Same thing in Iowa.And so the question is, how do we rebuild that party as a whole so that there's not a county in any State—I don't care how red—where we don't have a presence and we're not making the argument. Because I think we have the better argument. But that requires a lot of work. It's been something that I've been able to do successfully in my own campaigns. It is not something I've been able to transfer to candidates in midterms and sort of build a sustaining organization around. That's something that I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're also dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House.And that doesn't mean, though, that it can't be done. And I think there are going to be a lot of talented folks out there, a lot of progressives who share my values who are going to be leading the charge in the years to come.Michelle Kosinski of CNN.The President's Communications With President-Elect Donald J. Trump/Federal Bureau of Investigation  Q. Thank you. So this week we heard Hillary Clinton talk about how she thinks that the FBI Director's most recent announcement made a difference in the outcome of the election. And we also just heard in an op-ed her campaign chairman talk about something being deeply broken within the FBI. He talked about thinking that the investigation early on was lackadaisical in his words. So what do you think about those comments? Do you think there's any truth to them? Do you think there's a danger there that they're calling into question the integrity of institutions in a similar way that Donald Trump's team has done?And a second part to that is that Donald Trump's team repeatedly—I guess, giving the indication that the investigation of the Russian hack, as well as the retaliation, might not be such a priority once he's in office, so what do you think the risk is there? And are you going to talk to him directly about some of those comments he made? [SEP] Well, on the latter point, as I said before, the transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. It's bumpy. There are still feelings that are raw out there. There are people who are still thinking about how things unfolded. And I get all that. But when Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn as the 45th President of the United States, then he's got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. And I've said this before: I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office. And I haven't shared previously private conversations I've had with the President-elect. I will say that they have been cordial and, in some cases, have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to ensure that regardless of our obvious deep disagreements about policy, maybe I can transmit some thoughts about maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can't say that he will end up implementing, but the conversations themselves have been cordial as opposed to defensive in any way. And I will always make myself available to him, just as previous Presidents have made themselves available to me as issues come up.With respect to the FBI, I will tell you, I've had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents, I know Director Comey. They take their job seriously, they work really hard, they help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. And it is always a challenge for law enforcement when there's an intersection between the work that they are doing and the political system. It's one of the difficulties of democracy, generally. We have a system where we want our law enforcement investigators and our prosecutors to be free from politics, to be independent, to play it straight, but sometimes, that involves investigations that touch on politics. And particularly in this hyperpartisan environment that we've been in, everything is suspect, everything you do one way or the other.One thing that I have done is to be pretty scrupulous about not wading into investigation decisions or prosecution decisions or decisions not to prosecute. I have tried to be really strict in my own behavior about preserving the independence of law enforcement, free from my own judgments and political assessments, in some cases. And I don't know why I would stop now.Mike Dorning of Bloomberg. There you are.'s Sense of Personal Responsibility for Addressing International Crises/Syria", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering John Howard's dedication to climate change at this APEC gathering, hasn't your scheduled meeting in Washington detracted from his goals? Furthermore, how relevant do you consider the Kyoto Protocol in addressing climate change? [SEP] Let's tackle the latter point first. As I get on in years, you might have to remind me of things. Kyoto might work for some countries, but it didn't make sense for the United States. I was honest about that. Before I came to Washington, the Senate voted 95-0 against Kyoto. So, it's not just my opinion. We developed a different approach: energy efficiency standards based on new technologies. We reduced greenhouse gases in America last year, and our economy grew by 3%. I don't know if many countries can say that. Our strategy of putting new technologies in place is working. I believe we can do a better job of becoming less dependent on foreign oil. As an energy exporter, that might frighten some. We have a '20-in-10' program to reduce gasoline consumption by 20% in 10 years using ethanol and other new technologies. Battery technology will let people in Sydney drive 40 miles on battery without their car looking like a golf cart. New technologies are coming. The question is, how do we get them to market quickly? Kyoto didn't do that for us. If you look at who's meeting the Kyoto targets, you might find a different approach makes more sense. We rejected Kyoto because it wouldn't have allowed us to grow our economy, become less dependent on foreign oil, and be good stewards of the environment. John and I talked about his desire to put climate change at the forefront of APEC, and I supported that. At the G-8, I said that if we want to solve global climate change, we need to get everyone to the table, including China and India. Otherwise, if they feel like nations are going to force a solution on them without giving them a voice, they'll walk. You can't have effective global climate change if China isn't involved. The Prime Minister did something smart in this protocol. He announced that we need to cut back on tariffs that prohibit the exportation of technologies that will enable China to burn coal in a cleaner way. He wants to tear down those barriers, and we support him. The key questions are: How fast can we get effective technology to market—coal sequestration, nuclear spent fuel reprocessing? And can we help developing nations acquire those technologies? Otherwise, it's not going to be effective. Our strategy is the most effective way to deal with this issue. I appreciate the Prime Minister bringing the issue to focus and talking about energy dependency and efficiency, which are part of the global climate mix. He shows leadership, and I'm proud to be here talking about it. Okay. Thank you.", "label": "Clarification"}

How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away? [SEP] Well, I can't guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious—it's not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala—I mean, in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying: I've got a great idea.

That's not how it happens.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I know some of my colleagues will get into some specific issues, but I wanted to zoom out on your first year in office.Inflation is up. Your signature domestic legislation is stalled in Congress. In a few hours from now, the Senate—an effort in the Senate to deal with voting rights and voting—voting reform legislation is going to fail. COVID-19 is taking the lives of 1,500 Americans every day. And the Nation's divisions are just as raw as they were a year ago. Did you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office? And how do you plan to course-correct going forward? [SEP] Why are you such an optimist? []Look, I didn't overpromise, and—but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress. You mentioned the number of deaths from COVID; well, it was three times that not long ago. It's coming down. Everything is changing. It's getting better.Look, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.But one of the things that I think is something that—one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day—and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him—a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to—excuse me, Governor Sununu—when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.Here's what he said: They were all, for the most—quote—They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do, Sununu said.He went on to say, It bothered me that they were okay with that. And then he goes on to say, I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back—if we win the White House back. Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018? And then, he said—how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.And so the problem here is that I think what happens—what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.Remember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that—you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when—that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole—I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.And I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that. And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.And one of the things that I remember saying—and I'll end this—I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act—I said, You ought to take a victory lap. And he said, There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.As a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.And so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.You know, one of the things that I remember—and I'll end this with—I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said—and when he would endorse me—and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access—access—to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that. We can't afford not to do it.So I tell my Republican friends: Here I come.

{"sentence": "Mr. President Obama, considering the sluggish progress of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress, and with other nations awaiting U.S. action, will your administration adjust its strategy for securing congressional approval, especially given the Boeing and GE deals announced during your Vietnam visit? Should the agreement be revised to address currency manipulation? Also, your thoughts on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and Pakistan's concerns regarding the strike on their territory? Does this signal a new offensive in Afghanistan, and are you concerned about a more hardline successor? [SEP] Look, on TPP, I've been around the block enough to know that every trade deal is a tough sell. Everyone wants a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. It's going to be scrutinized, debated, and in an election year, some folks will try to score political points. That being said, I'm still confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do for America and the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for us. Most countries here already sell to the U.S. with low tariffs, while our goods face higher tariffs there. This deal eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in those markets – a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for opening our markets to countries with lower wages and lax labor and environmental standards. TPP addresses this by including enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and protect the environment. As for currency manipulation, we have provisions for transparency and monitoring. Some argue for enforceable provisions to impose tariffs if currency is devalued, but it's hard to determine the cause of currency devaluation. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. However, we've strengthened provisions to address competitive devaluations. Finally, regarding Mullah Mansur, his death is confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This isn't a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself. However, when a high-profile leader consistently plans to harm U.S. personnel and resists peace talks, I have a responsibility to protect our people.

{"sentence": "Q. Took a kind of confrontational approach to him. You had brief discussions with him at APEC. How confrontational or not were those encounters? Did you have any further exchanges with him here? What, if any, projects—progress did you make with him on the Ukraine issue? And of course, you've now just met with EU leaders. Did you agree on further sanctions?One other question, sir, on a domestic subject. Are you prepared to state unequivocally that if Congress does pass a Keystone pipeline bill, that you would veto it if it comes to your desk? [SEP] I had naturally several interactions with President Putin during the course of the APEC summit and then here at the G-20. I would characterize them as typical of our interactions, which are businesslike and blunt. And my communications to him was no different than what I've said publicly as well as what I've said to him privately over the course of this crisis in Ukraine, and that is, Russia has the opportunity to take a different path, to resolve the issue of Ukraine in a way that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and is consistent with international law. That is our preference, and if it does so, then I will be the first to suggest that we roll back the sanctions that are frankly having a devastating effect on the Russian economy.If he continues down the path that he is on—violating international law, providing heavy arms to the separatists in Ukraine, violating an agreement that he agreed to just a few weeks ago, the Minsk agreement, that would have lowered the temperature and the killing in the disputed areas and make providing us a pathway for a diplomatic resolution—then the isolation that Russia is currently experiencing will continue.And in my meeting with European leaders, they confirmed their view that so far, Russia has not abided by either the spirit or the letter of the agreement that Mr. Putin signed—or agreed to, and that as a consequence, we are going to continue to maintain the economic isolation while maintaining the possibility of a diplomatic solution.It is not our preference to see Russia isolated the way it is. We would prefer a Russia that is fully integrated with the global economy, that is thriving on behalf of its people, that can once again engage with us in cooperative efforts around global challenges.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. You've said many times that you plan to sprint to the finish of your Presidency. At this point in the home stretch, what can you say you're still expecting to accomplish? And how concerned are you that the immigration bill in particular is going to get caught up in electoral politics? [SEP] Yes, thanks. Well, we need to pass additional energy legislation. We need to renew No Child Left Behind. Get these trade bills out of Congress—the trade bills on Panama and Peru and Colombia, hopefully, work toward a free trade— further the work we've done on the Korean free trade agreement. Hopefully, I'll be able to bring back successful negotiations on Doha for a congressional vote which will require a TPA extension and/or—a TPA extension, there's no and/or to it. Making sure that this progress on balancing the budget continues. The deficit is—I know you're following the numbers, John— the deficit is reduced more than anticipated as a result of increased tax revenues coming in and the fiscal measures that we took. And now we're going to have to work with Congress to make sure they don't overspend and make sure they don't raise the taxes on the people as well.Running up the taxes will hurt this economy, which would hurt the revenues to the Treasury. I'm deeply concerned about the Democratic budget that is classic tax and spend. I'm looking forward to seeing how they intend to keep their promise of balancing this budget in 5 years.A big—and of course, fighting this war on terror is a huge issue. I obviously would like to find common ground on how to proceed in Iraq, with Democrats and Republicans. I recognize there are a handful there or some who just say, Get out, it's just not worth it, let's just leave. I strongly disagree with that attitude; most Americans do as well. And the vote showed that what's possible when we work together, the vote— the pending vote today showed what's possible when we work together, when Republicans and Democrats work together. There's a good group of Republicans that want to work with Democrats. They just don't want to accept something that they don't agree with.Immigration, this is a tough issue. This is a very emotional, hard issue for members of both parties. I've always been a believer that comprehensive immigration reform is the best way to secure our border. I campaigned on that for President twice. I believed it when I was the Governor of Texas. I understand this issue very well. I also understand the frustrations of many citizens in that they believe the government hasn't done its job of stopping illegal migrants from coming into the country.And that's why over the past couple of years there's been a significant effort to secure the border. There's going to be a doubling of the Border Patrol agents; there's going to be fencing and berms and different types of equipment to help the Border Patrol do its job in a better way. As a matter of fact, I was concerned about it enough to ask the National Guard to go down there for a while.And—but, John, I don't see—and so those concerns, by the way, are addressed in this bill. The bill essentially says that before any other reforms take place, certain benchmarks will be met when it comes to securing the border. Last year, during the debate, people said, well, let's have security first. That's exactly what the bill does.However, I don't see how you can have the border security the American people expect unless you have a temporary-worker program, with a verifiable work card. People will come here to do work to feed their families, and they'll figure out ways to do so. As a result of people wanting to come here to do work to feed their families, there is an underground industry that has sprung up that I think is essentially antihumanitarian. It is an industry based upon ; those are smugglers. Good, hard-working, decent people pay pretty-good-size money to be smuggled into the United States of America.There is a document forgery industry in America. There are people who are willing to stuff people inside temporary shelter in order for them to evade the law. I don't think this is American. I think the whole industry that exploits the human being is not in our Nation's interests. And the best way to deal with this problem is to say, if you're going to come and do jobs Americans aren't doing, here is a opportunity to do so, on a temporary basis. I would much rather have people crossing the border with a legitimate card, coming to work on a temporary basis, than being stuffed in the back of an 18-wheeler. And I would hope most Americans feel that as well.Secondly, in order for there to be good employer verification—it's against the law to hire somebody who is here illegally, but many times small businesses or large are presented with documents, and they don't know whether they're real or not. And so therefore, we must have a tamper-proof identification card, which is a part of this bill.A tough issue, of course, is what do you do with the people already here? Anything short of kicking them out, as far as some people are concerned, is called amnesty. You can't kick them out. Anybody who advocates trying to dig out 12 million people who have been in our society for a while is sending a signal to the American people that's just not real. It's an impractical solution. Nor do I think they ought to be given automatic citizenship; that is amnesty— okay, you're here illegally, therefore, you're automatically a citizen.And so therefore, we proposed and worked with the Senate to devise a plan that said, if you're here already before a certain date, that there are certain hurdles you must cross in order to receive what's called a Z visa, in order to be able to work here. You've got to go through a background check; you've got to pay a fine at some point in time; there's a probationary period. And there's a series of steps that people have to go through, and then people get at the back of the line—the citizenship line—not the beginning of the citizenship line.If you're for the bill, I thank you; if you're against it, you can find every reason in the world to be against a comprehensive bill. It's easy to find something to be against in this bill. All it takes is to take one little aspect of it and ignore the comprehensive nature and how good it is.I knew this was going to be an explosive issue. It's easy to hold up somebody who is here and working hard as a political target. I would like to get this bill done for a lot of reasons. I'd like to get it done because it's the right thing to do. I'd like to get it done because I happen to believe the approach that is now being discussed in the Senate is an approach that will actually solve the problem. I'd like to get it out of politics. I don't think it's good to be, you know, holding people up. We've been through immigration debates in this country, and they can bring out the worst, sometimes, in people. We're a land of immigrants.I was touched yesterday when the kid from the Coast Guard Academy—ensign, now ensign—talked about his migrant grandfather from Mexico. And here's this guy—this man standing up in front of the President of the United States and his class, talking about serving America. He wasn't— you know, his grandfather wasn't born here. I don't know what job he did; I suspect it was probably manual labor. I don't know; I didn't ask him.But I do know he spoke with pride. I do know he represents the best about what immigration can mean for America. You know, welcoming people here who want to work and realize the American Dream renews our spirit and soul. It's been the case throughout generations. And we have an opportunity to put a good law in place now; right now. And it's going to be hard work. And sure, politics will get involved. But the question is, will Members of Congress rise above politics? I will. It's the right thing to have a comprehensive bill.And so I'm going to continue to reach out to Members of Congress from both parties and call upon them to take the lead and show the political courage necessary to get the bill to my desk as quickly as possible.I want to thank you for your interest.", "label": "Implicit"}

I know that, as you said, there was dramatic change in 3 weeks, and some of us wanted it to go even faster than that. But having said that, I realize it's a complicated situation. It was evolving rapidly. But now as these protests grow throughout the Mideast and North Africa--you said before your message to the governments involved was make sure you're not violent with peaceful protesters. But what's your message to the protesters? Do you want them to taste freedom? Or do you want them to taste freedom only if it will also bring stability to our interests in the region? [SEP] Well, first of all, without revisiting all the events over the last 3 weeks, I think history will end up recording that at every juncture in the situation in Egypt, that we were on the right side of history. What we didn't do was pretend that we could dictate the outcome in Egypt, because we can't. So we were very mindful that it was important for this to remain an Egyptian event; that the United States did not become the issue; but that we sent out a very clear message that we believed in an orderly transition, a meaningful transition, and a transition that needed to happen not later, but sooner. And we were consistent on that message throughout.Particularly if you look at my statements, I started talking about reform 2 weeks or 2 1/2 weeks before Mr. Mubarak ultimately stepped down. And at each juncture I think we calibrated it just about right. And I would suggest that part of the test is that what we ended up seeing was a peaceful transition, relatively little violence, and relatively little, if any, anti-American sentiment or anti-Israel sentiment or anti-Western sentiment. And I think that testifies to the fact that in a complicated situation, we got it about right.My message, I think, to demonstrators going forward is, your aspirations for greater opportunity, for the ability to speak your mind, for a free press, those are absolutely aspirations we support.As was true in Egypt, ultimately, what happens in each of these countries will be determined by the citizens of those countries. And even as we uphold these universal values, we do want to make sure that transitions do not degenerate into chaos and violence. That's not just good for us, that's good for those countries. The history of successful transitions to democracy have generally been ones in which peaceful protests led to dialogue, led to discussion, led to reform, and ultimately led to democracy.And that's true in countries like Eastern Europe. That was also true in countries like Indonesia, a majority Muslim country that went through some of these similar transitions, but didn't end up doing it in such a chaotic fashion that it ended up dividing the societies fundamentally.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the supercommittee's potential failure and the resulting sequester, and given Republican attempts to modify the automatic cuts, will you veto any such legislation? Furthermore, could you shed light on your 'hot mic' exchange with President Sarkozy regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu? [SEP] Regarding the supercommittee, we agreed back in August to a trillion dollars in cuts over the next ten years, primarily from discretionary spending. We also acknowledged that to achieve a more stable fiscal footing, we'd need at least another 1.2 trillion. The whole point of the sequester was to force both sides to move beyond their rigid stances and do what's best for the country. Since then, there have been many discussions, but it seems people are still clinging to their entrenched positions instead of finding solutions. I've put forward a comprehensive plan that would achieve over $3 trillion in savings, a balanced approach that the American people prefer. It means everything is on the table: discretionary spending cuts, non-defense and defense cuts, adjustments to entitlement programs, healthcare cost reductions, and additional revenue. When it comes to revenue, it makes sense to start by asking the wealthiest among us to pay a bit more before asking seniors to pay more for their Medicare. This is the same proposal I made to Speaker Boehner in August, a balanced approach that every independent committee has endorsed. It seems people keep trying to tweak the numbers to get a different outcome. But the equation remains the same: a balanced approach is essential to avoid crippling Medicare and Medicaid. I hope the congressional leadership on the supercommittee will step up and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change. I'm prepared to sign legislation that's balanced and solves the problem. As for the 'hot mic' incident in France, I won't comment on private conversations with other leaders. However, my main discussion with President Sarkozy revolved around my disappointment with France's vote in favor of Palestinian membership in UNESCO, which would require the US to cut funding, undermining direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. I had a very frank conversation with President Sarkozy about that issue, consistent with my previous statements.", "label": "Declining to answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Convalescent—convalescent plasma, as a treatment, has been around for, you know, a hundred years. You mentioned Warp—Operation Warp Speed, which enabled this process to move along a lot faster. What into the—what went into the effort for this to be approved for COVID-19? And was that holdup political in nature? [SEP] Well, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn't mind so much. That's my opinion—a very strong opinion. And that's for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics; this has to do with life and death.So we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright, and we have got some incredible answers.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning the dire situation in Syria, did your discussions with President Putin and President Hu yield any indication of their willingness for Assad to step down, and were any concrete steps agreed upon to halt the bloodshed? [SEP] Well, Syria was definitely a key topic in both meetings. The violence there is completely out of control, with civilians being targeted and Assad having lost all legitimacy. When you massacre your own citizens, it's impossible to imagine a peaceful transition that includes Assad. Now, achieving that transition is a complex matter. Russia, with its historical ties to Syria, and China, generally hesitant to interfere in other nations' internal affairs, have been reluctant to apply the necessary pressure. Our conversations were frank. While the U.S. and the international community aren't fully aligned with Russia and China on this, I believe they recognize the dangers of a full-blown civil war. I don't believe they condone the massacres, and they understand that a mechanism for ending the violence and establishing a legitimate government would benefit everyone. I've emphasized the importance of working with the UN and Kofi Annan on a political transition plan. Hopefully, we can continue these discussions and present a clear path forward to the Syrian people. However, it's premature to say that Russia and China are fully on board. They acknowledge the gravity of the situation and its negative impact on their interests and the Syrian people's. We all agree that helping the Syrian people find a resolution is in everyone's best interest. Personally, I don't see a scenario where Assad remains in power and the violence decreases. He failed to uphold his end of the Annan plan, leading to further escalation and the deaths of innocent civilians. Even the international monitors have had to withdraw due to the violence. While some argue that the opposition is also engaged in violence, the horrifying images from places like Homs are a direct result of the Syrian government's actions, for which Assad is ultimately responsible.", "label": "General"}

But when the media constantly twists my words and attacks me unfairly, I have to defend myself. It's a constant battle against misrepresentation.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. Just to belabor the point on that question, Mr. President, the—your people have said that the framework agreement, that what's in it stands, that they are not renegotiable points, although the implementation of them can be renegotiated in some way. And I wonder how, within that framework that's already been agreed, how we can come up with something that satisfies the kinds of concerns that he raised: no inspection of military sites, immediate lifting of all sanctions the day that the thing is signed.And also, on Cuba, I wanted to ask, as you discussed the state sponsor of terrorism list with President Castro, the Cubans have raised some issues about the 45-day waiting period. I wondered if that came up. I know that your government is eager, assuming that the recommendation is approved—is to remove it and is approved by you—that we move ahead quickly with Embassies. The Cubans have raised concerns about that 45 days and how something could go wrong in those 45 days. And it really doesn't give them access to the kinds of things they think they can have once the—they're—if and when they're removed from the list. Did that come up? And is it your belief that once they're removed from the list, then there is no impediment to go ahead with opening Embassies, once you approve their removal from the list? [SEP] Okay. So I'll make one last run at Iran here. There's a political framework, the outlines of which were established between Iran and the P-5-plus-1. In some cases, there was great specificity around, for example, the reductions that need to take place in the number of centrifuges in Natanz or the conversion of Fordow into a facility that does not permit the potential production of weapons-grade uranium. And in other cases, there were—there was language of intent, but the details matter. And how those details are interpreted are going to be subject to negotiation.So it's not accurate to suggest that—and I don't think my team has ever suggested that—somehow everything is all done and it's just a matter of writing it up. This is a situation in which we have a framework that is, if implemented, powerful and will achieve our goal of making sure that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. But the details make a big difference, how they're structured. And I guarantee you, there will be some tough negotiations around that.And that's what I said the first day when we announced that we had an agreement, and that's what we've continued to say. So there's really no contradiction here. And keep in mind that when we started this process off, even with the interim agreement, when we signed the JPOA way back at the beginning of this whole thing, there was a similar back-and-forth in terms of interpretation of how this was going to be implemented. And the Iranians were saying that's not true, and we were saying this. But once we actually got through the negotiations, it turned out that we had something that was substantial, that was subject to review by everybody involved, and that has proven to be highly effective, even by the assessments of critics of the policy like the Israelis. They've said, yes, this actually has worked, Iran has abided by the agreement. In fact, now they're suggesting, why don't we just stay here, it's worked so well, despite the fact that they had made almost the precise same argument they're making now about the final deal. But consistency is the hobgoblin of narrow minds.Cuba. I will tell you, we did not get into the level of detail, Karen, that you just described. And I'm impressed with how many details you seem to be aware of. [] As I said before, the state sponsor of terrorism recommendation will be coming to me. I will read it; I'll review it. There's a process whereby if in fact I accept those recommendations, Congress has an opportunity to review it as well, and it will be there for people to see.I think that the concerns around the Embassy are going to be mostly on the Cuban side. They haven't dealt with an American Embassy in Cuba in quite some time. And changing in this way is, I'm sure, an unsettling process. We're accustomed to this. I mean, we've gone through now a number of times where, with China and with Vietnam and other countries, we opened—reopened diplomatic relations, and we understand, I think, are familiar with, how that gets done in a way that's consistent with improving diplomatic relations over the long term. This is probably a more profound shift for them than it is for us.But we stand ready to move forward. We're confident that it can lead to an improved dialogue. And our bottom line in the end is, is that it can lead to an improved set of prospects for the Cuban people.And I'll say just in closing, to all the people here from Latin American countries, thank you for this extraordinary opportunity. I want to thank the people of Panama. I am very optimistic about this region, and the main reason I'm optimistic about this region is because of its people. They are extraordinary.

[SEP] Well, it's a true statement already. We have more testing than any country in the world by far. But I'll let Admiral go into a little bit of the future. When you look at the testing numbers that we worked with collaboratively with the State leadership—it's not just with the Governor, but the State health officers, the State epidemiologists, the public health labs—it's really a combination of testing those who need something for diagnosis, diagnostic testing; tracing—so testing those who have been around the people with a diagnosis.[]The other thing I would say is, particularly as we move into the summer, there are surveillance mechanisms—and I talked about them before—like a weather radar.

But let's be real: things have changed east of NATO's borders. We're dealing with aggression, armed aggression, against a neighbor. Remember Georgia? Now it's Ukraine, especially Crimea. Putin hasn't exactly been secretive about Russian forces being involved. We have to recognize that, just like Russia hasn't hidden the fact that they've doubled their defense budget in the last four years. We've got to ask ourselves, why? What's the end game? What does it mean for NATO countries? We all want Russia to modernize, so we can do good business, be good neighbors, and work together in lots of different areas. But right now, we have to deal with this situation by backing Ukraine's independence and their right to choose a pro-Western path. We also need to support Ukraine's modernization. I think that's the right way to go, a good example for Russian society, just like Poland's democracy, free market, prosperity, and security were a good example. It had a positive effect on Ukraine, and I think it was part of their dream to follow the same path, towards the same values. I'm also convinced that if Ukraine is successful, democratic, and independent, and if they can overcome their economic and political problems, it will have a big impact on how people in Russia think.

If Russia targets groups aligned with the U.S., will the U.S. provide protection? And regarding the train-and-equip program, can it be reformed, or should we explore alternatives like a no-fly zone? [SEP] Well, let's be clear about Syria. It started with peaceful protests against Assad, which were met with unacceptable brutality, leading to a civil war. This isn't a U.S. conflict; it's the Syrian people against a ruthless dictator. Russia and Iran have supported Assad all along, so their current actions are just more blatant. I told Putin that the only way forward is a political transition that includes everyone except Assad. I'm open to working with Russia if they can facilitate this transition, but a military solution is not viable. We share a common goal of defeating ISIS, but Putin's failure to distinguish between ISIS and the moderate opposition is a critical error. We're engaged in technical discussions to prevent aerial conflicts. Regarding our support for opposition groups, they are essential for a future political transition. The train-and-equip program hasn't met expectations because of their focus on Assad's attacks. We're assessing successful strategies, such as our collaboration with the Kurds. Putin's intervention in Syria is a sign of weakness, not strength. His coalition is limited to Iran and Assad, while ours encompasses the rest of the world.

I'm wondering, sir, if you believe that health care reform, that you worked so hard on, is in danger at this point and whether there's a threat as a result of this election? [SEP] Well, I know that there's some Republican candidates who won last night who feel very strongly about it. I'm sure that this will be an issue that comes up in discussions with the Republican leadership. As I said before, though, I think we'd be misreading the election if we thought that the American people want to see us for the next 2 years relitigate arguments that we had over the last 2 years.With respect to the health care law, generally--and this may go to some of the questions that Savannah was raising. When I talk to a woman from New Hampshire who doesn't have to mortgage her house because she got cancer and is seeking treatment, but now is able to get health insurance; when I talk to parents who are relieved that their child with a preexisting condition can now stay on their policy until they're 26 years old and give them a time to transition to find a job that will give them health insurance, or the small businesses that are now taking advantage of the tax credits that are provided, then I say to myself, this was the right thing to do.Now, if the Republicans have ideas for how to improve our health care system, if they want to suggest modifications that would deliver faster and more effective reform to a health care system that has been wildly expensive for too many families and businesses and certainly for our Federal Government, I'm happy to consider some of those ideas.For example, I know one of the things that's come up is that the 1099 provision in the health care bill appears to be too burdensome for small businesses. It just involves too much paperwork, too much filing. It's probably counterproductive. It was designed to make sure that revenue was raised to help pay for some of the other provisions, but if it ends up just being so much trouble that small businesses find it difficult to manage, that's something that we should take a look at.So there are going to be examples where I think we can tweak and make improvements on the progress that we've made. That's true for any significant piece of legislation.But I don't think that if you ask the American people, should we stop trying to close the doughnut hole, that will help senior citizens get prescription drugs? Should we go back to a situation where people with preexisting conditions can't get health insurance?

{"sentence": "Q. Is it fair to say that additional military personnel—U.S. military personnel are part of what's under consideration? [SEP] I think what is fair to say is that all the countries in the international coalition are prepared to do more to train Iraqi security forces if they feel like that additional work is being taken advantage of. And one of the things that we're still seeing is, in Iraq, places where we've got more training capacity than we have recruits. So part of my discussion with Prime Minister Abadi was, how do we make sure that we get more recruits in? A big part of the answer there is our outreach to Sunni tribes.We've seen Sunni tribes who are not only willing and prepared to fight ISIL, but have been successful at rebuffing ISIL. But it has not been happening as fast as it needs to. And so one of the efforts that I'm hoping to see out of Prime Minister Abadi and the Iraqi legislature when they're in session is to move forward on a National Guard law that would help to devolve some of the security efforts in places like Anbar to local folks and to get those Sunni tribes involved more rapidly.This is part of what helped defeat AQI—the precursor of ISIL—during the Iraq war in 2006. Without that kind of local participation, even if you have a short-term success, it's very hard to hold those areas.The other area where we've got to make a lot more progress is on stemming the flow of foreign fighters. Now, you'll recall that I hosted a U.N. General Security Council meeting specifically on this issue, and we've made some progress, but not enough. We are still seeing thousands of foreign fighters flowing into, first, Syria, and then, oftentimes, ultimately into Iraq.And not all of that is preventable, but a lot of it is preventable, if we've got better cooperation, better coordination, better intelligence, if we are monitoring what's happening at the Turkish-Syria border more effectively. This is an area where we've been seeking deeper cooperation with Turkish authorities, who recognize it's a problem but haven't fully ramped up the capacity they need. And this is something that I think we got to spend a lot of time on.If we can cut off some of that foreign fighter flow, then we're able to isolate and wear out ISIL forces that are already there. Because we're taking a lot of them off the battlefield, but if they're being replenished, then it doesn't solve the problem over the long term.The final point that I emphasized to Prime Minister Abadi is the political agenda of inclusion remains as important as the military fight that's out there. If Sunnis, Kurds, and Shia all feel as if their concerns are being addressed and that operating within a legitimate political structure can meet their need for security, prosperity, nondiscrimination, then we're going to have a much easier time.And Prime—the good news is, Prime Minister Abadi is very much committed to that principle. But obviously, he's inheriting a legacy of a lot of mistrust between various groups in Iraq. He's having to take a lot of political risks. In some cases, there are efforts to undermine those efforts by other political factions within Iraq.

{"sentence": "Q. Okay. My question is very simple. You mentioned interpretation. I know part of the difficulty being the American President is that some of the decisions that you take, actions you make will be interpreted in a way that are not what you thought they would be or what you meant they would be. For instance, some of the actions you've taken were interpreted as antibusiness domestically in the United States. And as someone just mentioned, some of the actions taken by the U.S. Government that you represent as well were interpreted as sacrificing other countries' interests for America's own benefit. So it's--you find yourself constantly being interpreted in a thousand different ways. How do you address these interpretations? [SEP] With wonderful press conference like this that give me the opportunity, hopefully, to provide my own interpretation. But look, you make a valid point. We live in a connected world. Everything I say, everything my administration does, anything one of my aides does is interpreted in one fashion or another. In America, we call it spin. And there's a spin cycle that is going on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And I think that in this media environment, it is in some ways more challenging to make sure that your message and your intentions are getting out in a consistent basis.But I think that if I'm consistent with my actions and I'm consistent with my goals, then over time, hopefully, people look at my overall trajectory and they can draw accurate conclusions about what we're trying to do.With respect to business, for example, we've had in the United States some battles between myself and some in the business community around issues like financial regulation or health care. At the same time, I've said repeatedly and I said on this trip, we can't succeed unless American businesses succeed. And I'm going to do everything I can to promote their ability to grow and prosper and to sell their goods both in the United States and abroad. And the fact that the economy is now growing and trade is expanding and the stock market is up, I think, is an indication that I mean what I say. And hopefully, by the end of my administration businesses will look back and say, you know what, actually the guy was pretty good for business, even if at any given point in the road they may be frustrated.So all right, now I'm stuck with this last one, but I think I've got to go fly a plane.", "label": "Explicit"}

The United States cannot impose a solution to these problems, but I've indicated to Prime Minister Singh that we are happy to play any role that the parties think is appropriate in reducing these tensions. That's in the interests of the region, it's in the interests of the two countries involved, and it's in the interests of the United States of America.So my hope is that conversations will be taking place between the two countries.

It wasn't just my opinion; there was broad consensus. Instead, we've focused on innovation and technology, and we've actually reduced greenhouse gases while growing our economy. As for Mr. Howard's efforts, I support addressing climate change, but we need a global approach that includes everyone, including countries like China and India.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Anybody on Capitol Hill will say that there's no chance that the American Jobs Act, in its current state, passes either House. And you've been out on the campaign trail banging away at them saying, pass this bill. And it begins, sir, to look like you're campaigning and like you're following the Harry Truman model against the do-nothing Congress instead of negotiating. Are you negotiating? Will you? [SEP] I am always open to negotiations. What is also true is they need to do something. I'm not--look, the--Bill, I think it is very clear that if Members of Congress come in and say, All right, we want to build infrastructure, here's the way we think we can do it; we want to put construction workers back to work, we've got some ideas, I am ready, eager to work with them. They say, We've got this great idea for putting teachers back in the classroom; it's a little different than what you've proposed in the jobs bill. I'm ready, eager to work with them. But that's not what we're hearing right now. I mean, what we're hearing is that their big ideas, the ones that make sense, are ones we're already doing.They've given me a list of, well, here's the Republican job creation ideas: Let's pass free trade agreements. It's great that we're passing these free trade agreements. We put them forward; I expect bipartisan support. I think it's going to be good for the American economy. But it's not going to meet the challenge of 9-percent unemployment or an economy that is currently weakening. It's not enough.Patent reform, very important for our long-term competitiveness. There's nobody out there who actually thinks that that's going to immediately fill the needs of people who are out of work or strengthen the economy right now.So what I've tried to do is say, here are the best ideas I've heard. Not just from partisans, but from independent economists. These are the ideas most likely to create jobs now and strengthen the economy right now. And that's what the American people are looking for. And the response from Republicans has been, no, although they haven't given a good reason why they're opposed to putting construction workers back on the job or teachers back in the classroom.If you ask them, well, okay, if you're not for that, what are you for? Trade has already been done; patent reform has been done. What else? The answer we're getting right now is, well, we're going to roll back all these Obama regulations. So their big economic plan to put people back to work right now is to roll back financial protections and allow banks to charge hidden fees on credit cards again or weaken consumer watchdogs. Or alternatively, they've said we'll roll back regulations that make sure we've got clean air and clean water, eliminate the EPA. Does anybody really think that that is going to create jobs right now and meet the challenges of a global economy that are--that is weakening with all these forces coming into play?I mean, here is a good question, here's a little homework assignment for folks: Go ask the Republicans what their jobs plan is, if they're opposed to the American Jobs Act, and have it scored, have it assessed by the same independent economists that have assessed our jobs plan. These independent economists say that we could grow the economy as much as 2 percent and as many as 1.9 million workers would be back on the job. I think it would be interesting to have them do a similar assessment--same people. Some of these folks, by the way, traditionally have worked for Republicans, not just Democrats. Have those economists evaluate what, over the next 2 years, the Republican jobs plan would do. I'll be interested in the answer. I think everybody here--I see some smirks in the audience because you know that it's not going to be real robust.And so, Bill, the question, then, is, will Congress do something? If Congress does something, then I can't run against a do-nothing Congress. If Congress does nothing, then it's not a matter of me running against them; I think the American people will run them out of town because they are frustrated, and they know we need to do something big and something bold.Now, the American people are also concerned about making sure that we have a Government that lives within its means, which is why I put forward a plan that would also reduce our deficit and our debt in a more aggressive way than what the special committee has been charged with.Folks want to talk about corporate tax reform. I've already said I'm happy to engage with them on corporate tax reform. I'm happy to engage with them, working to see what we can do to streamline and simplify our Tax Code, eliminate all the loopholes, eliminate these special interest carve-outs and potentially lower rates in the process while raising more revenue.I am happy to negotiate with them on a whole host of issues, but right now we've got an emergency. And the American people are living that emergency out every single day, and they have been for a long time. They are working really hard. And if they're not on the job, then they're working really hard to find a job. And they're losing their homes, and their kids are having to drop out of school because they can't afford student loans. And they're putting off visiting a doctor because when they lost their job they lost their health insurance. They are struggling.And as a consequence, by the way, all of us are struggling, even those who are well off. The irony is the same folks that the Republicans claim to be protecting, the well off--the millionaires and the billionaires--they'd be doing better, they'd be making more money if ordinary Americans had some money in their pockets and were out there feeling more confident about the economy. That's been the lesson of our history: When folks in the middle and at the bottom are doing well, the folks at the top do even better.", "label": "General"}

We believe the best way to achieve this is to collaborate with Egypt to halt the flow of arms into Gaza, which enables Hamas to continue their rocket attacks. Countries supplying these weapons must cease their support. The international community must maintain pressure on them to stop providing arms. Hamas, of course, if they genuinely desire a sustainable ceasefire, must stop arming themselves. And neighboring countries must work together to prevent smuggling.

{"sentence": "Q. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that you have a situation where Iran can delay 24 days before giving access to military facilities—— The President. I'm happy to—that's a good example. So let's take the issue of 24 days. This has been, I think, swirling today, the notion that this is insufficient in terms of inspections.Now, keep in mind, first of all, that we'll have 24/7 inspections of declared nuclear facilities—Fordow, Natanz, Arak, their uranium mines; facilities that are known to produce centrifuges, parts. That entire infrastructure that we know about, we will have sophisticated, 24/7 monitoring of those facilities. Okay?So then, the issue is, what if they try to develop a covert program? Now, one of the advantages of having inspections across the entire production chain is that it makes it very difficult to set up a covert program. There are only so many uranium mines in Iran. And if in fact we're counting the amount of uranium that's being mined and suddenly some is missing on the back end, they've got some explaining to do.So we're able to track what's happening along the existing facilities to make sure that there is not diversion into a covert program. But let's say that Iran is so determined that it now wants to operate covertly. The IAEA—the international organization charged with implementing the nonproliferation treaty and monitoring nuclear activities in countries around the world—the IAEA will have the ability to say, that undeclared site we're concerned about, we see something suspicious. And they will be able to say to Iran, we want to go inspect that.Now, if Iran objects, we can override it. In the agreement, we've set it up so we can override Iran's objection. And we don't need Russia or China in order for us to get that override. And if they continue to object, we're in a position to snap back sanctions and declare that Iran is in violation and is cheating.As for the fact that it may take 24 days to finally get access to the site, the nature of nuclear programs and facilities is such, this is not something you hide in a closet. This is not something you put on a dolly and kind of wheel off somewhere. And by the way, if we identify an undeclared site that we're suspicious about, we're going to be keeping eyes on it. So we're going to be monitoring what the activity is, and that's going to be something that will be evidence, if we think that some funny business was going on there, that we can then present to the international community.So we'll be monitoring that that entire time. And by the way, if there is nuclear material on that site, your high school physics will remind us that that leaves a trace. And so we'll know that, in fact, there was a violation of the agreement.So the point is, Jonathan, that this is the most vigorous inspection and verification regime by far that has ever been negotiated. Is it possible that Iran decides to try to cheat despite having this entire inspection verification mechanism? It's possible. But if it does, first of all, we've built in a 1-year breakout time, which gives us a year to respond forcefully. And we've built in a snap-back provision so we don't have to go through lengthy negotiations at the U.N. to put the sanctions right back in place.And so really the only argument you can make against the verification and inspection mechanism that we've put forward is that Iran is so intent on obtaining a nuclear weapon that no inspection regime and no verification mechanism would be sufficient because they'd find some way to get around it because they're untrustworthy.And if that's your view, then we go back to the choice that you have to make earlier. That means, presumably, that you can't negotiate. And what you're really saying is, is that you've got to apply military force to guarantee that they don't have a nuclear program. And if somebody wants to make that debate, whether it's the Republican leadership or Prime Minister Netanyahu or the Israeli Ambassador or others, they're free to make it.

Taking a look at your budget, there are tax hikes proposed for energy, for higher income people, and also for replenishing the State unemployment funds. Do you worry about the impact on jobs, sir? [SEP] Well, actually, if you look at that budget, there's a whole bunch of stuff in there for job creation. I think some folks noted, for example, our infrastructure proposals, which would create millions of jobs around the country; our investments in research and development and clean energy have the potential for creating job growth in industries of the future.My belief that the high-end tax cuts for--or the Bush tax cuts for the high end of the population--folks like me--my belief is, is that that doesn't in any way impede job growth. And most economists agree.We had this debate in December. Now, we compromised in order to achieve an overall package that reduced taxes for all Americans, and so I believe--I continue to believe that was a smart compromise. But when it comes to over the long term, maintaining tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, when that will mean additional deficits of a trillion dollars, if you're serious about deficit reduction, you don't do that.And as I said, I think most economists--even ones that tend to lean to the right or are more conservative--would agree that that's not the best way for us to approach deficit reduction and debt reduction.So I do think it's important, as we think about corporate tax reform, as we think about individual tax reform, to try to keep taxes as simple as possible and as low as possible. But we also have to acknowledge that, in the same way that families have to pay for what they buy, well, Government has to pay for what it buys. And if we believe that it's important for us to have a strong military, that doesn't come for free. We've got to pay for it. If we think that we have to take care of our veterans when they come home--and not just salute on Memorial Day, but we actually have to work with folks who have posttraumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury--well, that requires services that are very labor intensive and expensive.If we think it's important that our senior citizens continue to enjoy health care in their golden years, that costs money. If we think that after a flood, we help out our neighbors and our fellow citizens so that they can recover, we've got to pay for it.So the circumstance that's changed--earlier Julianna asked why I think I might get a deal.

I think it is important for all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence, if we're moving forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care, that there is complete transparency and all these issues have been adequately vetted and adequately debated.And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say, here's what we think we should do, but it also gives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say, here's our plan, here's why we think this will work.

Despite past problems with trade deals, my approach is right for big, medium, and small businesses, and especially American workers. I wouldn't promote any deal that didn't create jobs and higher wages. The issue with Elizabeth isn't personal. It's fun for the press, but we're close allies with a policy disagreement.

I really don't want to put the situation—listen, let me put it this way: I want to make sure that in the ian issue that the whole world stays engaged, because I believe that's a more effective way of convincing the ians that—to give up their nuclear weapons ambitions. That's why.Look, I know this is a world in which— and I'm not suggesting you're this way— but this is a world in which people say, Meet, sit down and meet. And my answer is, If it yields results, that's what I'm interested in. And so I believe the strategy that—and by the way, I remember this during the North Korean issue, debate. People kept saying, Well, all you've got to do is sit down with the guy. And I kept saying, Well, I think it's going to be more effective if we have other people at the table with us saying the same thing, so that just in case he decides not to honor the agreement, there will be other people saying the same thing I'll say, which is, ‘You said one thing; you did another.'

It sounds tempting for somebody to say, All you've got to do is sit down with the people. I'm in a little different position in that I'm trying to achieve certain objectives. And we are making progress on the ian issue. If you step back to early on in the process, there was doubt as to whether or not the world would come together, sometimes because of the reason John mentioned, in other words, the conflicting interests. And I believe we are making good progress toward solving this issue peacefully.And we'll continue to try to solve the issue peacefully. It's an important issue whether or not ends up with a nuclear weapon. It's one of these issues that people are going to look back and say: You know, how come they couldn't see the impending danger? What happened to them? You've heard me say that often about what would happen if we don't—if we were to abandon our efforts in the Middle East for stability and peace through forms of government that are more likely to defeat an extremist ideology that would like to be able to prevail.And it's a—at any rate, that's why I made the decision I made. Presidents have to weigh different options all the time. Look, I fully understand there are some who are—don't agree with every decision I make.

Have you flatly ruled out opening a Government investigation into the events around the release of the bomber?And, President Obama, how do you feel about a congressional investigation into this? Would you like to see that happen, or do you think that confuses the two events? [SEP] Well, why don't I start off, and I'll throw it over to David. I think all of us here in the United States were surprised, disappointed, and angry about the release of the Lockerbie bomber. And my administration expressed very clearly our objections prior to the decision being made and subsequent to the decision being made. So we welcome any additional information that will give us insights and a better understanding of why the decision was made.But I think that the key thing to understand here is that we've got a British Prime Minister who shares our anger over the decision, who also objects to how it played out. And so I'm fully supportive of Prime Minister Cameron's efforts to gain a better understanding of it, to clarify it. But the bottom line is, is that we all disagreed with it. It was a bad decision. And going forward, that has to inform how we approach our relationship with respect to counterterrorism generally.Now, one of the things that I want to emphasize that I think may get lost in this current debate is the extraordinarily strong ties between our two countries when it comes to fighting terrorism. We probably have the best coordination and cooperation of any two countries in the world. And those relationships are vital, and they keep people safe on both sides of the Atlantic.And I want to make sure that even as we may express concern about what happened with respect to the release of this particular individual, that we stay focused on the cooperation that currently exists and build on that cooperation to make sure that there is no diminution of our joint efforts to make sure that the kinds of attacks that happened over Lockerbie do not happen again. Well, I agree with actually what's been said about the importance of the security cooperation, something we discussed today. On Megrahi, look, I'm not standing here today and saying it was a bad decision to release Megrahi because I'm here. I said this a year ago, at the time, that it was a bad decision. It shouldn't have been made. The British Government, as well, should have been clear that it was a bad decision, rather than going along with it. I took that very clear view. This was the biggest mass murderer in British history, and there was no business in letting him out of prison.In terms of an inquiry, there has been an inquiry by the Scottish Parliament into the way the decision was made. The British Government--the last British Government released a whole heap of information about this decision. But I've asked the Cabinet Secretary today to go back through all of the paperwork and see if more needs to be published about the background to this decision.But in terms of an inquiry, I'm not currently minded that we need to have a U.K.-based inquiry on this, partly for this reason: I don't need an inquiry to tell me what was a bad decision. It was a bad decision. And if you like, the big fact that's changed over the year that makes it an even worse decision is the fact that, of course, Megrahi is still free, at liberty, in Libya, rather than serving the prison sentence in Scotland, as he should be doing.So that's what we're going to do, is go back over this information, see if more needs to be published, and of course, in terms of the congressional hearing, make sure that proper cooperation is extended to it.

As a result of these disclosures, countries that actively engage in the very activities that Mr. Snowden claims to be concerned about—such as surveillance of their own citizens, targeting political dissidents, and suppressing the press—are now able to stand on the sidelines and portray the United States as having problems with surveillance and intelligence operations. This is a distorted view of the situation. While this debate has been important and necessary, it is also crucial to remember that it has caused unnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and U.S. diplomacy. However, I will leave it to the courts and the Attorney General to publicly weigh in on the specifics of Mr. Snowden's case.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

[SEP] The Senate's Gang of Eight produced a commendable immigration bill. While not precisely what I'd have authored, it addresses key elements: improved border security, employer accountability, a more efficient legal immigration system, and a challenging but attainable path to citizenship. I'll carefully consider the House proposal, evaluating whether it meets these same fundamental requirements. Regarding Mexico, I look forward to engaging with President Peña Nieto to bolster our economic ties while addressing security challenges.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding your authority to ease sanctions to finalize the agreement, could you clarify the extent of your unilateral power? [SEP] Look, we're talking about a tiered system here. We've got international sanctions, UN resolutions, and then sanctions that we, the United States, have put in place ourselves. Each one operates under a different framework. But let's not jump the gun. First, we need to secure a deal. If we can get a verifiable agreement that prevents Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, an agreement that inspires confidence both here and abroad, then we'll bring it to Congress. We'll make the case that this is the best path forward, far better than military intervention or any other option. But it has to be a solid deal. I've always said, no deal is better than a bad deal. We can't lift sanctions and legitimize Iran without ironclad guarantees that they won't pursue nuclear weapons. Got it? Okay, next question.", "label": "Deflection"}

Has your perspective on him changed, and if he invades, would you consider a containment approach? [SEP] I maintain that he doesn't desire a full-scale war. However, I anticipate he will test the limits of the West, the United States, and NATO as much as he can. He will suffer significant repercussions that he doesn't presently foresee. He will regret his decision. He sees the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the loss of the Soviet empire as a major setback for Russia. He controls vast territory, but is struggling to establish his role between China and the West. I'm unsure if he has a definitive strategy. My expectation is that he will intervene. He feels compelled to act. He wants guarantees that Ukraine will never be part of NATO and that strategic weapons will not be stationed there. We can potentially reach an agreement on the latter, depending on his actions. The former is more challenging, as international agreements guarantee the right of nations to choose their alliances. However, Ukraine joining NATO in the near future is unlikely. There's room for negotiation if he's willing. But I think, as usual, he's going to—well, I probably shouldn't go any further.

Secretary Paulson's plan is a targeted intervention designed to address specific vulnerabilities. It's not a blank check. It's a responsible approach to managing risk.

They saved their money when copper prices were high, so they had the resources to weather the storm. A lesson for us, frankly. We squandered our surpluses.

We're also making strides in cancer research exchanges. Our trade relationship with Chile is strong. And Chile has partnerships with states like California.

{"sentence": "Q. Sure. Sure. But can you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work?And then for you, Mr. President, you mentioned the drop in the poverty rate. Specifically, we noticed at—just the news that the poverty rate for African Americans hit historic lows, that the household wealth increased historically for African Americans. What was driving that increase in wealth for African Americans?And now, in 2020, with the coronavirus, with unemployment spiking, what would be your plan for the second term to improve lives for African Americans? [SEP] Well, I'll go first, because of your question—I appreciate your question. And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our Nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in. And it's because the African American community, the Black community has had the lowest—the best employment numbers that we've ever had—both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it.But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just 6 months ago.And yes, the—I'm very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans—they had the best numbers they've ever had, by far—both employment and unemployment, depending on definition.Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that too? Okay. Yes, so what I—to clarify, I said that the first prioritization is the high-risk people and frontline health care workers.But just to reiterate, what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution for vaccination, and there's over 14,000 Federally ualified Health Centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So that's a focus.And I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high—there's a higher morbidity with—in certain ethnic groups.And last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous—an egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine, because there is no shortcut here. Everything is safe. Everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt is a particularly, you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risk.And so I implore everyone who is in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine. . I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely November 3. Once they heard that, the Democrats started—just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with a vaccine, it was totally made up. It's all disinformation.Just like they put an ad in about football. Just like they put—with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back. And I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous that Big Ten and now, hopefully, Pac-10 [Pac-12]* goes back.And I say that, just like—even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made-up story. It was a made-up story by a third-rate magazine, where the head guy—I guess, the head person—I have no idea who he is; I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton. So they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too.This story is very simple: They started knocking the vaccine as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now, it may or may not, but it will be within a matter of weeks. It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go and it's ready to—for massive distribution to everybody—with a focus, again, on seniors.And I will say, also, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are doing, at my suggestion—because they have had a difficult problem there—we are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.But we—when you look at what we've done on testing, in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon, in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests.Now what that does do is, it shows up more cases. If we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test; they don't have cases. And then they say, Oh, the United States—well—but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people.

My assessment is that while there's been some movement, it's not enough. This is a tough situation, complicated by years of tyranny that bred distrust. These leaders need to build trust. They're learning how to lead democratically, which is a new process. Yes, they haven't passed all the laws we expected, and that's where the focus often is. But there's also a Presidency Council, representing different parties, working through these challenges. The July 15th report to Congress showed they met about half the benchmarks, falling short on some political ones. Interestingly, their parliament has passed around 60 laws this year, some directly related to reconciliation, like judicial reform and dismantling Saddam's laws. People ask, 'Is there even a functioning government?' I asked about the budgeting process – is there a central system for oil revenues? About 97% of their revenue comes from oil, and they're using it for military operations and expenses. But there's also revenue sharing with the provinces, which surprised me, given the impression of total dysfunction. In 2006, the central government allocated $2.3 billion to the provinces, benefiting Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish regions. Some of this money is being better spent now thanks to bottom-up reconciliation efforts. The point is, there's still a lot of work to be done. If you look hard enough, you'll find evidence that the government is learning to function. We need an oil revenue sharing law, but revenue sharing is already happening. The fundamental question for America is: is it worth it? Does it matter if we stay long enough for an ally to emerge in the fight against radicals? My answer is yes.

You've made progress. But I know that there have been some differences between the U.S. and Italy over the months, even though the friendship is solid and progress has been made. So President Bush is asking you to perhaps change your rules of engagement in Afghanistan, and even with regard to Iran, there are some differences of opinion and, in general, in the Middle East. So have you managed to close that gap a bit? Or how do you think you might be doing that in the future? [SEP] Yes, I'm going to have coffee with the former Prime Minister, Prime Minister Berlusconi. I'm doing so for a couple of reasons: One, he is the opposition leader; two, he is a friend. And I mentioned this to Romano, and his attitude was, I don't blame you; it's the kind of thing he does when he goes to other countries. And I'm looking forward to seeing Silvio. It's a—one shouldn't read anything into it, other than we made some decisions together. We've known each other for a while, just like I've known Romano— actually, I've known Romano a long time too. He was President of the EU early on in my Presidency. And so I consider it an honor to have friends with two important leaders here in Italy. We spoke very frankly about many of the issues that you've just raised in your question. And, yes, there certainly is an active cooperation between us. And this is with regard to problems we've had in Afghanistan and, of course, the very difficult situation in Iran. And we both share the same position, the same views when—with regard to the danger that we are running if we allow the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and we also agree on the course of action that should be followed.So I think that in the future we'll certainly be able to work together, and we'll be able to exert pressure, both of us, on the Iranian Government. We don't want them to exceed the limits, as it were, of a peaceful and monitored or controlled use of nuclear technology. So, this is our position, and, as I said, we share the same view.Now, of course, we also discussed other issues on our common agenda, and we were able to reiterate the fact that there is an interdependence here and a need to work together, not only because it is helpful or useful, but it is a strong need that we have to focus on to restore peace in the world.Now, we spoke about climate change, about global warming in our meetings over the past few days. And I think that this has somehow set out a course of action for the future: how we can perhaps harmonize our production systems; how we can make sure that our political decisions are, in fact, in conformity with these needs.

But yesterday Emmanuel Macron said that the Inflation Reduction Act is, in fact, superaggressive, I quote, toward European companies. Does that mean that you are ready to grant exception—exemptions of the regulations to European industries?And now my question to you, Monsieur President.[The reporter spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Mr. President, will you leave Washington with the assurance that you will be able to deal with these massive—[inaudible]?Interpreter. The journalist doesn't have a microphone. Q. Do you think there is risk of generating divisions? [SEP] I'll answer the last question, since I didn't hear any of it. I didn't understand a word of it, so I'll answer it. [][] Can we take care of it? [] No, look, the United States makes no apology—and I make no apologies, since I wrote it for—the legislation you're talking about.But there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation—and that has almost $368 billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all—of all of history. And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it.For example, there's a provision in it that says that there is the exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. Well, that was added by a Member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just meant allies; he didn't mean, literally, free trade agreement. So there's a lot we can work out.But the essence of it is, we're going to make sure that the United States continues—and just as I hope Europe will be able to continue—not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain. We're—we are our own supply chain, and we share that with Europe and all of our allies. And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing.So there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and/or be on their own. But that is something that is a matter to be worked out.There is no fundamental—it was never intended, when I wrote the legislation—I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us. That was not the intention.The intention was to make sure we no longer were in a position—when there was a pandemic in Asia, and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. We invented the damn things, you know? []So it's—anyway—but my point is, we're back in business, Europe is back in business, and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.[.] What we've been discussing with President Biden and what, as a matter of fact, he just said—and that's what I talked about with the caucus yesterday—that simple: The United States of America adopted a piece of legislation for their country, for their industry, which—with a common objective, goal that we share: creating jobs, creating opportunities for the middle class, and succeeding in implementing the energy transition.The reality is that the consequences, as we've seen in our discussions—it is certainly not the intention of the United States, but, as a matter of fact, projects that were growing—being developed in Europe, there's such a difference in subsidies that these projects might come to an end.And a number of Senators, yesterday, like—said it was certainly not their intention. So France simply did not come to ask for an exemption or another for our economy, but simply to discuss the consequences of this legislation.And the news—the circumstances mean that we have no alternative, but to work together. So, therefore, I believe we need to resynchronize, as I say, find a new policy to clarify our goals and continue together. And the discussion we had this morning was extremely clear. And I could feel the very same intent on behalf of the Members of the Congress yesterday.And the wish of President Biden is to rebuild a strong industry here and to have somehow to secure some technology solutions for the future. France wishes exactly the same thing for itself. And we're—we've been fighting, day in, day out, to do the very same thing in our country. And this will enable us to put an end to some 15 years of industry loss in our country and to have new manufacturing jobs.And so we'll be working on that. And we decided to do that together with the other members of the European Union and the European Commission. So we will work on the technical elements to make sure that there is no domino effect on ongoing projects in Europe. We want to succeed together, not one against the other.It's been clear.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Ma'am. This is Mark Riley from 7News, Australia. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the other rising giant of our region, India. And the Prime Minister might like to add some comments. How significant is it for the U.S. that Australia is now considering selling uranium to India? And could you clear up for us what influence or encouragement your administration gave Australia as it made that decision?And also, the decision is so India can produce clean energy. In that regard, you're aware that our Parliament has passed a new bill pricing carbon, a carbon tax, if you like. But we're intrigued about where America is going on this issue. And countries like Australia don't see a carbon trading system in the world working unless America is a big part of it. Can you tell us, is it your wish that American will have an emissions trading scheme across the Nation within the next 5 years or so? How heavily do you want to see America involved in an emissions trading scheme globally? Or has this become too politically hard for you? [SEP] Good. Well, first of all, with respect to India, we have not had any influence, I suspect, on Australia's decision to explore what its relationship in terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in India might be. I suspect that you've got some pretty smart Government officials here who figured out that India is a big player and that the Australia-India relationship is one that should be cultivated. So they--I don't think Julia or anybody else needs my advice in figuring that out. This is part of your neighborhood, and you are going to make bilateral decisions about how to move forward.I think, without wading into the details, the discussions that are currently taking place here in Australia around that relationship and the nuclear issue with India are ones that are compatible with international law, compatible with decisions that were made in the NPT. And I will watch with interest what's determined. But this is not something between the United States and Australia, this is something between India and Australia.With respect to carbon emissions, I think I share the view of your Prime Minister and most scientists in the world that climate change is a real problem and that human activity is contributing to it and that we all have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions.Each country is trying to figure out how to do that most effectively. Here in Australia, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, you've moved forward with a bold strategy. In the United States, although we haven't passed a what we call a cap-and-trade system, an exchange, what we have done is, for example, taken steps to double fuel efficiency standard on cars, which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.We've invested heavily in clean energy research. We believe very strongly that with improved efficiencies and a whole step--a whole range of steps that we can meet and the commitments that we made in Copenhagen and Cancun. And as we move forward over the next several years, my hope is, is that the United States, as one of several countries with a big carbon footprint, can find further ways to reduce our carbon emissions. I think that's good for the world. I actually think, over the long term, it's good for our economies as well, because it's my strong belief that industries, utilities, individual consumers, we're all going to have to adapt how we use energy and how we think about carbon.Now, another belief that I think the Prime Minister and I share is that the advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora--and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban--is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain. It doesn't mean that they have to do exactly what we do. We understand that in terms of per capita carbon emissions, they've got a long way to go before they catch up to us. But it does mean that they've got to take seriously their responsibilities as well.And so ultimately, what we want is a mechanism whereby all countries are making an effort. And it's going to be a tough slog, particularly at a time when the economies are--a lot of economies are still struggling. But I think it's actually one that over the long term can be beneficial.Jackie Calmes [New York Times].", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In your opening remarks, you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work, it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumer spending or overspending how we got into this mess? And if people get money back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or paying down debt first before they start spending money into the economy? [SEP] Well, first of all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What got us into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies based on shaky assets. And because of the enormous leverage where they had $1 worth of assets and they were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in the financial system. That led to a contraction of credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meant that everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy, so people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investment, initiated layoffs, which in turn made things worse.Now, you are making a legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined and this economy has been driven by consumer spending for a very long time, and that's not going to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending, and we're not making things, then over time other countries are going to get tired of lending us money and eventually the party is going to be over. Well, in fact, the party now is over.And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows: Our immediate job is to stop the downward spiral, and that means putting money into consumers' pockets, it means loosening up credit, it means putting forward investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth. And that, by the way, is important even if you're a fiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have with our Federal budget is if we continue a situation in which there are no tax revenues because economic growth is plummeting at the same time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance, we've got more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the Federal budget as well as the State budget.So the most important thing we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the economic recovery plan is the right thing to do, even though I recognize that it's expensive. Look, I would love not to have to spend money right now. I'd--this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, that wasn't how I envisioned my Presidency beginning, but we have to adapt to existing circumstances.Now, what we are going to also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we're no longer contracting but we're growing; that our mid-term and long-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true for individual consumers. Right now they're just trying to figure out, how do I make sure that if I lose my job, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments. Or they're worried about how am I going to pay next month's bills. So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financial planning.Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a free lunch. So if you want to get--if you want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably not affordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has to be reconsidered.So we're going to have to change our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out of the economic slump that we're in.All right. Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. At the stakeout, the Republicans were saying: Well, the jobs package we've seen, it's not really ready yet. We're a little worried about the cost. Are you satisfied that there is something that can be quickly moved through Congress on jobs? [SEP] Well, my understanding is--first of all, the House has moved forward a jobs package that has some good elements in it. My understanding is, is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as we speak on the Senate side about some elements of a package.I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on. Just to give you an example, the idea of eliminating capital gains for small businesses--something we can all agree on. I talked about it at the State of the Union Address. My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community banks who are lending to small businesses more capital, because that is something that I keep on hearing is one of the biggest problems that small businesses have out there.So I think that it's realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I think need to be done, and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill can work together, and then we move on to the next aspect of the package, and so forth. It may take a series of incremental steps, but the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is, is that we've got an economy that's growing right now, a huge boost in productivity. That's the good news. The bad news is, is that companies still haven't taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full time. We're seeing an increase in temporary workers, but they haven't yet taken on that full-time worker. And so providing some additional impetus to them right as the economy is moving in a positive direction, I think, can end up yielding some good results.All right? Thank you, guys.

If you can provide me with the contact information for that family you mentioned, I'd like to personally reassure them that my administration stands firmly behind them. We've made significant strides, from ending the transgender military ban to championing the Respect for Marriage Act, but the fight is far from over. There are, unfortunately, elements within our society driven by prejudice and fear-mongering, and it's creating a toxic environment. It's simply unacceptable that someone can be married in the morning and fired in the afternoon for being gay. The rising violence and hate crimes are appalling, and these hateful bills targeting transgender children are nothing short of cruel. These are our children, our neighbors, and we must protect them. That's why we're launching new initiatives to bolster the safety and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community, from increased security at Pride events to addressing civil rights violations and expanding mental health resources. Congress must also act by passing the Equality Act. To all LGBTQ+ Americans, especially our children, know that you are loved, you are heard, and this administration will not waver in its support.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. That was very specific. That's a lot, though. Do you think you can get that done by August? [SEP] Well, I—you know, August is a date that I was musing about, and that date came to mind because I understand how difficult it can be coming down the stretch in the legislative session in a calendar year, because the appropriations bill—you're learning more about this than you probably want to know—but the appropriations bills begin to crowd out the calendar in the latter part of the year. And they can consume a lot of time.And therefore, my hope is—it's certainly not a promise, but my hope would be— that we'd be able to get something out of the Senate and then into the House, and something—then they can work the conference in the fall. That would be the hope.And—but I'm not the person that sets the calendar. I'm just a simple member of the executive branch. [] It's the legislative branch that decides the calendar.And—go ahead. I would like to say that, in fact, the Guatemalan people would have preferred a more clear and positive response, no more deportations, so to say.

But historically, I think that we have never been so close to finding a solution to this problem as now.I was very pleased to hear President Bush say that this is a problem that they also have.

What in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024? [SEP] Nothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is.Do you know anybody who wants us to get rid of the change we made on prescription drug prices and raise prices again? Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and the internet and so on? I don't know any—I think that the problem is, the major pieces of legislation we passed—and some of it bipartisan—takes time to be recognized.For example, you've got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in—up in Scranton, Pennsylvania—the Congressman who got elected. And he said, Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York—New York City? I said: Yes, we can. We can.First of all, it will make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there—we voted for—than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with.And it's the same way—for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year.So there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving.So I'm not going to change—as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I wanted to change and add to. For example, we've—had passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation—you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And—but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil—so I'm not going to change the direction.I said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm—and I know—I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay?One is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are starting—the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more—more—how can I say it?—decent.Second thing I said was, I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hard-working folks.And the third thing—I know is still very hard—I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. As you've pushed for an agreement to reduce nuclear stockpiles between Russia and the U.S., part of your rationale has been that you want to have the moral authority to then turn to North Korea and Iran to get them to suspend their programs. Why will they listen to what the U.S. and Russia have to say? What would it matter to them what we do? [SEP] Well, I don't think it matters so much necessarily that they will listen to the United States or Russia individually. But it gives us the capacity, as the two nuclear superpowers, to make appeals to the broader world community in a consistent way about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the need to reduce that danger and hopefully at some point in time eliminate it.So there are countries that have decided not to pursue nuclear weapons. Brazil, South Africa, Libya have all made a decision not to pursue nuclear weapons. Now, part of the concept behind the Non-Proliferation Treaty was countries could develop peaceful nuclear energy; they would not pursue nuclear weapons if they were signatories to the treaty, and in turn, the United States and Russia would also significantly reduce their nuclear stockpiles.And so part of the goal here is to show that the U.S. and Russia are going to be fulfilling their commitments so that other countries feel that this is an international effort and it's not something simply being imposed by the United States or Russia or members of the nuclear club. And I am confident that we can rebuild a nonproliferation framework that works for all countries. And I think it's important for us to establish a set of international norms that can be verified, that can be enforced.

I'll keep showing them why this is the right move, not just for big business, but for small and medium businesses too. Most importantly, it's for the American worker. I wouldn't back any deal that doesn't create jobs and give Americans a shot at success, higher incomes, and higher wages. That's my top priority. Now, about Elizabeth, it's nothing personal. The press loves to stir things up when allies disagree on policy. But I've got friends in the Senate and House, early supporters even, who don't see eye-to-eye with me on this. And I get it. They've seen plants close, jobs go overseas, just like me. They worry about enforcing labor and environmental agreements. They want fair trade, not just free trade. They're concerned about inequality, automation, and globalization, which have helped those at the top while middle-class families struggle. These are people who share my values. They even put out a progressive statement of principles that was basically my agenda, except for trade. It's a policy difference, a disagreement on what's best for our people. I believe we're better off writing strong rules with teeth on things like child labor, deforestation, and intellectual property. We need to write those rules for the biggest, fastest-growing market in the world. If we don't, China will, and our businesses and workers will suffer. As for outsourcing fears, companies looking for cheap labor can already do it. This deal gives us a chance to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. Nike's bringing back jobs because of new technologies. But we need to be able to sell over there to make the most of it. That's why I'm arguing with my progressive friends. We need to focus on things we agree on: minimum wage, job training, infrastructure, collective bargaining, overtime pay, paid sick leave, and honest budgets. These are the things that will address their concerns. Blocking this trade deal won't, especially since they admit the current rules are bad for U.S. workers. How does sticking with the status quo help? It doesn't make sense. I support enforcement and the signed provisions. I have concerns about the currency language, but I need to talk to Senator Schumer and Sherrod Brown about how to fix it without hurting our monetary policy.

After your discussions today with President Macron, what is your thinking about a timeline for bringing U.S. troops out of Syria?And on one other topic, you mentioned today that you thought the leader of North Korea has behaved openly and honorably. This is someone who many people have accused of starving his people, killing family members. What did you mean when you called him that?

I started a process, and when I did, everybody thought I was doing it absolutely wrong. But in the meantime, for 25 years, people have been dealing, and nothing happened. And a lot is happening right now. I can tell you that, Jeff. A lot is happening. And I think it's going to be very positive. And I hope it's going to be very positive for and for South Korea and Japan and the rest of the world.But I am starting at a level that, frankly, I shouldn't have had to start. This should have been worked out a long time ago. This should have been worked out many years ago. We were discussing that. We shouldn't be having this situation happen to the United States and the world. This should have been resolved by other Presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago.With that being said, I think we're doing very well. Meetings are being set up. And I want to see denuclearization of . A lot of concessions have already been made. We have made no concessions, despite some of the media saying that I've made concessions. I don't—I haven't even discussed a concession other than the fact that meeting is a great thing. And I'm sure that a lot of other people would have liked to have had the position we're having.I will say this: We put the strongest sanctions on a country that we ever have put on any country, by far. China, President Xi, has been very strong in helping us to solve this problem, in his case, at the border. He's allowing very little to get through.I think he's doing that for a number of reasons. We have a very good relationship, and also, it's very important in terms of trade, because I do play the trade card. If you look at what's happening with trade in China, it hasn't been fair for many, many years to the United States, and we're going to solve that problem. In fact, we're having Secretary Mnuchin and a couple of other folks heading over to—Bob Lighthizer—heading over to China, at the request of China. They came here, as you know, last week. And we're having very substantive discussions on trade.But I think it all plays to the border and the fact that they have been extremely strong on the border and very little has gotten through, much to the surprise of a lot of people. And I believe the trade will work out, but I also think that China has never treated us with more respect than they have over the last short period of time that I'm President. I have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with President Xi. And I think that relationship is very important as to what's happening with .So the end result is, we'll see. Maybe good things will happen, and maybe we're all wasting a lot of time. But hopefully, it will be good for everybody concerned.As far as Syria is concerned, I would love to get out. I'd love to bring our incredible warriors back home. They've done a great job. We've essentially just absolutely obliterated ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.

To a large extent, we really have controlled it, and we've set control on it. So we'll see what happens.But we're going to be coming home relatively soon. We finished, at least, almost our work with respect to ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, and we have done a job that nobody has been able to do.But with that being said, I do want to come home. But I want to come home also with having accomplished what we have to accomplish. So we are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal. When they made the Iran deal, what they should have done is included Syria. When I say should have—before giving them, Iran, $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash—$1.8 million in cash. If you think about this, before giving this kind of tremendous money, okay—$150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash—in barrels, I hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out—cash—they should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East where Iraq is involved—where Iran is involved. They didn't do that.So we want to come home. We'll be coming home.

{"sentence": "President Park, regarding North Korea's nuclear program, what is the most crucial element in persuading them to dismantle their weapons, and what did you and President Obama discuss on this topic? Furthermore, what role do you envision for China and Russia in this endeavor? President Obama, what are your impressions of Kim Jong Un, and what message would you convey to him today? [SEP] The shared objective is clear: North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons and become a responsible member of the international community. This is essential for peace on the Korean Peninsula and the world, and it also benefits North Korea's own development. To encourage this change, we must work together. China's influence is significant, so their participation is crucial. China and Russia, along with the international community, share the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are cooperating to guide North Korea. China has actively participated in adopting and implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea's missile fire and nuclear testing. Russia is also firmly committed to denuclearization and has actively supported U.N. Security Council resolutions. They've also worked hard to include a stern message to North Korea in the G-8 Foreign Ministers meeting's joint statement. These efforts are vital to sending a unified message that their nuclear weapons are unacceptable and urging North Korea to make the right decision. I don't know Kim Jong Un personally, so I can't comment on his personal characteristics. However, his actions have been provocative and seem to lead to a dead end. We will maintain a strong deterrent capability and won't reward provocative behavior. But we remain open to North Korea taking a peaceful path of denuclearization, abiding by international commitments, rejoining the international community, and achieving security and prosperity for its people. If North Korea's current path hasn't led to a strong, prosperous nation, now is the time for Kim Jong Un to re-evaluate and change course. If he chooses a different path, the international community would welcome it. China, Russia, Japan, and other key players in the six-party talks have made this clear. But there must be changes in behavior. Actions speak louder than words, and so far, we haven't seen actions indicating a willingness to move in a different direction.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. My question is addressed to President George Bush. Bearing in mind the regional context governed by Presidents such as Vazquez or Chavez, especially, what similarities and what differences do you find amongst them?

We talk about the need to invest and to grow economies through investment. That's a common ground that leads to a positive relationship.We both recognize that education is vital for the success of our respective countries. When we find illiteracy in the United States, that's where we find poverty, oftentimes. And therefore, education policy is focused at improving the lives of all by giving people the skills necessary to compete in the 21st century.I think many people in my country don't know that Uruguay is the leading exporter of software in South America. It means that one of the great assets of this country is the brainpower of the country. Oftentimes when you think of a country like Uruguay, you think of natural resources—fantastic farms, a lot of cows and lambs and blueberries—which, by the way, came up today in our conversation.

{"sentence": "Q. Well, we try to be precise. [Laughter] So on Libya, when you say that you will be transferring command, when are you thinking of transferring command? And would NATO be the preferred partner to take over that command? And the second part of the question is that you have said that you want an alliance among equals with the peoples of the Americas. What deliverables are you going to go for after this trip to achieve it?And----[The reporter asked a question in Spanish, which was translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. ----President Pinera, what is the content of this partnership so as to meet the goals of the region? [SEP] Well, with respect to Libya, obviously the situation is evolving on the ground. And how quickly this transfer takes place will be determined by the recommendations of our commanding officers that the mission has been completed--the first phase of the mission has been completed.As I said, our initial focus is taking out Libyan air defenses so that a no-fly zone can operate effectively and aircraft and pilots of the coalition are not threatened when they're maintaining the no-fly zone. The second aspect of this is making sure that the humanitarian aspects of the mission can be met.But let me emphasize that we anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days and not a matter of weeks. And so I would expect that over the next several days, we'll have more information, and the Pentagon will be fully briefing the American people as well as the press on that issue.NATO will be involved in a coordinating function because of the extraordinary capacity of that alliance. But I will leave it to Admiral Mullen and those who are directly involved in the operation to describe to you how exactly that transfer might be--might take place.With respect to this new partnership, I don't want to give you all my best lines from my speech; otherwise, no one will come. [] But the thing that I'm most excited about is the fact that in a country like Chile, it's not just a matter of what we can give to Chile, it's also a matter of what Chile can offer us.Chile has done some very interesting work around clean energy, so we set up a clean energy partnership. We think we're doing terrific work on alternative energy sources, but there may be initiatives that are taking place here in Chile that might be transferrable to the United States.On education, obviously, we have a long history of public education, and our universities, I think, are second to none. But we want to make sure that in this increasingly integrated world, American students aren't just looking inwards, we're also looking outwards. And so the idea of us setting up a broad-based exchange program with the Americas, I think, makes an enormous difference.Security cooperation: The plague of narcotraffickers in the region is something that we're all too familiar with. And obviously, we have the example of Colombia that has made great strides in bringing security to a country that had been ravaged by drug wars. What lessons can we take and then apply them to smaller countries in Central America, for example, that are going through some of these same struggles?For Chile, the United States, Colombia, other countries to work in concert to help to train effective security operations in Central America to deal with narcotraffickers is a kind of collaboration that would not be as effective if the United States were operating on its own.So I think across the spectrum of issues that we care about deeply and that Chile care about deeply, what will characterize this new partnership is the fact that it's a two-way street. This is not just a situation where a highly developed country is helping a poor and impoverished country; this is a situation where an up-and-coming regional power that has a strong voice in international affairs is now collaborating with us to, hopefully, help greater peace and prosperity for the region and the world. . No doubt that insofar as integration of the Americas, we are lagging behind. And the best way to illustrate this is to compare what has happened in America with what happened in Europe.Last century, the Europeans had two World Wars that--with a toll of more than 70 million casualties. But at some point, they had the wisdom, the courage to abandon the rationale of Line Maginot or Siegfried Line and to embrace Maastricht Treaty. With the leadership and the vision of such renowned statesmen like Adenauer, De Gasperi, Haussmann, Schuman, they began to build what today we know of as European Union.And in America, we are much behind that. In America, 20 years ago, President Bush, father, raised the idea of a free trade area from Alaska to Fire Land [Tierra del Fuego]*, generating a lot of enthusiasm in the region, but it never came true, never materialized.And so the time is right now because Latin America has been for too long the continent of hope or of the future, but a continent cannot be a promise forever. And so we are of age now, and we need to fulfill our mission. Therefore, the main task of Latin America is to recover the lost time and tap all of its potential.We have lots of things in common with the U.S.: vast, generous territory, homogenous peoples, hard-working people. We don't have racial problems that affect some African countries or the wars that raged in Europe, nor the religious conflicts of Europe itself. And therefore Latin America is called to compromise, or rather commitment with its own fate.And therefore, we are looking forward to 's words. We are all left-handed--we have many coincidences--we studied in Harvard, both of us. We are sportsmen. continues to be a basketball player; I was in my time as well. I think the First Lady of the U.S. is very good-looking, and has said the same about the First Lady of Chile. There are plenty of coincidences, but the most important one is the one we'll find this afternoon.And modestly, if I could suggest to , we hope to have a partnership that is 2.0, a one where we have all responsibilities and not an existential alliance, because existentialism has never been enough to face the major problems, but rather, a partnership of collaboration between Latin America and the United States sharing values, principles, and a common vision.And that alliance should be comprehensive. It should reach out to the fields of democracy, freedom, rule of law, defense of human rights. And I think that we have to improve the democratic charter of OAS. It should also open up the doors to the free trade of goods and services, and faster than what we have done hitherto. And in addition to that, to include those subjects which are the true pillars of the 21st century: quality of education, science, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship. Therein lie the pillars for Latin America so as to leave poverty and antidevelopment behind.And we have so much to learn from a country like the United States that, in its 230 years of independent life, has really gave--has given true evidence of being an innovative country and that has made the largest contribution to progress of mankind.And thus, Latin America and the United States have a lot to gain from this alliance, but also has to reach out to two of the most important challenges of the 21st century: energy, to have clean, safe renewable energies; and water--if global warming keeps on going, could be the most scarce resource of our century. And also face the major problems of modern society that cannot be faced unilaterally: organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, global warming, the subject of world security. It can no longer be faced individually. We need to work jointly together.And in our view, that will call for a new international order that will replace that which emerged in Bretton Woods after the Second World War and to be appropriate and adaptive to the needs and challenges of the 21st century, where the only constant thing we have is change.So the time is right to recover all that lost time. And the time is here so that finally, this relationship of encounters, disencounters--of shaking hands or our backs--for that to be in the past. And let us initiate a new era of collaboration, reencountering frankly, effectively, concretely, that will truly face and solve the major problems; that will also open up the doors to tap the main opportunities. This society of knowledge and information is knocking on our doors.Latin America was late to the Industrial Revolution. We cannot be late in this tremendous revolution, which is so much deeper, which is that of knowledge and information. And it has been very generous with the countries that want to embrace it, but very cool with those countries that do not tap it.No child should be left behind; I've heard this from .

On LGBT rights, we've seen a lot of achievements over the past 8 years, including signing hate crimes protection legislation, don't ask, don't tell repeal, marriage equality nationwide, and ensuring transgender people feel visible and accepted. How do you think LGBT rights will rank in terms of your accomplishments and your legacy? And how confident are you that progress will endure or continue under the President-elect? [SEP] I could not be prouder of the transformation that's taken place in our society just in the last decade. And I've said before, I think we made some useful contributions to it, but the primary heroes in this stage of our growth as a democracy and a society are all the individual activists and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, This is who I am, and I'm proud of it.And that opened people's minds and opened their hearts. And eventually, laws caught up. But I don't think any of that would have happened without the activism, in some cases, loud and noisy, but in some cases, just quiet and very personal.And I think that what we did as an administration was to help to—the society to move in a better direction, but to do so in a way that didn't create an enormous backlash and was systematic and respectful of the fact that, in some cases, these issues were controversial. I think that the way we handled, for example, don't ask, don't tell—being methodical about it, working with the Joint Chiefs, making sure that we showed this would not have an impact on the effectiveness of the greatest military on Earth—and then to have Defense Secretary in Bob Gates and Chairman in Mike Mullen and a Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately worked with me to do the right thing, I am proud of that. But again, none of that would have happened without this incredible transformation that was happening in society out there.You know, when I gave Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant what I said. I think somebody that kind and likeable projecting into living rooms around the country, that changed attitudes. And that wasn't easy to do for her. And that's just one small example of what was happening in countless communities all across the country.So I'm proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance.I don't think it is something that will be reversible because American society has changed; the attitudes of young people, in particular, have changed. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be some fights that are important—legal issues, issues surrounding transgender persons—there are still going to be some battles that need to take place.But if you talk to young people of Malia, Sasha's generation, even if they're Republicans, even if they're conservative, many of them would tell you, I don't understand how you would discriminate against somebody because of sexual orientation.

A lasting cease-fire means Hamas stops firing rockets into Israel. There won't be a sustainable cease-fire if they keep firing rockets. I believe the choice is Hamas's to make. The best way to ensure a lasting cease-fire is to work with Egypt to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza that allows Hamas to continue firing rockets. Countries supplying weapons to Hamas need to stop. The international community needs to pressure them to stop providing weapons. Hamas, if they want a lasting cease-fire, needs to stop arming. Countries near Gaza need to stop the smuggling. It's difficult, with tunnels and opportunities for people who want to disrupt democracy to provide weapons.

We're in the process of working on a strategic framework agreement with the i Government that will talk about cooperation on a variety of fronts: diplomacy, economics, justice. Part of that agreement is a security agreement, and I believe that, you know, they want to have an aspirational goal as to how quickly the transition to what we have called overwatch takes place. Overwatch will mean that the U.S. will be in a training mission, logistical support as well as special ops.In order for our troops to be in a foreign country, there must be an understanding with the Government. There must be authorities to operate as well as protections for our troops. We're in the process of negotiating that as well.

He expressed a willingness to offer assistance on Afghanistan – I won't elaborate on the specifics at this juncture – as well as on Iran and other matters of mutual interest.

{"sentence": "Q. But will they be part of the mission? [SEP] Absolutely. We are in consultations as we speak. As I said, there are different phases to the campaign. The initial campaign, we took a larger role because we've got some unique capabilities. Our ability to take out, for example, Qadhafi's air defense systems are much more significant than some of our other partners. What that does then is it creates the space, it shapes the environment in which a no-fly zone can actually be effective.It was also important to make sure that we got in there quickly so that whatever advances were being made on Benghazi could be halted and we could send a clear message to Qadhafi that he needed to start pulling his troops back.Now, keep in mind, we've only been in this process for 2 days now, and so we are continuing to evaluate the situation on the ground. I know the Pentagon and our Defense Department will be briefing you extensively as this proceeds. But the core principle that has to be upheld here is that when the entire international community almost unanimously says that there's a potential humanitarian crisis about to take place, that a leader who has lost his legitimacy decides to turn his military on his own people, that we can't simply stand by with empty words, that we have to take some sort of action.I think it's also important to note that the way that the U.S. took leadership and managed this process ensures international legitimacy and ensures that our partners, members of the international coalition are bearing the burden of following through on the mission as well. Because, as you know, there--in the past, there have been times where the United States acted unilaterally or did not have full international support, and as a consequence, typically it was the United States military that ended up bearing the entire burden.Now, last point I'll make on this: I could not be prouder of the manner in which the U.S. military has performed over the last several days. And it's a testament to the men and women in uniform, who, when they're given a mission, they execute and do an outstanding job.But obviously, our military is already very stretched and carries large burdens all around the world. And whenever possible, for us to be able to get international cooperation--not just in terms of words, but also in terms of planes and pilots and resources--that's something that we should actively seek and embrace, because it relieves the burden on our military and it relieves the burden on U.S. taxpayers to fulfill what is an international mission and not simply a U.S. mission.", "label": "Explicit"}

Of course, any service in Afghanistan carries risks, but casualties have dropped significantly since we shifted away from combat. The Afghan security forces are stepping up, fighting bravely, and improving. While some rotations may be extended, we've gone from 100,000 troops to under 10,000, and they're not on the front lines.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, John Howard put climate change at the center of this APEC meeting. Haven't you undermined his attempt to establish aspirational goals here by scheduling your own meeting in Washington? And to what extent do you regard ratification of Kyoto as being relevant to addressing climate change? [SEP] Let me start with the latter. Since I'm getting older, you may have to repeat the first part of the question. Kyoto may work for other countries. It may have made sense for certain countries that ratified it; it just didn't make sense for the United States. And so therefore, I told the truth. And by the way, prior to my arrival in Washington, the United States Senate was given a chance to express their approval or disapproval of whether or not Kyoto made sense to the United States. There was a 95-to-nothing vote against Kyoto. So it's just not my opinion; there's a lot of people who thought Kyoto wasn't the way to go.So we developed a different approach: energy efficiency standards based upon new technologies. And as I told you, we reduced greenhouse gases in America last year, and our economy grew at 3 percent. I don't know if many countries can make that claim, but we can because our strategy in— of putting new technologies in place is working.I happen to believe that we can do a better job of becoming less dependent on foreign oil. As an energy exporter, that might kind of frighten some of the energy exporters. But we've got to reduce our dependency on oil, and therefore, have put forth what's called a 20-in-10 program. Over the next 10 years, we will reduce our gasoline consumption by 20 percent by using ethanol and other new technologies. I believe battery technology is going to be coming on so that people in Sydney can drive the first 40 miles in their cars on battery without your car looking like a golf cart.In other words, there's new technologies coming to market. And the fundamental question is, how to get them to market as quickly as possible? And Kyoto didn't do that as far as we were concerned. As a matter of fact, it's a—if you begin to take an assessment or inventory of countries that are actually meeting the Kyoto targets, I think you'll find that maybe a different approach makes sense. So the reason we rejected Kyoto is because it wouldn't have allowed us to do what we wanted to do, which is grow our economy, become less dependent on foreign oil, and be good stewards of the environment.John and I have talked about his desire to put climate change at the forefront of APEC, and I was a strong supporter of that. I also reminded him that at the G- 8, I took the message that said to our partners there that if you really want to really solve the global climate change issue, let's get everybody to the table. Let's make sure that countries such as China and India are at the table as we discuss the way forward. Otherwise, I suspect, if they feel like nations are going to cram down—a solution down their throat and not give them a voice on how to achieve a common objective, they'll walk. And then you can't have effective global climate change if a nation like China is not involved.I thought the Prime Minister did something smart in this protocol. He announced that we need to cut back on tariffs that prohibit the exportation of technologies that will enable China, for example, to burn coal in a cleaner way. In other words, they've protected their environmental industries. And he wants to tear down those tariffs and barriers, and we support him strongly on this, so that technology is more likely to be able to flow from those of us who have it to those who don't.And there are fundamental questions: How fast can we get effective technology to the market—coal sequestration technologies, nuclear spent fuel reprocessing technologies to the market? And once to the market, can we help developing nations acquire those technologies? Otherwise, it's an exercise that's not going to be effective.And I believe the strategy that we have laid forth is the most effective way to deal with this issue in a serious way. I also appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister is the one that brought the issue to focus and, two, is talking about energy dependency, energy efficiency standards, which is a part of the global climate mix. He shows that leadership on the issue, and I'm proud to be here talking about the issue. Okay. Thank you.", "label": "Explicit"}

Their impressive growth has lifted millions out of poverty, benefiting the world and America by allowing China to be a responsible partner and a large market for us, Korea, and other nations.

The RMB issue is a point of contention, not just for the US, but for many of China's trading partners who compete globally. It's undervalued, and China intervenes significantly to maintain that.

The key is to mix things up: fix the system, spend wisely, and get the economy growing. When the economy's booming, you've got more money to pay off debt. Cutting spending when things are bad just makes it worse. Now, we've got the advantage of the dollar being the top dog. People trust us. But the main thing is, we learned from our mistakes.

That means we need to save more, cut debt, and be more competitive. We need the best education, more engineers, and a better infrastructure. But it also means a level playing field.

It's a massive investment in climate change, the largest in history, so there will inevitably be glitches. For example, the provision about free trade agreements was intended to apply to allies, not literally every country with a free trade agreement. We can work these things out. The core principle is ensuring the United States, and hopefully Europe, doesn't have to rely on anyone else's supply chain. We want to be our own supply chain and share that with our allies. There are tweaks we can make to make it easier for European countries to participate or be self-sufficient. It was never my intention to exclude our allies.

{"sentence": "Having now surpassed George W. Bush in time served as President during wartime, and potentially concluding your presidency with troops still deployed in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, how do you reconcile this reality with the promises made during your campaign? Furthermore, should the American populace resign itself to a state of perpetual conflict, even if it deviates from the conventional warfare of the 20th century? [SEP] That is indeed a multifaceted question. Firstly, regarding the State Department, I acknowledge the concerns. The exponential growth in information presents a significant challenge. The proliferation of email, text messaging, and smartphones has generated an unprecedented volume of data. While these technologies offer undeniable convenience, enabling real-time access to information previously unavailable to my predecessors, they simultaneously overwhelm the Department's capacity to effectively sort, classify, and secure this information against cyber threats. Overly restrictive classification practices, however, negate the benefits of this enhanced information flow. Secretary Kerry is actively pursuing various initiatives to address these challenges. This issue reflects a broader governmental trend. The volume of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and the corresponding volume of responsive information, has increased dramatically. This presents significant challenges across all government agencies, particularly in the realm of national security. We are actively working to mitigate these challenges. Turning to the issue of war, when I assumed office, approximately 180,000 troops were deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. That number has since been significantly reduced. Our troops are no longer engaged in active combat operations, but rather in training and advisory roles, with the exception of targeted strikes against ISIS in collaboration with Iraqi and Syrian partners. The nature of our military operations has evolved. However, your point regarding non-state actors operating within fragile states is well-taken. Our objective is to partner with these countries to enhance border security and eliminate terrorist threats. This process, as exemplified by Afghanistan, requires sustained commitment. While Afghan forces have become increasingly capable, they continue to require our support. We face a choice between withdrawing, potentially leading to state collapse and subsequent re-intervention, or maintaining a limited partnership to bolster their capacity. The absence of a clear-cut surrender scenario with non-state actors necessitates a hybrid approach, encompassing partnerships, state-building, conflict resolution, local collaboration, and targeted strikes. While interstate warfare has declined, this persistent, low-intensity threat poses a real danger and fuels societal anxieties. We must refine our approach. The release of data on civilian casualties resulting from drone strikes reflects our commitment to accountability. While imperfect, we are striving for continuous improvement. From the NSA to drone operations to Guantanamo, I am confident that my efforts will result in a more legally sound and ethically grounded framework. However, further work remains.

{"sentence": "Q. So you're not negotiating and they say you have to negotiate, and you're not considering another plan B, then do you just wait it out, and we do go—we do see all these things happen? [SEP] Well look, Chuck, there arethere's a pretty straightforward way of doing this, and that is to set the debt ceiling aside, we pay our bills, and then we have a vigorous debate about how we're going to do further deficit reduction in a balanced way.Now, keep in mind that what we've heard from some Republicans in both the House and the Senate is that they will only increase the debt ceiling by the amount of spending cuts that they're able to push through andin order to replace the automatic spending cuts of the sequesterthat's $1.2 trillion. Say it takes another trillion or trillion-two to get us through one more year, they'd have to identify $2.5 trillion in cuts just to get the debt ceiling extended to next year2.5 trillion.They can't evenCongress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they're happy with. Because these same Republicans say they don't want to cut defense; they've claimed that they don't want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable. But the truth of the matter is, is that you can't meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare or having an impact on Medicaid or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesn't add up.Now, whathere's what would work. What would work would be for us to say we've already done close to $2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if you add the interest that we won't be paying because of less spending and increased revenue, it adds up to about $2.5 trillion. The consensus is we need about $4 trillion to stabilize our debt and our deficit, which means we need about $1.5 trillion more. The package that I offered to Speaker Boehner before webefore the new year would achieve that. We were actually fairly close in terms of arriving at that number.So if the goal is to make sure that we are being responsible about our debt and our deficit, if that's the conversation we're having, I'm happy to have that conversation. And by closing some additional loopholes through tax reformwhich, Speaker Boehner has acknowledged, can raise money in a sensible wayand by doing some additional cuts, including making sure that we are reducing our health care spending, which is the main driver of our deficits, we can arrive at a package that gets this thing done.I'm happy to have that conversation. What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people: the threat that unless we get our way, unless you gut Medicare or Medicaid or otherwise slash things that the American people don't believe should be slashed, that we're going to threaten to wreck the entire economy.

I'm confident it can be done.My budget, frankly, does it. I understand that—I don't expect the Republicans simply to adopt my budget. That's not realistic. So I recognize that we're going to have to compromise. And as I said on election night, compromise is hard and not everybody gets 100 percent of what they want and not everybody is going to be perfectly happy.But what I will not do is to have a process that is vague, that says we're going to sort of, kind of, raise revenue through dynamic scoring or closing loopholes that have not been identified. And the reason I won't do that is because I don't want to find ourselves in a position 6 months from now or a year from now where, lo and behold, the only way to close the deficit is to sock it to middle class families or to burden families that have disabled kids or have a parent in a nursing home, or suddenly, we've got to cut more out of our basic research budget that is the key to growing the economy in the long term.So that's my concern. I'm less concerned about red lines per se. What I'm concerned about is not finding ourselves in a situation where the wealthy aren't paying more or aren't paying as much as they should, middle class families one way or another are making up the difference. That's the kind of status quo that has been going on here too long, and that's exactly what I argued against during this campaign. And if there's one thing that I'm pretty confident about is the American people understood what they were getting when they gave me this incredible privilege of being in office for another 4 years.They want compromise. They want action. But they also want to make sure that middle class folks aren't bearing the entire burden and sacrifice when it comes to some of these big challenges.

{"sentence": "Q. You and Prime Minister Gillard have outlined what is for us a significant new U.S. troop buildup. How much of this is because you're worried about the rise of China? And as of today's deal, U.S. Marines will be for the first time conducting exercises by themselves on Australian soil. Why is that, and what will they be doing?And, Mr. President, you also mentioned in your remarks that Afghanistan is not an easy mission. In the past few months, there have been three cases for Australia where our troops have been shot at by the Afghan soldiers who have been training, and sadly, four of our soldiers have died, and many others have been injured. Australian public opinion is strongly against our involvement continuing. You outlined the--just then, the drawdown. What can you say to the Australian people who don't want to wait, who want to leave immediately? [SEP] Well, first, with respect to these new initiatives, this rotational deployment is significant because what it allows us to do is to not only build capacity and cooperation between our two countries, but it also allows us to meet the demands of a lot of partners in the region that want to feel that they're getting the training, they're getting the exercises, and that we have the presence that's necessary to maintain the security architecture in the region.And so, as Julia mentioned, this is a region that's becoming increasingly important. The economy in this area is going to be the engine for world economic growth for some time to come. The lines of commerce and trade are constantly expanding. And it's appropriate then for us to make sure that not only our alliance, but the security architecture of the region is updated for the 21st century, and this initiative is going to allow us to do that.It also allows us to respond to a whole host of challenges, like humanitarian or disaster relief, that frankly, given how large the Asia-Pacific region is, it can sometimes be difficult to do, and this will allow us to be able to respond in a more timely fashion and also equip a lot of countries, smaller countries who may not have the same capacity, it allows us to equip them so that they can respond more quickly as well.And I guess the last part of your question, with respect to China, I've said repeatedly and I will say again today that we welcome a rising, peaceful China. What they've been able to achieve in terms of lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last two decades has been nothing short of remarkable. And that is good not just for China, but it's potentially good for the region. And I know Australia's economy obviously has benefited by the increased demand that you're seeing in China.The main message that I've said not only publicly, but also privately to the Chinese is that with their rise comes increased responsibilities. It's important for them to play by the rules of the road and in fact help underwrite the rules that have allowed so much remarkable economic progress to be made over the last several decades. And that's going to be true on a whole host of issues.So where China is playing by those rules, recognizing its new role, I think this is a win-win situation. There are going to be times where they're not, and we will send a clear message to them that we think that they need to be on track in terms of accepting the rules and responsibilities that come with being a world power.With respect to Afghanistan, the impact of any loss of life among our troops is heartbreaking. And obviously, as President of the United States, there's no greater responsibility and nothing more difficult than putting our troops in harm's way. I think Prime Minister Gillard feels the same way that I do, which is we would not be sending our young men and women into harm's way unless we thought it was absolutely necessary for the security of our country.What we have established is a transition process that allows Afghans to build up their capacity and take on a greater security role over the next 2 years. But it's important that we do it right. As some of you are aware, I just announced that all remaining troops in Iraq will be removed. It would have been tempting, given that I have been opposed to the Iraq war from the start, when I came into office, to say, we're going to get you all out right away. But what I recognized was that if we weren't thoughtful about how we proceed, then the enormous sacrifices that had been made by our men and women in the previous years might be for naught.And what I'd say to the Australian people at this point is, given the enormous investment that's been made and the signs that we can, in fact, leave behind a country that's not perfect, but one that is more stable, more secure, and does not provide safe haven for terrorists, it's appropriate for us to finish the job and do it right. If I could just add to that and say, every time I have met President Obama and we've talked about our alliance, we've talked about our work in Afghanistan, and in our meetings, both formal and informal, the President has shown the greatest possible concern for our troops in the field. Now, the meetings we've had over the last few weeks at various international events have coincided with some of the most bitter and difficult news that we've had from Afghanistan, and every step of the way the President has gone out of his way to convey to me his condolences for the Australian people and particularly for the families that have suffered such a grievous loss.

I think that it's a--as Chip alluded to, the politics that swept him into the Speakership were good for a midterm election; they're tough for governing.

[SEP] Good Well, first of all, we're still getting the details of what happened And I expect to be in communications, potentially directly, with President Erdogan sometime over the next several daysTurkey, like every country, has a right to defend its territory and its airspace I think it's very important right now for us to make sure that both the Russians and the Turks are talking to each other to find out exactly what happened and take measures to discourage any kind of escalationI do think that this points to a ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to a Turkish border and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey, but a wide range of countries And if Russia is directing its energies towards Daesh and ISIL, some of those conflicts, or potentials for mistakes or escalation, are less likely to occurI also think this underscores the importance of us making sure that we move this political track forward as quickly as possible Like President Hollande, our view from the start has been that Russia is welcome to be part of this broad-based coalition that we've set up There's never been a point in time in which we said that we don't want Russia or other countries that may have differences with us on a whole host of other things to avoid working with us against ISILThe challenge has been Russia's focus on propping up Asad rather than focusing on ISIL I had a conversation with President Putin in Turkey, and I indicated to him at the time that to the extent that they make that strategic shift—focus on the Vienna process, where they have been constructive, to try to bring all the parties together; try to execute a political transition that all parties would agree to; and refocus attention on going after ISIL—then there's enormous capacity for us to cooperateUntil that happens, it's very difficult It's difficult because if their priority is attacking the moderate opposition that might be future members of an inclusive Syrian Government, Russia is not going to get the support of us or a range of other members of the coalitionBut I do think that there is the possibility of cooperation The sooner we agree to this political process, the less likely that you have the kinds of events that took place, apparently, today President Hollande The event that took place is a serious one, and we can only regret it Turkey is currently providing all of the information to NATO so that we can find out what truly happened and whether Turkey's airspace indeed was entered into But we must prevent an escalation; that would be extremely damageable The only purpose is to fight against terrorism and Daesh This is what we must do, all of us: we, Turkey, RussiaAnd what just took place, like Barack said, means that we must find a solution to the Syrian crisis, because we can see what the risks are otherwise: the risks of escalation I, therefore, will be traveling to Russia this week because we have this resolution of the Security Council, and it does show that we must take action against Daesh, against terrorism That resolution has been voted unanimously In a way, that was the broadest possible coalitionThen, I will ask President Putin, as I've done before and what I told the Russians a number of times already, that the strikes must be against Daesh, against terrorism, and those who precisely are threatening us They are threatening the Russians, like ourselves in Europe, like France that was targeted over the past few days We must, therefore, coordinate ourselves, cooperate, but on that basis, and make sure that we're all acting against Daesh And that will be part of the political process, one that must lead to the solution And we all know what the parameters of the solution are or are not We know that there's a deadlock todayLastly, I mentioned the aircraft carrier, which is in the east of the Mediterranean now As a matter of fact, there are also some Russian forces And I, therefore, agreed with President Putin that we must share our intelligence so that we can act in coordination We must not contradict ourselves And it's already the case, and we'll continue to do so[]", "label": "General"}

[SEP] It is the global expectation that Iran and Syria will contribute constructively to the stabilization of Iraq, a point we have articulated with utmost clarity. Regarding Iran, our concerns are multifaceted and profound. The primary question is whether they will facilitate the success of Iraq's nascent democratic institutions. Secondly, their support for the Lebanese democracy, specifically the Siniora Government, is of paramount importance to this administration. However, the most pressing issue remains Iran's potential acquisition of nuclear weapons. Our position is unequivocal: a path of cooperation, not isolation, is in the best interests of both the Iranian government and its people. We will continue to emphasize that their support for terrorism and pursuit of nuclear weapons will only lead to further isolation from the international community. Our diplomatic efforts are ongoing, and the Iranian government is fully cognizant of our position on Iraq, as is the Iraqi government itself. We are committed to supporting the sovereignty and stability of Iraq, and the Iraqi government has conveyed to Iran the imperative of non-interference in their internal affairs.

And to this end, as you know, I've committed 3,200—3,500 additional marines to send a clear signal that we're willing to do our part.I was very pleased to listen to the comments of President Sarkozy, where he indicated his willingness to increase troop presence. Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of— in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people—nations in our alliance—to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this—of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq. So the question nations have to ask: Is it worth it? And my answer is, absolutely, it's worth it—and so is the President—it's worth it for our own security, and it's worth it for the cause of peace. Thank you. Regarding Afghanistan, we have a main idea that any lack of success of the NATO in Afghanistan will diminish dramatically the credibility of our organization. And for the time being, the civilized world don't have alternatives to the security than NATO. We have to do everything what we can in order to make a success in our action in Afghanistan: granting democratic development of the country, economic development of the country, security of the country, and eliminating the terrorist risks which are generated by this region. Sure, we have a extremely clear idea if we don't keep the terrorists in Afghanistan. If we will let them free, they'll come in Europe, they'll come in United States. For this reason, we have to win; we have to obtain the victory in Afghanistan.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Your successor spoke by phone with the President of Taiwan the other day and declared subsequently that he wasn't sure why the United States needed to be bound by the one-China policy. He suggested it could be used as a bargaining chip perhaps to get better terms on a trade deal or more cooperation on North Korea. There's already evidence that tensions between the two sides have increased a bit, and just today, the Chinese have evidently seized an underwater drone in the South China Sea. Do you agree, as some do, that our China policy could use a fresh set of eyes? And what's the big deal about having a short phone call with the President of Taiwan? Or do you worry that these types of unorthodox approaches are setting us on a collision course with perhaps our biggest geopolitical adversary? [SEP] Well, that's a great question. I'm somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I think one of the—I've said this before—I am very proud of the work I've done. I think I'm a better President now than when I started. But if you're here for 8 years in the bubble, you start seeing things a certain way, and you benefit from—the democracy benefits, America benefits from some new perspectives.And I think it should be not just the prerogative, but the obligation of a new President, to examine everything that's been done and see what makes sense and what doesn't. That's what I did when I came in, and I'm assuming any new President is going to undertake those same exercises.And given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake in terms of the world economy, national security, our presence in the Asia-Pacific, China's increasing role in international affairs—there's probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and where there's also the potential if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full-conflict mode, that everybody is worse off. So I think it's fine for him to take a look at it.What I've advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you're doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. And since there's only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on what's gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what we've learned from 8 years of experience, so that as he's then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he's got all the information to make good decisions and, by the way, that all of Government is moving at the same time and singing from the same hymnal.And with respect to China—and let's just take the example of Taiwan—there has been a longstanding agreement, essentially, between China, the United States, and to some degree, the Taiwanese, which is to not change the status quo. Taiwan operates differently than mainline—mainland China does. China views Taiwan as part of China, but recognizes that it has to approach Taiwan as an entity that has its own ways of doing things. The Taiwanese have agreed that as long as they're able to continue to function with some degree of autonomy, that they won't charge forward and declare independence.And that status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful and—economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination. But understand, for China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation.And so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what are the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they'll treat some other issues. They won't even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we've had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves. And their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant.That doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past. It does mean that you've got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in.All right. Isaac Dovere of Politico.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Following your talks with President Putin, what is your assessment of his willingness to foster a more open media environment in Russia, especially considering the recent expulsion of several independent news organizations?

I'd put it in terms of how much interest he has in burnishing Russia's reputation, ensuring it's not seen as contrary to democratic principles and free speech. That's a judgment I can't make. I don't know. It's not because I think he's interested in changing the nature of a closed society or government's actions relative to what he thinks is the right of government to do what it does; it's a very different approach. There are some really good biographies – I told him I read a couple – I read most everything he's written and the speeches he's made. And I've read a couple of very good biographies, which many of you have as well. I pointed out to him that Russia had an opportunity – that brief shining moment after Gorbachev – to generate a democratic government. But it failed, and there was a great race among intellectuals to determine what form of government they would choose. Based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided that Russia has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a Russian state, not based on ideology – whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution, the Russian Revolution, and to where they are today. I think it's clear to me that he decided that the way for Russia to sustain itself as a great power is to unite the Russian people on just the strength of the government – the government controls – not necessarily ideologically, but the government. I think that's the choice that was made. I'm not going to second guess whether it could have been fundamentally different.

Your critics will say on Capitol Hill that you want gas prices to go higher because you have said before, that will wean the American people off fossil fuels, onto renewable fuels. How do you respond to that? [SEP] Ed, just from a political perspective, do you think the President of the United States going into reelection wants gas prices to go up higher? [] Is that--is there anybody here who thinks that makes a lot of sense?Look, here's the bottom line with respect to gas prices. I want gas prices lower because they hurt families. Because I meet folks every day who have to drive a long way to get to work, and them filling up this gas tank gets more and more painful, and it's a tax out of their pocketbooks, out of their paychecks, and a lot of folks are already operating on the margins right now.And it's not good for the overall economy, because when gas prices go up, consumer spending oftentimes pulls back. And we're in the midst right now of a recovery that is starting to build up steam, and we don't want to reverse it.What I have also said about gas prices is that there is no silver bullet and the only way we're going to solve this problem over the medium and long term is with an all-of-the-above strategy that says we're going to increase production, which has happened; we are going to make sure that we are conserving energy--that's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, which will save consumers about $1.7 trillion and take about 12 billion barrels of oil offline, which will help to reduce prices; and we're going develop clean energy technologies that allow us to continue to use less oil.And we've made progress. I mean, the good news is, 2010, first time in a decade that our oil imports were actually below 50 percent, and they have kept on going down. And we're going to keep on looking at every strategy we can to, yes, reduce the amount of oil that we use, while maintaining our living standards and maintaining our productivity and maintaining our economic growth, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that consumers aren't hurt by it.Now, there are some short-term steps that we're looking at with respect to--for example, there are certain potential bottlenecks in refineries around the country that we've been concerned about. We're concerned about what's happening in terms of production around the world. It's not just what's happening in the Gulf. You've had, for example, in Sudan, some oil that's been taken offline that's helping to restrict supply.So we're going to look at a whole range of measures, including, by the way, making sure that my Attorney General is paying attention to potential speculation in the oil markets. We--I've asked him to reconstitute a Task Force that's examining that.But we go through this every year. We've gone through this for 30 years. And if we are going to be competitive, successful, and make sure families are protected over the long term, then we've got to make sure that we've got a set of options that reduce our overall dependence on oil.And with respect to Israel, I am not the first President who has been unable, because of a whole range of issues, not to visit Israel as President in their first term. I visited Israel twice as Senator, once right before I became President. The measure of my commitment to Israel is not measured by a single visit. The measure of my commitment to Israel is seen in the actions that I've taken as President of the United States.

But what I can do—maybe this is a fair response to your question—is to say how I've tried to lead the country on this issue.More than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race; to encourage people to listen to each other; to recognize that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn't suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama; that things have gotten better—substantially better—but that we've still got a lot more work to do; and that, as was the case with the police Task Force that we set up, that I've tried to encourage people to come up with practical, concrete solutions that can reduce, if not eliminate, the problems of racial bias.And if my voice has been true and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away, but it surfaces problems, it frames them; it allows us to wrestle with these issues and try to come up with practical solutions; and that that perspective may lead to continued improvement so that not just Malia and Sasha, but their children can experience a country that is more just and more united and more equal.And that's not going to happen right away, and that's okay.

We did it in Saudi Arabia, a direct hit. Japan will be acquiring a significant amount of equipment from us, the best in the world, creating jobs here and ensuring Japan's security. My relationship with President Xi is excellent. I consider him a friend, but he represents China, and I represent the United States. Our views differ, but we're aligned on trade. China's been taking advantage of us for years, resulting in a massive trade deficit. We're addressing it. It's about reciprocal trade. If they charge us a tariff, we'll charge them the same. Some countries charge us exorbitant taxes, while we charge them nothing. That's ending. We're taking action, but it takes time due to legal requirements. The legal groundwork is laid. You'll see strong action against those who treat us unfairly. I view companies as extensions of the American worker. As for Japan's defense, we purchase much from the U.S. The North Korean situation is serious, so we're enhancing our defense capabilities.

President Barroso, are EU food safety rules too strict, given the disputes with the U.S.? [SEP] Okay, John, interesting idea by the—His Majesty, the King of Saudi Arabia. Secondly, I articulated a policy that I had been articulating ever since I have been the President. It's the same policy, which is, we believe in a strong dollar and that relative value of economies will end up setting the proper valuation of the dollar. Past growth, or growth with little comparison in the his-tory—this is the growth of energy and food prices. And the food prices are going up due to high cost of energy or oil, and this has a significant effect on the economy in Slovenia and throughout Europe. This is one of the key questions being dealt with at the national level and at the level of the European institutions, as has been mentioned by President Barroso. This is a serious problem. It will, on the one hand, make us search long-term solutions. I have mentioned this in part before. And on the other hand, it will make us search short-term solutions, and one of these is energy efficiency.We have also discussed this at today's summit, and this is a strong message. The investment in research and development, the investment into what the economy can do, an economy that is less dependent on carbon, less dependent on fossil fuels, this will have a long-term strategic effect on the price.So the key is the technology. I remember the President of the United States saying 2 years ago at the summit meeting in Vienna that the key thing is investment in the development of new technologies. This is the key strategic reply to these challenge. And as far as the euro is concerned, on the one hand, we are satisfied and happy that euro is a strong currency. And since the 1st of January of last year, Slovenia is also part of the euro zone. And I can say that in the majority, the effects are positive.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, sir, finding votes for the debt ceiling can sometimes be complicated. You, yourself, as a Member of the Senate, voted against a debt ceiling increase. And in previous aspects of American history—President Reagan in 1985, President George Herbert Walker Bush in 1990, President Clinton in 1997—all signed deficit reduction deals that were contingent upon or in the context of raising the debt ceiling. You, yourself, four times have done that. Three times, those were related to deficit reduction or budget maneuvers.What Chuck and I and, I think, many people are curious about is this new, adamant desire on your part not to negotiate, when that seems to conflict with the entire history in the modern era of American Presidents and the debt ceiling and your own history on the debt ceiling. And doesn't that suggest that we are going to go into a default situation, because no one is talking to each other about how to resolve this? [SEP] Well, no, Major, I think if you look at the history, getting votes for the debt ceiling is always difficult, and budgets in this town are always difficult. I went through this just last year. But what's different is we never saw a situation as we saw last year in which certain groups in Congress took such an absolutist position that we came within a few days of defaulting. And the fact of the matter is, is that we have never seen the debt ceiling used in this fashion, where the notion was, you know what, we might default unless we get 100 percent of what we want. That hasn't happened.Now, as I indicated before, I'm happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits further in a sensible way. Although, one thing I want to point out is that the American people are also concerned about how we grow our economy, how we put people back to work, how we make sure that we finance our workers getting properly trained and our schools are giving our kids the education we deserve. There's a whole growth agenda which will reduce our deficits that's important as well.But what you've never seen is the notion that has been presented, so far at least, by the Republicans that deficit reductionwe'll only count spending cuts; that we will raise the deficitor the debt ceiling dollar for dollar on spending cuts. There are a whole set of rules that have been established that are impossible to meet without doing severe damage to the economy.And so what we're not going to do is put ourselves in a position where in order to pay for spending that we've already incurred, that our two options are we're either going to profoundly hurt the economy and hurt middle class families and hurt seniors and hurt kids who are trying to go to college, or alternatively, we're going to blow up the economy.

{"sentence": "Q. With the increased slowdown in the drawdown here, we're looking at more risk, more danger for U.S. troops that are in Afghanistan. How do you justify that to them? How do you tell them that the mission is still worth it? And how do you assure them that there is an end coming to this mission?And for President Ghani, you've talked the last couple days a lot about the sacrifice of U.S. troops. You were at Arlington earlier today. How do you tell them that this continued sacrifice will be worth it to them as well? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think it's important, Leo, to remember the timeline for a withdrawal down to a Embassy-centered presence, a normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016. So that hasn't changed. Our transition out of a combat role has not changed.Now, I am the first to say that as long as our men and women in uniform are serving in Afghanistan, there are risks involved. It's a dangerous place. Casualties have come down precipitously as we've engaged in the drawdown. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed in Afghanistan. That has occurred precisely because we're not in a combat role. And I think it is worth noting the significant casualties that the Afghan security services have incurred. As we've drawn down, they've stood up, and they're fighting. And they're fighting with courage and tenacity, and they're getting better month by month. But you can't minimize the sacrifices that our military families make. It means some folks are going to be rotating back into Afghanistan for a few extra months relative to what otherwise would have been the case. We're essentially moving the drawdown pace over to the right for several months, in part to compensate for the lengthy period it took for Government formation; in part because we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to help Afghan security forces succeed so we don't have to go back, so we don't have to respond in an emergency because counterterrorist—or because terrorist activities are being launched out of Afghanistan.We're on the path to do that, and it was my assessment as Commander in Chief that it made sense for us to provide a few extra months for us to be able to help on things like logistics, making sure that equipment is not just in place, but it's also used properly; that the training and advising and strategic input that's been provided continues through this fighting season, in part so that President Karzai [Ghani]*, who has taken on the mantle of Commander in Chief in a way that we have not seen in the past from an Afghan President, can do a serious review and can assess here is where our strengths are, here's where our weaknesses are, and we can proceed with more effective joint planning going forward.So the bottom line is our men and women in uniform make enormous sacrifices. Their families do too; they serve alongside them. This will mean that there are going to be some of our folks who are in Afghanistan under the new schedule who would have been home. But it is important to keep in perspective, first of all, that we've gone down from 100,000 down to under 10,000; that they are not on the front lines because they're not in a combat role. We are doing all that we can do to make sure that force protection is a priority for those who are in Afghanistan. And the date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change.But it is my judgment, it's the judgment of General Campbell and others who are on the ground, that providing this additional timeframe during this fighting season for us to be able to help the Afghan security forces succeed is well worth it. And in that sense, once again, we are asking our men and women in uniform to fight on behalf of our freedom and on behalf of a more orderly world.It does, perhaps, raise one thought, which is, right now there's a debate going up on Capitol Hill about budgets. This would be a good time for my friends up on Capitol Hill, including on the other side of the aisle, to take a look at their budgets. If we're holding both our defense and nondefense budgets to 2006 levels, it's a lot harder for us to do the job that we need to do not only on the national security side, but also here at home, making sure that when our men and women come home, and when they potentially go into civilian life, that they've got a strong economy, that their kids have good schools, that they can send their kids to college, that they get the veterans benefits that they have so richly earned and deserve. That would be a good way for us to express the thanks for the sacrifices they consistently make. I met yesterday the widow of General Greene. She would like the memory of her husband to be preserved by a sustainable Afghanistan that is secure. The 2,215 Americans that have died must not die in vain. They must leave behind a legacy of a stable Afghanistan. And it's that preservation of those gains that I think inspires the American service men and women to obey the call of their commander, the order of their commanders.Second, we have taken them out of the harm's way. As the President mentioned, for the past 100 days, because the combat role has ended, the exposure, the number of casualties is really down. There isn't—my most horrible reading of the day is my first, middle-of-the-day, and end-of-the-day security reports where I see the casualties of the Afghan figures. But thank God they're no longer American or European casualties.John Campbell is making sure that they remain in support role. Their train, advise, assist role has risks, but they're nowhere comparable to combat role. And end of that combat role is very significant to this. And again, the institutional gains that would be achieved through the train, advise, and assist role is what will guarantee that the investments of the last 14 years pay off in terms of gains that would ensure.Last point: Afghanistan is the front line. Because of American engagement in Afghanistan, there have not been attacks on mainland United States. But let's not forget that fortresses cannot be built around countries or continents.

People are already facing enough uncertainty with these rising gas prices, potentially hitting four dollars a gallon. The prospect of their taxes increasing on top of that? That's a double whammy. Beyond that, we need a comprehensive energy strategy. Renewables are great, but we also need to be realistic. We need to be exploring for more oil and gas right here at home. That's a temporary solution, I know, but it's crucial while we're transitioning to new technologies. We haven't built a new refinery in ages! I even suggested using old military bases, but Congress didn't go for it. Simple supply and demand: less supply, prices go up. And this talk about taxing oil companies?

How is that dynamic changing, your level of frustration with the lack of political progress? And how long can Americans reasonably expect you to wait before you take some kind of action that really forces the Iraqi Government's hand to reach the goals of reconciliation that you set for them? [SEP] In my speech, I made it clear that there has to be a change in security for there to be reconciliation. And I also said that progress will yield fewer troops. In other words, return on success is what I said.There are two types of reconciliation, David. One is that reconciliation, that very visible reconciliation that happens through the passage of law. In other words, it's reconciliation that shows the i people that people from different backgrounds can get along and, at the same time, that Government can function. Clearly, there needs to be work there. In other words, there needs to be the passage of law. For example, we strongly believe that an oil revenue sharing law will send a message to Sunni, Shi'a, and Kurd alike that there is an effort at the national level to achieve reconciliation.Having said that, however, there is a functioning government. And the reason I bring—I guess my point is this, that in spite of the fact they haven't passed a law, there is the sharing of oil revenues on a relatively equitable basis. The other—and so we'll continue to work with the Government to insist and impress upon them the need for there to be the passage of law, whether it be Provincial election laws or de-Ba'athification law or the oil law.There is local reconciliation taking place. I had a fascinating conversation in the Roosevelt Room earlier this week with members of Provincial Reconstruction Teams from around , who talked about how people are sick and tired of murder and violence and that they expect their local governments and their central Government to be more responsive to their needs. And local governments are beginning to respond.Part of the reason why there is not this kind of instant democracy in is because people are still recovering from Sad-dam Hussein's brutal rule. I thought an interesting comment was made when somebody said to me—I heard somebody say, where's Mandela? Well, Mandela is dead because Saddam Hussein killed all the Mandelas. He was a brutal tyrant that divided people up and split families, and people are recovering from this. So there's a psychological recovery that is taking place. And it's hard work for them. And I understand it's hard work for them. Having said that, I'm not going to give them a pass when it comes to the central Government's reconciliation efforts.I also said in my speech, local politics will drive national politics.

Mr. President, under what—you've said repeatedly that you are willing to walk away from the negotiations if they don't do well. Under what exact conditions would you be walking away from that summit? And if the summit does go well, will you be inviting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the United States? [SEP] Well, the answer is yes to the second part of your question. But certainly, if it goes well. And I think it would be well received. I think he would look at it very favorably. So I think that could happen.All I can say is, I am totally prepared to walk away. I did it once before. You have to be able to walk away. If you're not going to be able to walk away—we didn't walk away from the horrible Iran deal that was signed. And if you look at what's happened since I signed that deal, Iran—and in all fairness, I say it with great respect for the people of Iran—but Iran is acting a lot differently. They're no longer looking so much to the Mediterranean. They're no longer looking so much to what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Yemen and lots of other places. They're a much different country over the last 3 months.And again, I say that with hope that maybe something can happen. But when you mention sanctions, we're putting sanctions on Iran, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, including, frankly, . That would have been the next phase, if we did it or find it necessary to do.But nuclear to me is always first. And we're going to be fine, with respect to Iran. But we also, Saagar, got something out of it that's very important. A lot of the people that write about this, some of whom I have great respect for, but they haven't picked it up: Iran is not the same country that it was a few months ago. They're a much, much different group of leaders. And I hope at some point they'll come to us and we'll sit down and we'll make a deal that's good for them and good for us and good for everybody. And it will be great for Iran. I expect it to be—I want it to be—great for Iran.But if they would have walked—our side—from some of the horrible provisions that you know as well as I do, and probably everybody sitting here knows, we could have had a great deal. Nothing wrong with a deal, but there's something wrong with that deal. We had a great opportunity to make a phenomenal deal.So I am totally prepared to walk. It could happen. Maybe it won't be necessary. I hope it won't be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong Un wants to do something that is going to be great for his people and also great for his family and great for himself.Okay?

So, last night, I informed the Republicans – who have been working tirelessly on this package and are committed to doing what's right for the country – that while I believe a payroll tax cut would be beneficial, it's unlikely to gain Democratic support. As you know, we need their votes to pass this legislation. While we hold a majority, it's not sufficient to overcome their opposition. That's why we have an election coming up. So, we need to secure Democratic votes, and it's clear that we won't get them on this issue. I believe it would be a significant boost for the American worker.

The global economy is also strong, which benefits our exports and growth. The liquidity in the system is a key factor, and I'm told it's sufficient for market corrections.

Let's talk about what actually happened. Muammar Qadhafi, responsible for more American deaths than almost anyone before Usama bin Laden, was threatening to massacre his people. As part of an international coalition, under a nearly unprecedented U.N. mandate, we took out air defense systems so the coalition could enforce a no-fly zone and protect the people on the ground. I told the American people we wouldn't put troops on the ground and wouldn't carry the lion's share of the operation. We've done exactly what I said we would. Our allies have carried a big load, and we've protected thousands in Libya. No U.S. casualties, no risk of escalation. This operation is limited in time and scope. We've consulted with Congress throughout. So, a lot of this fuss is politics. We've done exactly what we said we'd do, under a U.N. mandate, and protected thousands of lives. Qadhafi is pinned down. The War Powers Resolution came up after Vietnam, when we had half a million soldiers there and lost tens of thousands of lives. Congress wanted to prevent that from happening again.

And unemployment insurance remains vital given the current job market. Supporting families while they seek employment is crucial for the broader economy. Now, we could achieve significant discretionary cuts, paired with targeted reductions in non-healthcare mandatory spending, like ethanol programs. This could create space for a tax cut benefiting ordinary families. However, I must emphasize, this is not my preferred approach. Think of it as a tiered solution. We can address the immediate needs, but to truly resolve the issue for the long term, we need bolder decisions and compromise. If we're serious, we can stabilize the situation for a decade or more, fostering a more favorable business environment and restoring public confidence in Washington.", "label": "General"}

I called lears of both Chambers, both parties yesterday to thank them for the initial statements coming out of the meeting that they had with Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke. I found a common unrstanding of how severe the problem is and how it is necessary to get something done quickly, and I think we will.And we'll continue to work with them. It is essential that the package be robust and strong to address the problem. I know—look, I'm sure there are some of my friends out there saying, I thought this guy was a market guy; what happened to him?Well, my first instinct wasn't to lay out a huge Government plan. My first instinct was to let the market work, until I realized that—upon being briefed by the experts, of how significant this problem became.And so I cid to act and act boldly. It turns out that there's a lot of interlinks throughout the financial system. The system had grown to a point where a lot of people were pennt upon each other, and that the collapse of one part of the system wouldn't just affect a part of the financial markets, it would affect the average citizen. And how? Well, it'd affect their capacity to borrow money to buy a house or to finance a college loan. It'd affect the ability of a small business to get credit. In other words, the systemic risk was significant, and it required a significant response, and Congress unrstands that. And we'll work to get something done as quickly and as big as possible.There's going to be billions—hundreds of billion dollars at risk. This is a big package, because it was a big problem. And, you know, I tell our—I will tell our citizens and continue to remind them that the risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package and that, over time, we're going to get a lot of the money back.

What can do the United States to help us in rescue the hostages who keep in captivity—— Presint Bush. What did we do to help? Presint Uribe. Yes, actually you are doing very much to help us in—against illicit drugs. And the first question he ma was about how we can unblock the free— the approval of the free tra agreement. Presint Bush. Yes. Thank you. First of all, it is—a government has to be effective and efficient in orr for any help to work. In other words, we could—our intentions could be great to help al with FARC or extremists. But unless there's a well-organized government head by termined learship, that help doesn't work.And so the progress that's been ma is a tribute to the Colombian Government and Presint Uribe. The United States is a partner. But the truth of the matter is, the credit goes to the Uribe Government.And we will continue to stand with a Government that's willing to do hard things. And there's nothing harr than to al with FARC. But it's unniable that progress is being ma and that the FARC is weaker, FARC is on the run. People are leaving FARC because of the generous hand that the Government has reached out with.I unrstand how important the free tra agreement is to Colombia. It's not only economically important, because, as the Presint said, if the—there's doubt about the free tra agreement, investment will become nervous. And without investment, it's very hard for the Colombian economy to continue to sustain growth, and without economic growth, it's hard to be in a hopeful society.Secondly, the free tra agreement is more than just an economic agreement, it is a statement of friendship, it's a statement of common values. And if this agreement were not to pass, it would emboln the voices of populism in the neighborhood, to the triment of a Government which has been very strong in aling with human rights and human dignity and the market.And so I appreciate the Presint being here if this statement will help clarify the issue once again.

And I sat down at a table—a roundtable with the six other world leaders from the European Union, the United—and Canada, et cetera, and said, America is back. And one of them turned to me and said: For how long? For how long? It was a deadly earnest question: For how long?And I looked at them. And then another one went on to say—and I'm not going to name them—went on to say, What would you say, Joe, if in fact you went—we went to bed tonight here in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the Parliament of Great Britain—gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the confirmation of an election? It's not the same situation, obviously, as we have. And he said, What would you think?And what—I ask the rhetorical question: What would you all think? You'd think England was really in trouble. You'd think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain. And so that's the way people were looking at us, like, When is this going to stop? Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don't want to exaggerate. But literally, nothing like this has happened since the Civil War.And so what I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we're about? Are we the same democracy we've always been? Because, look, the rest of the world looks to us—I don't mean that we're always—like we're always right. But if the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change.And so they're very concerned that we are still the open democracy we've been and that we have rules and the institutions matter. And that's the context in which I think that they're looking at: Are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the Court, by the Congress, by the Government, et cetera?", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

The G-7 is united in the belief that we have to stay at this until the whole world is covered, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own self-interest.

[SEP] We are taking President Karzai's accusations very seriously and will be working with Afghan intelligence to investigate them fully. There is no question that extremists are operating out of Pakistan and crossing into Afghanistan, which is a concern for all of us. We all face a common enemy in those who use violence to disrupt or prevent democracy. Al-Qaeda is still present, although we have weakened them significantly. We have applied pressure on them globally, including in Pakistan, and will continue to do so with the help of our Pakistani allies. I am confident that the Pakistani government understands the dangers posed by these extremists. I will have the opportunity to discuss this further with the Pakistani Prime Minister next week. Pakistan is an ally and a friend. The United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan all share a common enemy. I vividly remember a meeting at the White House with Presidents Musharraf and Karzai where we discussed the need for cross-border cooperation to prevent dangerous elements from training and entering Afghanistan, and then returning home with skills that could be used against the government. We made some hopeful progress, but it remains a tough fight. We were encouraged by the Provincial elections in that region.

The message to Iran must be: stop sending sophisticated equipment that is killing our people. We are negotiating a long-term security agreement with Iraq precisely to create space for their democracy to develop. My message to Ahmadi-nejad is: stop exporting terror.

So why can't we counter those messages and, obviously, not withdraw precipitously, but begin some sort of gradual withdrawal that prevents ethnic cleansing, but also allows our military to get out? [SEP] Well, there's a lot of discussion about a scenario in which our troop posture would be to guard the territorial integrity of the country of Iraq, to embed and train, to help the Iraqi security forces deal with violent elements in their society, as well as keep enough Special Forces there to chase down Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, that is something that I've spoken in public about, said that's a position I'd like to see us in. However, I felt like we needed to send more troops to be able to get the situation to quiet down enough to be able to end in that position.And in terms of my own decisionmaking, as I mentioned earlier, I definitely need to be in consultation, and will be, with General David Petraeus, who asked for the additional troops in the first place, troops which have been in place—fully in place for about 3 weeks.And so I would ask Members of Congress to give the general a chance to come back and to give us a full assessment of whether this is succeeding or not.

Let me jump in on the Prime Minister's answer for a sec. He'll be blasting those missiles out of the sky once he finishes buying all that sweet military gear from us. Like we did in Saudi Arabia, boom, missile gone. That was like hitting a needle in the sky, no damage.

[] Chuck, we're going to assign you to the Supreme Court, man. []I'm not a Supreme Court Justice, so I'm not going to put my constitutional law professor hat on here. Let me focus on, initially, the issue of . I want to talk about the substance of because there's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened.Muammar Qadhafi, who, prior to Usama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect--provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interests and also because it's the right thing to do.We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies--who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations--have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in ; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the Members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics.And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down, and the noose is tightening around him.Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers Resolution, it came up after the Vietnam war in which we had half a million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent, and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments, you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

Thirdly, we are heartened by the fact that the Kosovo Government has clearly proclaimed its willingness and its desire to support Serbian rights in Kosovo. We also believe it's in Serbia's interests to be aligned with Europe, and the Serbian people can know that they have a friend in America.

Well, and given the fact that you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you thought about just—once you'd made the decision to weigh in, why not just argue that marriage is a right that should be available to all people of this country? [SEP] Well, that's an argument that I've made personally. The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court is obliged to answer the specific question before them. And the specific question presented before the Court right now is whether Prop. 8 and the California law is unconstitutional.And what we've done is we've put forward a basic principle, which is—which applies to all equal protection cases. Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court asks the question, what's the rationale for this—and it better be a good reason. And if you don't have a good reason, we're going to strike it down.And what we've said is, is that same-sex couples are a group, a class, that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the Supreme Court needs to ask the State why it's doing it. And if the State doesn't have a good reason, it should be struck down. That's the core principle, as applied to this case.Now, what the Court—the Court may decide that if it doesn't apply in this case, it probably can't apply in any case. There's no good reason for it. If I were on the Court, that would probably be the view that I'd put forward. But I'm not a judge, I'm the President.

Also, how challenging was it to promote stimulus measures when your own efforts are currently stalled in Congress? [SEP] The discussion about stimulus measures was brief, some time ago. We talked about ways to boost economic growth, which don't always mean government spending. The rebalancing agenda, for example, can significantly increase global demand through adjustments by countries, without traditional fiscal stimulus. There wasn't a dispute with the Europeans. They agree it's important to show that the European project is strong, that they're committed to the euro, and that they're determined to solve the crisis. European leaders know this starts with a unified approach. We've seen all the pieces for dealing with the crisis put in place, which we think are the right ones. First, a solution for Greece, involving debt reduction, reforms, and structural changes, despite recent issues. Second, recapitalizing Europe's banks, which is key for market confidence. Third, creating a firewall to show that Europe is supporting the euro. The details are being worked out. We gave them some ideas.

We could have had this debate without that harm. For instance, the US, despite flaws, upholds the law, privacy, civil liberties, and our Constitution. Because of these leaks, nations that do what Snowden fears—surveillance, targeting dissidents, suppressing the press—criticize the US. That's a skewed view.

The international framework we've established is putting unprecedented pressure on Iran. They've indicated a willingness to return to negotiations, and we need to explore that opportunity while maintaining pressure. I won't disclose the specifics of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, but my public statements reflect our private discussions. Israel is a sovereign nation and must make its own security decisions. Sanctions are having a significant impact on Iran, affecting their oil industry and central bank. They're considering returning to the negotiating table, making it in everyone's interest to pursue a peaceful resolution. The notion that we face an immediate decision is inaccurate. We've made an unprecedented commitment to Israel's security. Friends offer honest advice, and this issue is not just about Israeli interests; it's about U.S. interests as well.

[SEP] I've had their back. I've had their back my entire career. I've never not had their back. And I started on the voting rights issues long, long ago. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place.And I think part of the problem is—look, there's significant disagreement in every community on whether or not the timing of assertions made by people has been in a most timely way. So I'm sure that there are those who are saying that: Why didn't Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard as he pushed it the last month? Why didn't he push it 6 months ago as hard as he did now?The fact is that there is—there's a timing that is not of one's own choice; it's somewhat dictated by events that are happening in country and around the world as to what the focus is.But part of the problem is, as well, I have not been out in the community nearly enough. I've been here an awful lot. I find myself in a situation where I don't get a chance to look people in the eye, because of both COVID and things that are happening in Washington, to be able to go out and do the things that I've always been able to do pretty well: connect with people, let them take a measure of my sincerity, let them take a measure of who I am.For example—I mean, as I pointed out in South Carolina, you know, last time, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I got the Act extended for 25 years, and I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it. That's what I've been doing my whole career. And so the idea that I—that I didn't either anticipate or because I didn't speak to it as fervently as they want me to earlier.In the meantime, I was spending a lot of time—spent hours and hours and hours talking with my colleagues on the Democratic side, trying to get them to agree that if in fact this occurred, if this push continued, that they would be there for John Lewis and—anyway.So—but I think that's—that's a problem that is my own making by not communicating as much as I should have. Yet you find that when you deal with Members of the Black Caucus and others in the United States Congress, I still have very close working relationships.So it's like every community. I'm sure that there are those in the community, in—I'm a big labor guy.

[SEP] Well, certainly there is going to be room for discussion. My hope is, is that on this small-business bill that is before the Senate right now, that we actually make some progress. I still don't understand why we didn't pass that 2 months ago. As I said, this was written by Democrats and Republicans. This is a bill that traditionally you'd probably get 90 percent or 100 percent Republican support. But we've been playing politics for the last several months.

Why would we borrow money on policies that won't help the economy and help people who don't need help?But setting that aside, we've got an area of agreement, which is, let's help families out there who are having a tough time. As I said, we could, this month, give every American certainty and tax relief up to $250,000 a year. Every single American would benefit from that. Now, people who make $250,000 a year or less, they'd benefit on all their income. People who make a million dollars would benefit on a quarter of their income. But the point is, is that that's something that we can all agree to. Why hold it up? Why hold the middle class hostage in order to do something that most economists don't think makes sense?", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Q. That's quite a lead-in, Mr. President, thank you. Rick Ledgett, who is the head of the NSA task force on Edward Snowden, told 60 Minutes that it was, worth having a conversation about granting Edward Snowden amnesty. To what degree, sir, were you pleased that he floated this trial balloon? And under what circumstances, would you consider either a plea agreement or amnesty for Edward Snowden? And what do you say to Americans, sir, who after possibly being alerted to Judge Leon's decision earlier this week, reading the panel recommendations, believe Edward Snowden set in motion something that is proper and just in this country about the scope of surveillance and should not be considered by this Government a criminal? [SEP] I've got to be careful here, Major, because Mr. Snowden is under indictment; he's been charged with crimes. And that's the province of the Attorney General and ultimately a judge and a jury. So I can't weigh in specifically on this case at this point. I'll make—I'll try to see if I can get at the spirit of the question, even if I can't talk about the specifics.I've said before and I believe that this is an important conversation that we needed to have. I've also said before that the way in which these disclosures happened have been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities. And I think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage.I'll give you just one specific example. The fact of the matter is that the United States, for all our warts, is a country that abides by rule of law, that cares deeply about privacy, that cares about civil liberties, that cares about our Constitution. And as a consequence of these disclosures, we've got countries who actually do the things that Mr. Snowden says he's worried about very explicitly—engaging in surveillance of their own citizens, targeting political dissidents, targeting and suppressing the press—who somehow are able to sit on the sidelines and act as if it's the United States that has problems when it comes to surveillance and intelligence operations. And that's a pretty distorted view of what's going on out there.So I think that, as important and as necessary as this debate has been, it is also important to keep in mind that this has done unnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and U.S. diplomacy. But I will leave it up to the courts and the Attorney General to weigh in publicly on the specifics of Mr. Snowden's case.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

While some domestic firms expressed reservations, the decision was made in consideration of national security imperatives.

[SEP] We dedicated considerable time to discussing Uruguay's concerns regarding market access for specific products. The President highlighted issues such as quotas on goods like cows and sheep, which he deemed unfair. I assured him that I would carefully consider his requests. As for blueberries, Uruguay produces exceptional ones, and the core issue is ensuring their access to the U.S. market. I emphasized that problems must be addressed openly, and we will assist where possible, providing explanations when we cannot. I share concerns about protectionism globally, believing that free and fair trade reduces poverty. I am committed to the Doha round of the WTO and have discussed strategies with President Lula. The U.S. is prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, provided there is market access for our products. Our trade minister remains in Sao Paulo to advance this complex but vital deal. In response to the first question, I fully concur with President Bush. We have established a forum for experts and ministers to address bilateral issues. Uruguay advocates for free trade and reduced tariffs and subsidies that hinder our cultural exports. We also explored GSP progress on specific issues.

Al-Qaeda remains a serious threat, and we must maintain good intelligence, effective response mechanisms, and continue to pressure them in theaters of war. We must chase them down and bring them to justice before they can harm us again. This is a long-term ideological conflict that will outlast my presidency.

The independent panel I appointed provided 46 recommendations after a thorough review. I met with them to discuss these recommendations. I want to thank them for their excellent work. They took my charge seriously, which was to evaluate whether our current structures and programs effectively address our need for security while upholding rule of law, privacy, and civil liberties. We are currently evaluating these recommendations. In January, I will provide a definitive statement outlining which recommendations we will implement, which require further refinement, and how they relate to our work both internally and with international partners. This is a debate that needed to be had.

{"sentence": "Q. China Daily. The world is watching very closely today's summit meeting between you, President Xi, and President Obama. And the China-U.S. relationship has gone beyond the bilateral scope. It is increasingly consequential for the whole world and for this region. As China further develops, how does China see its own position and role in international affairs? [SEP] Thank you for your question. There are very wide areas where China and the United States need to and can cooperate with each other. And as the international situation continues to experience complex, fluid, and profound changes, there will be even more areas where our two countries need to work together.In recent years, China and the United States worked together to counter the impact of the global financial crisis. We have also worked together to try and resolve some regional hotspot issues, such as the Korean nuclear issue, the Iranian nuclear issue, the situation in Syria, and so on, through dialogue. We've also partnered with each other to address some serious challenges, including climate change, terrorism, and the Ebola epidemic.The strategic significance of China-U.S. relations is on the rise. China is a participant in, builder of, and contributor to the current international system. China's economic development is in itself an important contribution to the global efforts to address the international financial crisis and to promote the recovery and the growth of the world economy.China has sent more personnel to U.N. peacekeeping missions than any other permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. To date, we have sent over 20,000 of our military personnel to various U.N. peacekeeping operations. And the Chinese navy has conducted 45 escort missions in the piracy-ridden waters of the Gulf of Aden. And China is firm in opposing all forms of terrorism, and we have all along been supportive of international cooperation to fight terrorism.The Chinese people empathize with the Western African countries that are experiencing the Ebola epidemic. We have so far provided four tranches of assistance that is worth 750 million RMB. And even as we speak, there are over 300 Chinese medical personnel working on the ground in Africa to help the affected areas.As China continues to develop, we will shoulder more and more international responsibilities that are commensurate with our own strengths and position. We will remain firmly committed to working with other countries to share China's development opportunity and to address various challenges. And we will make our due share of contribution to maintaining and promoting peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.Both and I believe that when China and the United States work together, we can become an anchor of world stability and a propeller of world peace. China stands ready to work with the United States to firm up our confidence, exercise our wisdom, and take action to strengthen our coordination and cooperation bilaterally, regionally and globally and to effectively manage our differences on sensitive issues so that we can make new gains in building the new model of major-country relations between China and the United States, which serves the fundamental interests of our two peoples and the people elsewhere in the world.China and United States have different historical and cultural traditions, social systems, and phases of development. So it's natural that we don't see eye to eye on every issue. But there have always been more common interests between China and United States than the differences between us. Both sides should respect each other's core interests and the major concerns and manage our differences in a constructive fashion through dialogue and consultation so as to uphold the overall interests of stable growth of China-U.S. relations.And I had a candid discussion with on human rights issues. Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and especially over the last three decades and more of China's reform and opening era, China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world.On the question of human rights, we should never consider our work to be mission accomplished. It's always work in progress, and there is always room for further improvement. China stands ready to have dialogue with the United States on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect so that we can constructively handle our differences, deepen our mutual understanding, and learn from each other.In my talks with , I also pointed out that the Occupy Central is an illegal movement in Hong Kong. We are firmly supportive of the efforts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to handle the situation according to law so as to maintain social stability in Hong Kong and protect the life and the property of the Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong affairs are exclusively China's internal affairs, and the foreign countries should not interfere in those affairs in any form or fashion. And we will protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign citizens and business organizations in Hong Kong as well. And I think it goes without saying that law and order must be maintained according to law in any place, not just in Hong Kong, but also elsewhere in the world.China and the United States are important countries in the world. It's perfectly normal for there to be different views expressed about us in the international media. And I don't think it's worth fussing over these different views. And I don't see any of the regional free trade arrangements as targeting against China. China is committed to open regionalism. And we believe the various regional cooperation initiatives and the mechanisms should have positive interaction with each other, and that is the case at the moment.And China protects our citizens' freedom of expression and the normal rights and the interests of media organizations in accordance with law. On the other hand, media outlets need to obey China's laws and regulations. When a car breaks down on the road, perhaps we need to get off the car to see where the problem lies. And when a certain issue is raised as a problem, there must be a reason. In Chinese, we have a saying: The party which has created a problem should be the one to help resolve it. So perhaps we should look into the problem to see where the cause lies.Thank you.", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Last question, I guess. [Laughter] Mr. President, 6 years ago this month, I asked you what was the state of Black America in the Oval Office, and you said it was the the best of times and the worst of times. You said it was the best of times in the sense that there was—has never been more opportunity for African Americans to receive a good education and the worst of times for unemployment and the lack of opportunity. Well, ending 2014, what is the state of Black America as we talk about those issues as well as race relations in this country? [SEP] Like the rest of America, Black America in the aggregate is better off now than it was when I came into office. The jobs that have been created, the people who've gotten health insurance, the housing equity that's been recovered, the 401 pensions that have been recovered—a lot of those folks are African American. They're better off than they were.The gap between income and wealth of White and Black America persists. And we've got more work to do on that front. I've been consistent in saying that this is a legacy of a troubled racial past of Jim Crow and slavery. That's not an excuse for Black folks. And I think the overwhelming majority of Black people understand it's not an excuse. They're working hard. They're out there hustling and trying to get an education, trying to send their kids to college. But they're starting behind, oftentimes, in the race.And what's true for all Americans is, we should be willing to provide people a hand up, not a handout, but help folks get that good early childhood education, help them graduate from high school, help them afford college. If they do, they're going to be able to succeed, and that's going to be good for all of us. And we've seen some progress. The education reforms that we've initiated are showing measurable results. We have the highest high school graduation that we've seen in a very long time. We have—are seeing record numbers of young people attending college. In many States that have initiated reforms, you're seeing progress in math scores and reading scores for African American and Latino students as well as the broader population. But we've still got more work to go.Now, obviously, how we're thinking about race relations right now has been colored by Ferguson, the Garner case in New York, a growing awareness in the broader population of what I think many communities of color have understood for some time, and that is that there are specific instances, at least, where law enforcement doesn't feel as if it's being applied in a colorblind fashion.The Task Force that I formed is supposed to report back to me in 90 days, not with a bunch of abstract musings about race relations, but some really concrete, practical things that police departments and law enforcement agencies can begin implementing right now to rebuild trust between communities of color and the police department.And my intention is to, as soon as I get those recommendations, to start implementing them. Some of them we'll be able to do through executive action. Some of them will require congressional action. Some of them will require action on the part of States and local jurisdictions.But I actually think it's been a healthy conversation that we've had. These are not new phenomenon. The fact that they're now surfacing, in part because people are able to film what have just been, in the past, stories passed on around a kitchen table, allows people to make their own assessments and evaluations. And you're not going to solve the problem if it's not being talked about.In the meantime, we've been moving forward on criminal justice reform issues more broadly. One of the things I didn't talk about in my opening statement is the fact that last year was the first time in 40 years where we had the Federal prison population go down and the crime rate go down at the same time, which indicates the degree to which it's possible for us to think smarter about who we're incarcerating, how long we're incarcerating, how are we dealing with nonviolent offenders, how are we dealing with drug offenses, diversion programs, drug courts. We can do a better job of—and save money in the process by initiating some of these reforms. And I've been really pleased to see that we've had Republicans and Democrats in Congress who are interested in these issues as well.The one thing I will say—and this is going to be the last thing I say—[]—is that I—one of the great things about this job is you get to know the American people. I mean, you meet folks from every walk of life and every region of the country and every race and every faith. And what I don't think is always captured in our political debates is, the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing, and people are basically good and have good intentions. Sometimes, our institutions and our systems don't work as well as they should. Sometimes, you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn't maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around. But if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems. It's not—this isn't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying. I think that troubles everybody. So there's an opportunity of all of us to come together and to take a practical approach to these problems.And I guess that's my general theme for the end of the year, which is, we've gone through difficult times. It is your job, press corps, to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and the crises that look like they're popping. And I understand that. But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better. The economy has gotten better. Our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better. We know more about how to educate our kids. We solved problems. Ebola is a real crisis; you get a mistake in the first case because it's not something that's been seen before—we fix it. You have some unaccompanied children who spike at a border, and it may not get fixed in the time frame of the news cycle, but it gets fixed.And part of what I hope, as we reflect on the new year, this should generate is some confidence. America knows how to solve problems. And when we work together, we can't be stopped.And now I'm going to go on vacation. everybody. [] . Thank you, everybody.", "label": "Explicit"}

Has Afghanistan now become the primary theater in the war on terror, surpassing Iraq? Are Al Qaeda and the Taliban gaining an advantage?

[SEP] First, let me say that any loss of life, whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere, is a tragedy, and our hearts go out to the families. We are deeply grateful for the willingness of Americans to volunteer and sacrifice in these dangerous times. Second, while June was a difficult month in Afghanistan, it was also a tough month for the Taliban. The increased casualties are partly due to our troops actively engaging a formidable enemy. This enemy opposes our presence because they reject the idea of America denying them safe haven. We are promoting an ideology that clashes with theirs, so resistance is inevitable. I am confident in our strategy, which involves confronting the Taliban and Al Qaeda while simultaneously promoting a free society through sound economic, educational, and healthcare policies. We continuously assess troop needs and levels. We are currently halfway through 2008, and as I've stated, we will increase troop numbers by 2009.

Mr. President, at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversation the two of you had in the Oval Office, about a subject he didn't disclose: If we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there's still a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong. Since the Vice President brought it up, can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulus bill or the bank rescue plan--[laughter]--and if in general, you agree with that ratio of success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success? [SEP] You know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to. [] Not surprisingly. But let me try this out. I think what Joe may have been suggesting, although I wouldn't put numerical--I wouldn't ascribe any numerical percentage to any of this--is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have, any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, not all of the solution. And as I said in my introductory remarks, not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out.This is an unprecedented problem. And when you talk to economists, there is some general sense of how we're going to move forward; there's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude; there's a strong consensus that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment, but that there should be a range of approaches.But even if we do everything right on that, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system, and making sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to have to deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure that we've got a regulatory structure--a regulatory architecture for the financial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. So I don't know whether Joe was referring to that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about these issues.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

[SEP] President Bush: We dedicated considerable time to addressing Uruguay's concerns regarding market access for specific products. The President raised various trade-related issues, expressing his belief that quotas on items such as cows and sheep were unfair. I assured him that I would give his requests due consideration. You may have thought I was joking about blueberries, but I wasn't. It turns out that Uruguay produces exceptional blueberries. The fundamental question is whether Uruguayan blueberry growers will be able to sell their products in the United States. We discussed a range of produce, and I emphasized that problems can only be resolved if they are brought to the table. I pledged to provide assistance where possible and to explain the reasons why if assistance was not feasible. I am concerned about protectionist tendencies, both within our own country and globally. I believe that a world characterized by free and fair trade is more likely to address poverty. Therefore, I strongly support the completion of the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with the President. I spent considerable time with President Lula, who was highly interested in our discussions, and I shared our conversations with him. I did not betray any confidences, of course, but I discussed the need to advance the Doha round. The United States is fully prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, as I explained to the President. We simply want to ensure market access for our products. That is what I told President Lula, the Europeans, and the President. I am optimistic that we can reach an agreement. Our trade minister, Susan Schwab, has remained in Sao Paulo to continue discussions with her Brazilian counterpart, all with the aim of making progress toward a complex but necessary deal. President Vazquez: In response to the first question, I fully agree with President Bush's remarks. We have established a framework, starting with this meeting, where our experts and ministers will discuss and make progress on bilateral relationship issues. Regarding the general multilateral situation, Uruguay has consistently advocated for free trade and the reduction of tariffs and subsidies that impede the sale of our significant cultural products. We have also explored the possibility of advancing the GSP, particularly on certain issues that will be considered in the coming weeks.

To take the second question first, just as a part of a follow-up on Chuck's question, I feel confident about 's security around its nuclear weapons programs. But that doesn't mean that there isn't improvement to make in all of our nuclear security programs. I mean, you'll recall that we had a little incident a while back where we had nuclear-tipped missiles on a bomber flying across the United States, and nobody knew about it. And Secretary Gates took exactly the right step, which was to hold those in charge accountable and to significantly alter our practices to make sure something like that didn't happen again.So I think it's important to note that every nuclear power, every country that has a civilian nuclear energy program has to take better steps to secure these materials. And is not exempt from that, but we aren't either. And that's, I think, the goal of this summit, and that was the goal of the communique and the work plan that we've put forward.With respect to sanctions, I think that we have a strong number of countries on the Security Council who believe this is the right thing to do. But I think these negotiations can be difficult. And I am going to push as hard as I can to make sure that we get strong sanctions that have consequences for Iran as it's making calculations about its nuclear program and that those are done on a timely basis.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding the energy legislation, while you champion it as a step towards curbing greenhouse emissions, critics point to the administration's resistance to California's stricter emission standards. How do you reconcile these seemingly contradictory positions? Furthermore, could you elaborate on the specific aspects of your discussion with Vice President Gore concerning climate change strategies? [SEP] Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. As for the first part of your question, the key is to have a strategy that actually works. Is it more effective for each state to have its own rules on greenhouse gas emissions, or should we have a national plan? Director Johnson made a decision based on the legislation we passed, which gives us a national strategy. We're increasing CAFE standards to 35 miles per hour by 2020 and substantially increasing alternative fuels to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The Director assessed the law and decided we now have a national plan. That's one of the benefits of Congress passing this legislation.I told Vice President Gore that I take the issue seriously, and we're developing a strategy that will deal with it effectively. Yesterday's bill is part of that strategy. Replacing as much gasoline as we're suggesting will do a lot to improve greenhouse gases. By the way, the bill I signed was a little weaker than the one I wanted, but I was still happy to sign it.One of the key components to being successful with reformulated fuel standards is to spend research and development money on cellulosic ethanol, new ways to manufacture ethanol. We can't rely only on corn to meet these standards. I understand that a lot of people in the farm belt are getting concerned, unless, of course, you're a corn grower. But if you're feeding cattle or hogs, the cost of business has gone up. That's one of the trade-offs you have to make. So I want to assure people out there that we're spending a lot of taxpayer money to figure out how to use wood chips or switchgrass to make ethanol. This is a real national plan.Secondly, to be effective on a global basis, countries that emit greenhouse gases need to be at the table. One of the main reasons I was against Kyoto was that China wasn't at the table. We could do all we wanted to do, but it wouldn't affect greenhouse gases over the long run unless a country like China agreed to participate in a strategy.So we went to the Bali Conference with that in mind and worked out a compromise that said we're committed to a process that will unfold over the next two years. But we've also got a parallel process working to make sure major emitters sit at the table and come together, hopefully, on a goal that we all agree to. It's a strategy that I laid out at the G-8 in Germany, explained to everyone in Bali, and we think will be effective.I absolutely take the issue seriously. But I want to make sure that we're effective in what we do and, secondly, don't wreck our economy. It's hard to develop the technologies necessary to maintain our standard of living and deal with greenhouse gases if you're broke. If you don't have any money, it's really hard to develop new technologies. So we need to be prosperous for a lot of reasons, primarily so our citizens can have a good life, but also so that we're wealthy enough to make the investments necessary to deal with greenhouse gases.Finally, if you're truly serious about dealing with greenhouse gases, then it seems like you ought to be a strong supporter of nuclear power. Nuclear power enables us to generate electricity without emitting one unit of greenhouse gases. I'm amazed that our country isn't more robust in supporting the advent of nuclear power. I certainly am and applaud those efforts by Members of Congress to provide incentives for the construction of new plants.If you're someone who says greenhouse gases are of vital national interest, then you ought to be saying, 'I'm for the development of nuclear power plants.' It's by far the best solution to making sure we have economic growth and, at the same time, be good stewards of the environment.When you couple increasing CAFE standards with using alternative fuels—which deals with the automobile area—as well as a good strategy on electricity, then all of a sudden, you begin to see a strategy unfold. By the way, the final thing is that we do have 250 years of coal. I believe we can develop technologies that will enable us to use that coal in an environmentally friendly way.What I'm suggesting is that we do have a strategy. Our strategy is to bring others to the table. Our strategy is to develop our own plan to meet the national goals—the international goals that I hope we'll be able to set later on this summer.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Today's fix that you just announced leaves it up to State insurance commissioners and insurance companies to ultimately decide whether to allow old policies to be renewed for a year. How confident are you that they will do that? And secondly, how concerned are you that this flawed rollout may hurt Democrats' chances in next year's midterm elections and your ability to advance other priorities such as immigration reform? [SEP] All right. On the first question, traditionally, State insurance commissioners make decisions about what plans can be or cannot be sold, how they interact with insurers. What we're essentially saying is, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the factor in what happens with folks in the individual market. And my guess is, right away you're going to see a number of State insurance commissioners exercise it.Part of the challenge is, the individual markets are different in different States. There are some States that have individual insurance markets that already have almost all the consumer protections that the Affordable Care Act does. They match up pretty good. It's not some big jump for folks to move into the marketplace. In others, they're pretty low standards, so you can sell pretty substandard plans in those markets. And that's where people might see a bigger jump in their premiums.So I think there's going to be some State-by-State evaluation on how this is handled. But the key point is, is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who received these notices: Look, I, the President of the United States, and the insurance—that the insurance model, the Affordable Care Act, is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have. Now, as I said, there are still going to be some folks who over time, I think, are going to find that the marketplaces are better.One way I described this to—I met with a group of Senators when this issue first came up, and it's not a perfect analogy, but we made a decision as a society that every car has to have a seatbelt or airbags. And so you pass a regulation. And there are some additional costs, particularly at the start of increasing the safety and protections, but we make a decision as a society that the costs are outweighed by the benefits of all the lives that are saved. So what we're saying now is, if you're buying a new car, you got to have a seatbelt.Well, the problem with the grandfather clause that we put in place is it's almost like we said to folks, you got to buy a new car, even if you can't afford it right now. And sooner or later, folks are going to start trading in their old cars. But we don't need—if their life circumstance is such where, for now at least, they want to keep the old car, even if the new car is better, we should be able to give them that option.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, for several years you have been saying that America will stay the course in Iraq; you were committed to the policy. And now you say that, no, you're not saying, stay the course, that you're adapting to win, that you're showing flexibility. And as you mentioned, out of Baghdad, we're now hearing about benchmarks and timetables from the Iraqi Government, as relayed by American officials, to stop the sectarian violence.In the past, Democrats and other critics of the war who talked about benchmarks and timetables were labeled as defeatists, defeatocrats, or people who wanted to cut and run. So why shouldn't the American people conclude that this is nothing from you other than semantic, rhetorical games and all politics 2 weeks before an election? [SEP] David, there is a significant difference between benchmarks for a government to achieve and a timetable for withdrawal. You're talking about—when you're talking about the benchmarks, he's talking about the fact that we're working with the to have certain benchmarks to meet as a way to determine whether or not they're making the hard decisions necessary to achieve peace. I believe that's what you're referring to. And we're working with the to come up with benchmarks.Listen, this is a sovereign government. It was elected by the people of Iraq. What we're asking them to do is to say, when do you think you're going to get this done, when can you get this done, so the people themselves in Iraq can see that the Government is moving forward with a reconciliation plan and plans necessary to unify this Government.That is substantially different, David, from people saying, We want a time certain to get out of Iraq. As a matter of fact, the benchmarks will make it more likely we win. Withdrawing on an artificial timetable means we lose.Now, I'm giving the speech—you're asking me why I'm giving this speech today— because there's—I think I owe an explanation to the American people—and will continue to make explanations. The people need to know that we have a plan for victory.

Well, I just heard about it. This is just a continuation of the witch hunt. It's Democrat stuff. They failed with Mueller. They failed with everything. They failed with Congress. They failed at every stage of the game.This has been going on for 3½, 4 years. Even before I got in, this was starting with the Mueller deal. Mueller started a little bit after, but it started with some of the people that you know very well, the names—Strzok and Page and all of the different people—Comey.This has been going on.

{"sentence": "Q. The good will between you gentlemen is very evident. President Lula, it is also evident the effort to advance with the Doha round. If the Doha round has not reached its success, Brazil, does it have a B plan? [SEP] Well, I have said to all the heads of state in government that I have been in contact and on—to President Bush, to Tony Blair, and to Chancellor Angela Merkel, to Prodi, Prime Minister Prodi, and to President Chirac—with all I have been talking to, I have said that the Doha round is not important only for Brazil; it's not important only for the United States; it's important so that we can guarantee hope around the world, and especially the certainty that we will have more peace in the world.Brazil is a competitive country in agriculture. Brazil, today, exports—50 percent of its exports are semi-industrialized goods. And so we do have the conditions—competitiveness conditions. President Bush knows, and I know, and I believe that all the leaders know that when we talk about agreements at the WTO, we are making an endeavor at the Doha round—we are working especially so that the less-developed countries could have an opportunity, a chance. Of course, we can improve our relations when Brazil makes decisions about industrialized products or in the service industry. Of course, we could improve when the United States takes a position about what kind of subsidy will be reduced, or the European Union could say if they're going to accept or not agricultural goods— reduce the subsidy so that the markets of the less-developed countries could have market access to Europe.If we don't reach an agreement, Brazil will continue to follow the path that it's followed: working, producing more, and selling and also buying. But certainly, those that will suffer more will be those don't— that don't even have the opportunity to participate in the meetings that other countries have the power to do so.I have made these appeals, and I believe that that's why I said, to leaving here, Camp David; I'm leaving here very satisfied because this was an extraordinary and productive meeting, because I heard from— the intention of the American Government on this issue. Our is—we have full willingness, and I believe that if we work together, the U.S. and Brazil, to try to convince our European partners—I believe that we can reach an agreement.And I believe that, in this case, there's no B plan. Either we have the A plan, or there's no agreement. And if there's no agreement, certainly, we will not have winners or losers; everybody will lose. Everybody will lose, the rich, because they will be liable for what will happen in a poorest world. All our trade discussions have centered on completing Doha. It's the only discussions I've had with the President. I've been asked about plan B's before, on different subjects. And that kind of means you're willing to retreat. I'm a plan-A man, just like the President is. Let's get the job done.And for the United States, we're willing to reduce our agricultural subsidies in a substantial way. We understand. On the other hand, we expect our goods and services—whether they be agricultural goods or manufactured goods and services—to be given access to markets. The interesting thing is, is that Brazil is a strong exporter, and it's in Brazil's interest that their goods and services be—have access to markets as well.This is a difficult negotiations because there's a variety of interests. And step one is—to be successful in this complex negotiations, is there a genuine desire to succeed? In other words, are people just showing up for the sake of showing up, or are people actually coming to the table with a genuine desire to succeed? I assured the President again that the United States has a genuine desire to succeed in these talks. I do, because I believe that, one, I think the world has a tendency, at times, to become isolationist and protectionist. In other words, there's that movement, that isolationist movement can become prevalent. And if that were to happen, it would make the world a lot more unstable, and it would make the world more poor.I'm going to repeat what I told you earlier: Ours is a very compassionate nation. We deeply care about the human condition around the world. And I firmly believe that the best way to alleviate world poverty is through trade. That's what I believe. It's not the only way, but it is the best start— let me put it to you that way—coupled with health initiatives that we're working on, food initiatives that the President described. But if you're genuinely interested in eliminating poverty—and I am—commerce, trade, opportunity, and hope will all flourish with a completion of the Doha round.So we are seriously involved. Now, what we won't do is accept a unilateral deal. And the President has never asked us to do that; that's not his intention. His intention is, we want to work together to make sure all are treated fairly. I certainly hope that's the case with the rest of our potential trading partners and our negotiating partners, that they don't expect the United States to carry the entire load in making sure the agreement moves forward.And so we strategized together. Our— the ministers will talk a lot. Ambassador Schwab stayed behind in Sao Paulo to converse with her counterparts. There is a lot of work going on. And I believe there's a good chance we can complete the round. And so therefore, your plan B will be irrelevant—[]—I hope.Environment/British Military Personnel Held in", "label": "Explicit"}

It was a 'he said, she said' situation with no concrete leads for the FBI to pursue. Besides, as Joe Biden himself has stated, such investigations aren't typically within the FBI's purview. The Democrats are simply playing political games, knowing full well Kavanaugh's qualifications. They are attempting to smear a good man and his family for political gain.

Everyone's looking for a better deal, especially with multiple parties involved. And in an election year, you can bet some folks will try to score political points. That being said, I'm confident we'll get it done because it's the right thing to do. It's good for America, good for the region, good for the world. This is the fastest-growing part of the world, a huge market for the U.S. Most countries here already sell their stuff to us with relatively low tariffs, while our goods face significantly higher tariffs there. So, a deal that eliminates 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods in these markets is a win for American businesses and workers. Historically, trade deals have been criticized for exposing us to countries with lower wages and lax labor and environmental standards. But TPP includes enforceable commitments to raise labor standards and address environmental problems. This allows us to engage with countries like Vietnam on these issues. I haven't seen a credible argument that TPP will make us worse off. We'll demonstrably be better off. American workers and businesses will benefit. The politics will be noisy, like with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian free trade agreements I inherited. But we got those done, and we'll get this done too, despite the bumps along the way. As for currency manipulation, TPP includes provisions for transparency and reporting. Some argue for enforceable provisions allowing us to impose tariffs if currency is devalued. But it's hard to determine when currency is being manipulated. Binding other countries on monetary policy would mean binding our Federal Reserve, which we won't do. We've strengthened provisions to put folks on notice if we think they're engaging in competitive devaluations. Finally, regarding the Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, his death has been confirmed. He targeted U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. This doesn't represent a shift in our approach. We're not re-entering combat operations. Our job is to help Afghanistan secure itself.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasn't a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesn't want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo.What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear procedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide? [SEP] Well, first of all, my top priority in each and every one of these situations is to make sure that we're apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way that's consistent with due process of law; and that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way that's consistent with rule of law.And frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be some times where a military commission may be appropriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies--Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations--to think through on a case-by-case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with.And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not going to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And that's always going to be the priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions.But I think it's important to understand, and the American people need to be assured, that any time we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that we're able to obtain actionable intelligence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that you're suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, could you explain us from your point of view why it's not possible to agree on a no-spy agreement, which was, as we understood, proposed by the U.S. Government last summer? What kind of assurances could you give Chancellor Merkel with regard not only to ordinary German citizens, but to government members—some of them sitting here—that they are not under U.S. surveillance anymore?[The reporter continued in German, which was translated as follows.]And, Chancellor, the question addressed to you: When the French President was here a few weeks ago, after his talk with President Obama, he said that trust as regards to the NSA discussion has been rebuilt. Couldn't you say the same thing? [SEP] It's not quite accurate to say that the U.S. Government offered a no-spy agreement and then withdrew it. I think that what is accurate to say is, is that we do not have a blanket no-spy agreement with any country, with any of our closest partners. What we do have are a series of partnerships and procedures and processes that are built up between the various intelligence agencies.And what we are doing with the Germans—as we're doing with the French, as we do with the British or the Canadians or anybody—is to work through what exactly the rules are governing the relationship between each country and make sure that there are no misunderstandings. And I think that we have gone a long way in closing some of the gaps, but as Chancellor Merkel said, there are still some gaps that need to be worked through.But I think what we can be confident about is that the basic approach that we take with Germany is similar to the approach that we take with all our allies and all our friends and that during the course of the last several years as technology advanced, I think there was a danger in which traditional expectations tipped over because of new technologies. And what we've tried to do is make sure that our policies now reflect increased capabilities and, as a consequence, increased dangers of intrusions in privacy.But let me put it this way: Our interest in working effectively with the Germans and to making sure that German governments as well as the German people feel confident about what we do is as important to us as any other country. Germany is at the top of our list in terms of friends and allies and colleagues, and so we're not holding back from doing something with Germany that we somehow do with somebody else. I think the whole debate, Mr.—[inaudible]—has shown that the situation is such that we have a few difficulties yet to overcome. So this is why there's going to be this cyber dialogue between our two countries, and this is also why there needs to be and will have to be more than just business as usual. I mean, looking at the discussion not only in the German Parliament, but also among members of the German Government and also in the German public, we need to do that.But it's very good that we have taken these first steps, and what's still dividing us—issues, for example, of proportionality, and the like—will be addressed. We will work on this, and it's going to be on the agenda for the next few weeks to come. Thank you very much, everybody.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned climate change already. And at the time of the signing of the deal in Paris, you said it was potentially a turning point for the world. But this was a deal that was—that is not a legally binding document. And you bypassed Congress pretty much completely. Are you worried at this point that a Republican President who might take over from you in the White House could stop the deal in its tracks entirely? And considering that possibility, are you more interested in campaigning for a Democratic nominee, considering that danger? [SEP] I think it's fair, I was going to be campaigning for a Democratic nominee[]even without that danger. And I am very confident that we're going to have a terrific Democratic nominee and[] . whose phone is that, guys? Come on, now. [] Somebodyyou recognize your ring. Don't be embarrassed. Just turn it off. [] There you go. Okay. Can I still hear it? All right, I think it's off now.I think we will have a strong Democratic nominee. I think that Democratic nominee will win. I think I will have a Democratic successor. And I will campaign very hard to make that happen, for a whole variety of reasons, because they're far more likely to share my fundamental vision about where America should go.But having said that, what I think people should also feel good about is that the agreement struck in Paris, although not legally binding when it comes to the targets that had been set, does create this architecture in which all around the world, countries are saying, this is where we're going. We're going to be chasing after this clean energy future. This is how we're going to meet our goals. We're going to double down on solar power. We're going to double down on wind power. We're going to invest more heavily in biofuels. We're going to figure out battery technologies.And what you saw in this budget, which I think was really significant, was an extension of the solar tax credits and wind tax credits that we had helped to really boost early on in my administration and that had resulted in wind power increasing threefold, solar power increasing by twentyfold.Those tax credits are now going to be extended for 5 to 7 years. And as a consequence, that combination of market signals means that the private sector is going to start investing much more heavily. They know this is coming. And it's not just coming here, it's coming around the world. So you now have a global marketplace for clean energy that is stable and accelerating over the course of the next decade.That then creates a different dynamic that is independent of what Congress does, but also helps to shape what Congress does. Because the more people that are now getting jobs in solar installation and production, the more that you have companies who are seeing how American innovation can sell products in clean energy all across the Asia-Pacific and in Europe and in Africa, suddenly, there's a big monetary incentive to getting this right.And that's been the history of environmental progress in this country, and now we've exported it around the world. Every time we've made a decision, You know what, we're going to have clean air, the predictions were, everything would fall apart. And lo and behold, it turns out that American innovation makes getting clean air a lot less expensive than people expected and it happens a lot faster than expected.When we made a decision that we were going to double fuel efficiency standards on cars, everybody said, oh, this is going to ruin the American auto industry. The American auto industry has been booming over the last couple years. Acid rain: When George H.W. Bush instituted a system to charge for the emissions that were causing acid rain, everybody said, well, you can't do that, that's going to ruin business. And it turned out it was smoother, faster, quicker, better. And acid rainfolks who were bornI don't know, some of you reporters are getting younger, or I'm getting oldermay not remember it, but that was a big deal. Now most folks don't even remember it anymore, because it got solved. And there's no reason why the same won't happen here.Now, do I think that there's going to be a lot of noise and campaigning next year about how we're going to stop Paris in its tracks? There will probably be a lot of noise like that. Do I actually think that, 2 years from now, 3 years from now, even Republican Members of Congress are going to look at it and say, that's a smart thing to do? I don't think they will.Keep in mind that right now the American Republican Party is the only major party that I can think of in the advanced world that effectively denies climate change. I mean, it's an outlier. Thatmany of the key signatories to this deal, the architects of this deal, come from center-right governments. Even the far-right parties in many of these countries, now they may not like immigrants, for example, but they admit, yes, the science tells us we've got to do something about climate change.So Imy sense is, is that this is something that may be an advantage in terms of short-term politics in a Republican primary.

He's going to be building a billion-dollar plant in Alabama. We had the press—I left them in there. Always a risky thing to do. But if you see, let's say we ask, you know, answered 15 questions, and they were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now, in terms of their investment. They have done a fantastic job. These are some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I'm not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they've done is incredible. But Mr. Patel, who's the biggest steel—I think biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual. But I think he's the biggest steel company by a lot. He's investing billions of dollars in the United States, and he's only doing it because of what I've done to bring back the steel industry. The steel industry was dead. Absolutely dead in the United States. And now it's a vibrant industry. It's incredible, and we need it. Again, we need it for defense.

And what I'm going to do is to hope that, in part, this debate has focused the American people's attention a little bit more and will subject Congress to scrutiny. And I think increasingly the American people are going to say to themselves, you know what, if a party or a politician is constantly taking the position my way or the high way, constantly being locked into ideologically rigid positions, that we're going to remember at the polls.It's kind of cumulative.

We reviewed this matter thoroughly at the time and remain confident in our position. Our party is committed to upholding the law, both in its letter and as it has been historically interpreted. During the last election, we operated in accordance with established legal precedents. Should those interpretations evolve, we will, of course, adapt accordingly, ensuring that the same standards are applied to all political parties. [In French, then translated:] As I mentioned previously, Elections Canada contends that some of our local expenditures should be considered national expenses. We disagree with this assessment, which is why we have pursued legal recourse.

We're also making incredible progress on other fronts. We're on the verge of a historic peace deal in the Middle East, something nobody thought was possible. And let's not forget Nord Stream 2 – I was the first to call out Germany for funding Russia's energy dominance.

Democrats and Republicans can disagree, argue, but still find common ground. We did it with taxes. I still think tax cuts for the wealthy are wrong when we have deficits. We'll disagree on spending.

What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.I've seen people with only good intention. They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place.

I don't have a clear recollection of ordering one. I do remember being quite frustrated with the constant leaks. You in the press are always digging for information, which is understandable, but the leaking of classified documents is a serious matter. It's a persistent problem, not unique to this administration. We've had numerous leaks, some from unknown origins, so I won't speculate on the source. It's notoriously difficult to find the leaker.

Additionally, President Vazquez, did you broach the subject of the mill plant dispute with Argentina and request President Bush's intervention? [SEP] We dedicated a significant portion of our discussion to addressing Uruguay's concerns regarding market access for specific products. The President articulated various trade-related issues, including concerns about quotas imposed on items such as cows and sheep. I assured him that I would give due consideration to the requests he articulated. You may have perceived my remarks about blueberries as facetious, but I assure you they were not. Uruguay produces exceptional blueberries, and the fundamental question is whether their producers will be afforded the opportunity to market their product within the United States. We engaged in discussions regarding a variety of agricultural products, and I emphasized that identifying and addressing problems requires open and transparent communication. We will provide assistance where feasible, and where not, I will furnish a comprehensive explanation. I also harbor concerns regarding protectionist tendencies, both domestically and internationally. I firmly believe that a world characterized by free and equitable trade is more likely to effectively combat poverty. Consequently, I am a staunch advocate for the successful completion of the Doha round of the WTO. I shared our strategies for advancing the Doha round with President Lula, being careful not to divulge any confidential information. The United States is prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies, contingent upon securing market access for our products. I remain optimistic that we can achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. Our trade minister, Susan Schwab, remains in Sao Paulo engaging in discussions with her Brazilian counterpart. In response to your initial question, I fully concur with the sentiments expressed by President Bush. We have established a platform, commencing with this meeting, where our experts and ministers will engage in discussions and make progress on matters pertaining to bilateral relations. Uruguay has consistently advocated for free trade and the reduction of tariffs and subsidies. We are also exploring the possibility of making progress with the GSP.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, considering the ongoing tunnel operations, is a genuine ceasefire achievable at this juncture? Should we adjust our strategy moving forward? [SEP] Well, let's remember the proposed ceasefire allowed Israel to continue dismantling those tunnel networks, and they can do so without leveling Gaza's population centers. Dismantling those tunnels is absolutely necessary. There's a way to do it while minimizing bloodshed. Past conflicts have shown the devastating costs. The images we've seen – children, defenseless women, Israelis living in fear – are heartbreaking. A ceasefire that safeguards Israel's security, ensures they aren't constantly threatened by rockets, and acknowledges the Palestinian need for a decent life is crucial. It's a tough challenge, filled with anger and despair, but we must persevere. American leadership means stepping up when others won't. While these crises may pose tangential risks to the US, like ISIS, they aren't direct attacks. We intervene because of our unique responsibilities. We must be humble about our limitations, recognizing our finite resources after a decade of war. But we try. When John Kerry works to broker peace, we should support him, not criticize his efforts prematurely. No other nation is making such efforts. Our involvement usually leads to better outcomes, not perfect or immediate, but better. This applies to the Middle East, Ukraine, and Iraq. I'll conclude by reminding everyone that during my first term, the focus was on the economy and job creation. Our actions worked, and the economy improved.

Huawei is not welcome here. And I've made this clear to European countries and others. Australia has been fantastic. But Huawei isn't coming here. We've warned certain countries considering Huawei that they can use them, but we won't share intelligence. And they've all backed away.

[SEP] Well, let's be clear. Closing Guantanamo has always been a stated goal, but it's not as simple as snapping your fingers. We face resistance from other nations unwilling to repatriate detainees – nobody wants these folks. And frankly, the Senate isn't exactly clamoring to house them here either. As for progress, we *are* working to transfer detainees, ensuring humane treatment upon return. Trials are a priority, but the legal complexities are immense.

We've been in very close contact with China, including myself with President Xi. He very much wanted this to happen. He wanted this to get out and finished and be done. He worked—he's been working very, very hard, I can tell you that. And they're making a lot of progress in China.You probably saw Starbucks are now opened again.

Would you care to use this opportunity to condemn the actions of your supporters in Portland?

Also, regarding Cuba, did you discuss the 45-day waiting period for removing them from the state sponsor of terrorism list with President Castro, and do you believe there are no impediments to opening embassies once they are removed? [SEP] Okay, one last try on Iran. We have a political framework with Iran and the P-5-plus-1. Some parts, like centrifuge reductions in Natanz, are very specific. Others are just intentions, and the details matter. How we interpret those details will be negotiated. It's wrong to say everything's done. We have a framework that, if implemented, will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But the details are key, and there will be tough negotiations. That's what I said from the start. On Cuba, we didn't get into that level of detail. The state sponsor of terrorism recommendation is coming to me. Congress can review it too. The Embassy concerns are mostly on Cuba's side. They haven't had an American Embassy in a while. We're used to this, like with China and Vietnam. We're ready to move forward and improve dialogue, which will improve prospects for the Cuban people.

That's one reason I go out of my way to constantly thank the family members. I'm talking to our commanders. Their job is to tell me what the situation is on the ground.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, surveys indicate that inflation is a top concern for Black voters. In the next two years, what concrete assurances can you provide to improve their financial well-being, while simultaneously averting a potential recession? [SEP] Well, let's consider the facts. Black unemployment has decreased significantly under my administration. The number of Black-owned small businesses is at an all-time high. We are also providing downpayment assistance for home purchases through the Small Business Administration, as homeownership is the primary means of wealth accumulation for most middle-class families. While I cannot guarantee the complete eradication of inflation, I believe we can make significant progress. We have already reduced gasoline prices by over a dollar per gallon. However, the oil companies are not acting in the nation's best interest. Six of them collectively generated over $100 billion in profits last quarter. Historically, they would have either invested in expanding refinery capacity or passed on savings to gas stations, but they are not doing so now. We are also addressing the costs that disproportionately impact families, such as prescription drug prices. We are implementing measures to lower these prices substantially, beginning next year. For instance, we are capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month. We are focused on reducing all of the expenses that families face on a monthly basis – from mortgage payments to food costs to gasoline prices to medical bills. We have already enacted legislation to address these issues, and it is beginning to take effect. I am optimistic because we are continuing to experience growth at a sustainable pace, and we are not currently in a recession. I am confident that we can achieve what economists refer to as a soft landing, gradually reducing prices without triggering an economic downturn.", "label": "Deflection"}

You gotta be able to sit down and talk straight, without blowing up the whole relationship. We see eye-to-eye on some stuff, like fighting terrorists and keeping nukes out of the wrong hands. But on other stuff, like how they treat the press, we're miles apart. But that's why you gotta keep talking. As for Russia changing, that's their business.

We're fighting against these hateful bills targeting transgender children. These are our kids, our neighbors.

Framework works if we do it right, stops the bomb, but details are key. Tough talks ahead, like I said. Cuba: didn't talk details. I'll look at the list, Congress will too.

Nobody else has any say in it. And frankly, I think his decision will depend on how he's feeling that day. He might want to talk about strategic issues, but who knows what he's really thinking? Even his own advisors probably don't know. We've had meetings, but they haven't been very productive. If he wants to invade, he'll have to wait for the ground to freeze.

However, I want to assure everyone that my administration will operate with the utmost integrity, adhering to the rule of law and respecting human rights. We do not engage in torture, we comply with the Geneva Conventions, and we uphold due process, even as we vigorously pursue those who threaten our nation. These principles are not mutually exclusive; they reinforce each other. While no one is above the law and clear instances of wrongdoing should be addressed, my primary focus is on looking ahead and uniting our nation.

Then again, it's possible it still wouldn't have been. We could have had a completely new environmental review process, and they still might have said, this meets industry standards. That's what this commission needs to determine. Was this a systemic failure? Or a one-in-a-million occurrence? What are the inherent risks? The fact that oil companies now have to drill a mile underwater and then another 3 miles below that tells us something about the oil industry.

Was this decision driven by genuine concern for Sergeant Bergdahl's well-being, or were there other political considerations at play, such as bolstering your legacy or expediting the closure of Guantanamo? [SEP] The suggestion that this was about anything other than bringing an American soldier home is frankly offensive. Sergeant Bergdahl was in dire straits. We had an opportunity to get him back, and we took it. The released Taliban are being monitored, and we're confident in our ability to address any potential threats. This was about fulfilling our sacred obligation to leave no one behind, a principle that transcends politics.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "In your assessment, what was the key takeaway from last week's election results? And is there still an opportunity to implement the 'course correction' you alluded to before critical decisions are made by our European allies? [SEP] The American people, I believe, recognize the interconnectedness of the modern world. The forces of globalization are irreversible. They understand that their professional lives, or those of their children, may be characterized by greater fluidity, requiring adaptability, continuous learning, and reskilling. They are, I believe, prepared for this reality, provided that the rules of engagement are equitable. While a majority of Americans continue to support international trade, they harbor concerns regarding fairness and reciprocity in market access. There is a prevailing anxiety about a potential race to the bottom in terms of wages and labor standards. I previously advocated, albeit unsuccessfully, for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, arguing that it would address these concerns by strengthening labor and environmental protections, leveling the playing field, and ultimately benefiting American workers and businesses. However, this argument faces resistance given the collective memory of plant closures and offshoring. Thus, the election results reflect a desire for a change in direction. Rhetoric focused on curbing immigration surges and opposing unfair trade agreements resonated with voters. As we transition to governance, a more nuanced approach is required. We must ensure an orderly and lawful immigration process, recognizing that immigration, when properly managed, contributes to economic vitality, dynamism, and entrepreneurship. Historically, America's success has been predicated on these factors. Regarding trade, severing existing agreements, such as the one with Mexico, is not a straightforward solution. Global supply chains are deeply integrated. Components sourced from Mexico enable automotive plants to maintain operations and even expand production. Therefore, it is incumbent upon progressives to acknowledge and address legitimate anxieties, offering concrete solutions such as a higher minimum wage, stronger worker protections, robust financial regulations, and trade agreements that prohibit exploitative labor practices. Addressing inequality is also paramount. This constitutes our strategic imperative. And I am confident that we can achieve success. The world will continue to look to the United States for leadership. Our example matters. The path to ensuring that all citizens benefit from the global economy lies not in isolationism, but in enhanced international cooperation.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. June was the deadliest month for U.S. troops in— since we began the war in Afghanistan. Has Afghanistan replaced Iraq as the central front of the war on terror? And is Al Qaida and the Taliban taking the upper hand? And also, is it possible that we could send additional U.S. troops there sooner than the 2009 date that you've been talking about? [SEP] First of all, any time a troop loses their life, whether it be in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere, our hearts go out to their families. And I am so appreciative that, in a time of danger, Americans are willing to step up and volunteer and sacrifice.Secondly, it has been a tough month in Afghanistan, but it's also been a tough month for the Taliban. You know, one reason why there have been more deaths is because our troops are taking the fight to a tough enemy. You know, an enemy who doesn't like our presence there because they don't like the idea of America denying safe haven. America is pressing an ideology that's opposite of theirs, and so of course there's going to be resistance.I am confident that the strategy is going to work, which is to confront the Taliban, confront elements of Al Qaida, and, at the same time, encourage the growth of a free society by good economic policy, good education policy, and good health policy.We're constantly reviewing troop needs, troop levels. We're halfway through 2008; as I said, we're going to increase the troops by 2009. One thing, however, that you've got to understand is that we have doubled Afghan troops—coalition troops have doubled from 2 years ago. So there is an active presence, and there are more troops there than there were.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given the evolving situation in Ukraine and the potential for renewed discussions with President Putin, what specific objectives will guide your approach? Furthermore, considering President Zelenskyy's stated condition of Crimea's return for any negotiation, do you see this as a realistic and achievable demand at this juncture? [SEP] The clear and direct path to resolving this conflict is for Putin to completely withdraw his forces from Ukraine. However, it appears he is unwilling to do so, despite the significant consequences and the devastating impact he is inflicting. I currently have no immediate plans to engage with Mr. Putin directly. I am prepared to consider discussions if he demonstrates a genuine and demonstrable interest in finding a way to bring an end to the conflict, and if such discussions are conducted in close coordination with our allied partners. As of this moment, he has not taken such steps. It is absolutely critical that we continue to provide unwavering support to the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom and sovereignty. The notion that Putin could somehow prevail over Ukraine is simply beyond comprehension. He has fundamentally miscalculated the situation from the very beginning. He mistakenly believed that he would be greeted with open arms by the Russian-speaking populations within Ukraine. I urge you to revisit his address at the time of the invasion. He expressed a desire to emulate Peter the Great. He emphasized the supposed significance of Kyiv as the historical and cultural heartland of Russian identity. He has been proven wrong on every single count. Therefore, the fundamental question that must be addressed is this: how does he extricate himself from the predicament he has created? I am prepared, should he be willing to engage in meaningful dialogue, to ascertain what his objectives are and what he is prepared to do to achieve a peaceful resolution. However, I will only proceed in close consultation and collaboration with our NATO allies. I will not act unilaterally or independently. Regarding your specific question concerning the preconditions established by President Zelenskyy, I believe it is essential for us to recognize that, as Ukraine continues to resist the ongoing aggression, enduring war crimes and attacks on its civilian infrastructure while simultaneously undertaking a courageous counteroffensive, President Zelenskyy has presented a comprehensive 10-point peace plan that deserves serious consideration. I firmly believe that we must maintain our engagement with him and his government, as Ukraine has demonstrated a genuine and unwavering commitment to addressing these critical issues. We acknowledge and commend this commitment to finding a peaceful resolution. For a number of years, I had the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, which were designed to de-escalate the conflict in the region. During the most recent meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, which was the only such meeting to take place, in December 2019, I was present alongside Chancellor Merkel. I can personally attest to the fact that I witnessed a President Zelenskyy who was genuinely sincere in his willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and negotiations. From the time of his election until May of the following year, President Zelenskyy consistently demonstrated a strong desire to participate in discussions and negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful resolution. It was President Putin who harbored the desire to initiate and wage war, and I personally observed this during my visits to both Russia and Ukraine in early February. Consequently, it is entirely legitimate and reasonable for President Zelenskyy to establish certain conditions for negotiations to proceed. We must work diligently to identify the elements that could pave the way for a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement, but it is ultimately his prerogative to inform us when the time is right and to articulate the choices that are available to the Ukrainian people. Having stated this, I will continue to engage with President Putin, as necessary. In fact, we addressed this very matter this morning with President Biden, as we consistently strive to prevent escalation and to achieve tangible and meaningful results. I will engage with him regarding the security and safety of nuclear facilities in the contested regions, with particular emphasis on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Over the past several months, we have undertaken significant efforts at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA, are continuing to conduct important and essential work to ensure its safety and security.

{"sentence": "Q. Oh, thank you. You mentioned climate activists before, and I want to ask something about them. You're touting agreements. Other world leaders have touted agreements. But the atmosphere around the conference here is skeptical, and it's pretty angry.Climate activists feel like decades and decades of COPs have led to broken promises. And they feel like even if all of these goals are reached that you're talking about in the last few days, it's just not enough right now.And I'm wondering what you would say to the people outside who are really angry at this conference, especially at this moment where Joe Manchin has expressed—you know, has created more doubt that your climate legislation will pass. And you've got a very conservative Supreme Court about to take a look at whether your EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions. What's your message to people outside who just worry this all isn't enough right now, given the crisis? [SEP] Well, first of all, I think anyone who is focused on the environment should be worried. We've got a lot more to do beyond what we've done. We've done more than we've ever done though; that's the point. And more has to be done.And I don't find—I didn't have a single member of the—this conference come up to me and say: Are you going to pass what you have? And what do you think is—how is that going to affect it? And what are you going to do? What they're looking at is what, in fact, has happened in terms of everything from dealing with deforestation to what we're going to do on Build Back Better and how we've been able to focus now.I mean, when is the last time you heard world leaders sit down together and agree that what they're going to do is, when they deal with the needs of the infrastructure of other countries, that they're going to focus, first and foremost, on whether or not what the climatic—what the climate impact is on that?So I think—look, this is a—there's a reason for people to be worried. I'm worried. I'm worried if we don't continue to move forward and make the kind of progress we're now making, that it's going to—I mean, we—we throw into jeopardy the prospect that we're going to be able to keep the temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius.But I'm optimistic because I think there's a—how can I say it? I guess maybe the best way to say it to you, Scott, is: What I feel is that the populations of each of our countries have a different perspective than they did at COP25.I think there is—I mean, not because of necessarily any of the leaders of any of our countries, including mine—that all of a sudden, people are seeing these things happening they never thought would happen.They're seeing people drown in their basements in Queens, New York, because of flooding and rain. They're seeing that, you know, more territory burned down in the United States, just since the first of the year, than—it makes up the entire landmass of the State of New Jersey. They've seen a hurricane with a hundred—top winds of 178 miles an hour.I mean—so they're looking at these things. They're seeing more—the waters warming. They're seeing a whole range of things occurring around the world that haven't happened. And it's, sort of, like, Whoa, whoa.Because I don't get what I used to get when I started—I don't—there's no reason why anyone would remember this, but back when a fine Republican, a guy named Dick Lugar, was—from the State of Indiana—and he and I were either the chairmen or ranking members of the Foreign Relations Committee. This was over 20 years ago. We ended up proposing—and it worked, but it got no enthusiasm—a thing for debt-for-nature swaps. And people looked at us like: What in the hell are you doing? Why are you forgiving the debt so Brazil won't, you know, burn down more of their forest? Or, Why are you doing that so they will do—now everybody goes: Whoa. What else can you do? What else can you do?So I think there's a whole different attitude that's out there. And I think this is being led—and I'm not being solicitous here—I think this is being led by, you know, my granddaughters and their friends, that generation. I think they're out there going whoa, and they're having a profound impact—having a profound impact on their parents and their grandparents about what's happening.And then all these climactic and—climatic things have happened that they—that people are now paying attention like they never did before.So, you know, there's a lot more to do. And it's going to determine whether or not we are going to be able to fund what we're talking about.But, for example, even if the funding didn't come from some of the governments, you have the private sector now engaged, where they're talking about investing—literally, the need to invest over trillions of dollars off the sidelines. It's bankers that are now deciding they've got to—I talked, a long time ago, with you all about—that you have major corporate America pricing in the price of carbon.

Furthermore, will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials indicted last week by a U.S. grand jury? [SEP] Let me address the core of your question. The notion of Russian interference has been amplified, I believe, to explain a loss that should not have occurred. The electoral college system, as you know, favors the Democrats. Yet, victory eluded them. As for collusion, there was none. I had no prior acquaintance with President Trump, and there was no coordination with his campaign. The individuals mentioned in these allegations, even if their actions are as described, were not involved in the campaign. Now, regarding the question of trust, it is not about whether President Trump trusts me or I trust him. It is about defending the interests of our respective nations and finding common ground where possible. Accusations of collusion are baseless and lack factual support. We must be guided by facts, not rumors. As for the 12 individuals, I will examine the matter. We have a treaty with the United States that facilitates cooperation in criminal cases. We can offer to allow Special Attorney Mueller's commission to question these individuals, provided that the United States reciprocates by allowing us to question officials related to illegal activities on Russian soil.

Even if folks disagree about Iraq, we're in a global fight for values. You don't win by being a fair-weather friend, hesitating when it's tough, or losing heart when the enemy is strong. We share values, and that's key. We both face tough press questions, which shows that. It's about democracy, freedom, accountability. Sure, attacking America gets applause in Europe. But what matters is fighting for those values. We can debate past mistakes, but our enemy is watching. Are we standing firm, or will we back down when it's hard? That's leadership.

On the Middle East and as it relates to American politics, a little less than a year ago Muammar Qadhafi gave a speech, and he said he was going to send his forces to Benghazi, he was going to rout opponents from their bedrooms, and he was going to shoot them. You frequently cited that speech as a justification for NATO, the no-fly zone, and military action against Libya. In Syria, Bashar al-Asad is killing people. There's a massacre underway.

How do you respond to those criticisms? [SEP] All right, Mike, you've asked a couple of questions there, so let me--let's start with the Iran situation since that's been the topic in the news for the last few days.When I came into office, Iran was unified, on the move, had made substantial progress on its nuclear program, and the world was divided in terms of how to deal with it. What we've been able to do over the last 3 years is mobilize unprecedented, crippling sanctions on Iran. Iran is feeling the bite of these sanctions in a substantial way. The world is unified; Iran is politically isolated.And what I have said is, is that we will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear weapon. My policy is not containment; my policy is to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, because if they get a nuclear weapon, that could trigger an arms race in the region, it would undermine our nonproliferation goals, it could potentially fall into the hands of terrorists. And we've been in close consultation with all our allies, including Israel, in moving this strategy forward.At this stage, it is my belief that we have a window of opportunity where this can still be resolved diplomatically. That's not just my view. That's the view of our top intelligence officials; It's the view of top Israeli intelligence officials. And as a consequence, we are going to continue to apply the pressure even as we provide a door for the Iranian regime to walk through where they could rejoin the community of nations by giving assurances to the international community that they're meeting their obligations and they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.That's my track record. Now, what's said on the campaign trail, those folks don't have a lot of responsibilities. They're not Commander in Chief. And when I see the casualness with which some of these folks talk about war, I'm reminded of the costs involved in war. I'm reminded that the decision that I have to make in terms of sending our young men and women into battle and the impacts that has on their lives, the impact it has on our national security, the impact it has on our economy.This is not a game, and there's nothing casual about it. And when I see some of these folks who have a lot of bluster and a lot of big talk, but when you actually ask them specifically what they would do, it turns out they repeat the things that we've been doing over the last 3 years, it indicates to me that that's more about politics than actually trying to solve a difficult problem.Now, the one thing that we have not done is we haven't launched a war. If some of these folks think that it's time to launch a war, they should say so. And they should explain to the American people exactly why they would do that and what the consequences would be. Everything else is just talk.", "label": "Explicit"}

However, we can pass good laws to speed up the recovery, like housing legislation. Congress needs to get moving. Another signal would be to explore for oil here at home. While we transition away from hydrocarbons, we should be smart about using our resources. A strong effort to develop oil shale reserves would ease pressure on gasoline prices. Also, we haven't built a new refinery in decades, which makes no sense. Permitting is incredibly difficult, discouraging investment. We import a lot of refined product. We can also promote trade. The decision on the Colombia free trade agreement is baffling. Colombia enjoys preferential treatment, yet we don't. Our exports have helped the economy, so expanding trade opportunities makes sense.

[SEP] Thanks, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. I've heard those allegations about political decisionmaking; it's just not true. Secondly, just so you know, I get asked—I mean, I get complaints all the time from Members of Congress on a variety of subjects—this Senator, this Congressperson so-and-so—and there's occasionally frustration with the executive branch. And they will pull me aside and say, Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? And I did receive complaints about U.S. attorneys.I specifically remember one time I went up to the Senate, and Senators were talking about the U.S. attorneys. I don't remember specific names being mentioned, but I did say to Al last year—you're right, last fall, I said, Have you heard complaints about AGs?

{"sentence": "Q. First of all, on Cuba, if I could, two questions. The Cuban Government has frequently said that it cannot allow more political or personal freedoms or press freedoms, because the United States has used both covert and otherwise actions to try to overthrow the Castros. Does your new era, in fact, end regime change efforts by the United States? And should the Cubans then respond by allowing free elections and tolerance of dissent now because of the changed policy?And secondly, on the issue of Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden, of course, said that the Democratic race is wide open. The polls seem to say otherwise. What is your opinion on that? Is the race still wide open? [SEP] Not only have I run my last election, but I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections. That is your job. [] And there's no shortage of people who are happy to opine on that. I will not be one of them.On Cuba, we are not in the business of regime change. We are in the business of making sure the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to participate and shape their own destiny and their own lives and supporting civil society.And there's going to be an evolution, regardless of what we do, inside of Cuba. Partly, it's going to be generational. If you listened to President Castro's comments earlier this morning, a lot of the points he made referenced actions that took place before I was born, and part of my message here is, the cold war is over. There's still a whole lot of challenges that we face and a lot of issues around the world, and we're still going to have serious issues with Cuba on not just the Cuban Government's approach to its own people, but also regional issues and concerns. There are going to be areas where we cooperate as well. Cuban doctors deployed during the Ebola crisis made a difference; Cuban activity in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake made a difference. And so there may be areas of collaboration as well.What I said to President Castro is the same thing that I've said to leaders throughout the region: We have a point of view, and we won't be shy about expressing it. But I'm confident that the way to lift up the values that we care about is through persuasion. And that's going to be the primary approach that we take on a whole host of these issues, primarily because they don't implicate our national security in a direct way.And I think that we have to be very clear: Cuba is not a threat to the United States. That doesn't mean we don't have differences with it. But on the list of threats that I'm concerned about, I think it's fair to say that between ISIL and Iran getting a nuclear weapon and activities in Yemen and Libya and Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine and our—the impact on our allies there—I could go down a pretty long list—climate change. [] So our—I think our approach has to be one of trying to work with the region and other countries and be very clear about what we believe and what we stand for and what we think works and what doesn't.And so often, when we insert ourselves in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive. It backfires. That's been part of our history, and—which is why countries keep on trying to use us as an excuse for their own governance failures. Let's take away the excuse. And let's be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everybody to try to lift up opportunity and prosperity and security for people in the region.Major Garrett [CBS News].", "label": "Implicit"}

As we've seen with Al Qaida, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities. You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act.But what we can do is to make sure that the kind of systemic and broad-based aggression that we've seen out of ISIL that terrorizes primarily Muslims—Shia, Sunni—terrorizes Kurds, terrorizes not just Iraqis, but people throughout the region, that that is degraded to the point where it is no longer the kind of factor that we've seen it being over the last several months. .

I'm wondering what you know of those allegations. And do you intend to stand behind him? [SEP] Well, I haven't heard of the particular allegations, but I will tell you he's one of the finest people that I have met, and I think speaking for Melania, also. He's been the doctor for President Obama, I believe for President Bush, for me. I've gotten to know him pretty well. He's a great doctor.And it was a suggestion.

Furthermore, how difficult was it to advocate for stimulus measures when your own stimulus efforts are currently stalled on Capitol Hill? [SEP] Well, the discussion on stimulus measures was brief, dating back a few G-20 meetings. We explored strategies to stimulate economic growth, which don't always require government spending. The rebalancing agenda, for instance, can significantly boost global demand through necessary adjustments by various countries, without relying on traditional fiscal stimulus. There wasn't a disagreement with the Europeans. They concur on the importance of signaling the strength and viability of the European project, their commitment to the euro, and their determination to resolve the crisis. European leaders themselves acknowledge that this begins with a unified course of action. We've witnessed the implementation of all the necessary elements to address the crisis, which we believe are appropriate. This includes a solution for Greece, involving voluntary debt reduction, continued reforms, and structural changes, despite recent turmoil. The second component is the recapitalization of European banks, which is crucial for market confidence. The third is the creation of a firewall to reassure markets of Europe's commitment to the euro. The details are still being finalized by European leaders. We offered ideas and options for its structure.

Mr. President, concerning the recent attack on the Inter-Continental Hotel, are you concerned that Afghan forces may lack the capacity to effectively defend against such threats, particularly in the capital? [SEP] Well, let's not forget that the troop drawdown has not yet commenced. We have always recognized Afghanistan as a high-risk environment, with the Taliban maintaining a significant presence and the potential for incidents like this to occur. The crucial question is whether Afghan capabilities are improving overall. Kabul, which houses a substantial portion of the Afghan population, has been largely under the control of Afghan forces for a considerable period, and they have generally performed well. Kabul is significantly safer than it once was, and the Afghan forces stationed there are far more capable. However, that does not preclude the possibility of future incidents, which are likely to continue for some time. Our mission is not yet complete. As I stated previously, the tide of war is receding, and we have entered a transition phase. Similar to our experience in Iraq, where we have reduced our troop presence and will complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, while Iraq has managed to maintain a democratic government and reduce violence, we believe a comparable strategy is appropriate in Afghanistan. Even in Iraq, sporadic attacks still occur. These nations are still recovering from extensive war and conflict, making them inherently dangerous.

My view of the economy is that the fundamentals are strong, that we've had strong growth for a reason: that we're competitive; we got flexible workplace; that we kept taxes low; exports are up.Like many Americans, I'm concerned, and I'm concerned about the fact that Americans see their costs going up. I know Americans are concerned about whether or not their neighbor may stay in their house. And so we're dealing with these issues.On the housing front, I made it clear we're not going to bail out lenders, and we're not going to help speculators. But we will help creditworthy people stay in their homes. And that's what Secretary Paulson has done, along with Secretary Jackson, in putting together what's called the HOPE NOW coalition, which has got lenders and financiers and consumer advocates all working together to develop standards to make it more likely a creditworthy person can refinance their home.See, the difficulty we face in the housing market is that the lender, the person who actually made the note, oftentimes doesn't end up owning the note. That note could be—in the recent past has been bundled and sold as an asset. And so there's no telling who owns the mortgage of the person who wants to renegotiate. And so we're helping deal with the new realities in a way that we believe is going to be effective.Secondly, the Congress can really help by passing a FHA modernization bill. The House passed a bill. The Senate passed a bill. They need to get together when they get back, quickly, and get it to my desk so that it makes it easier for the Federal Government, in this case, to help people refinance their homes.In terms of further stimulation, we'll consider all options. And so we're watching carefully.", "label": "Implicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning your $447 billion jobs bill, following two months and numerous pronouncements, the tangible outcomes appear limited, primarily the veterans jobs bill and executive directives. Are you prepared to concede that you may enter the 2012 election cycle without further legislative action on job creation, facing a 9% unemployment rate, and potential questions regarding your leadership? [SEP] The American people, I believe, are currently more concerned with the failure of congressional leadership to enact the jobs bill, despite widespread support for its components, including from many Republicans. This is a significant factor contributing to the current dissatisfaction with Congress. Typically, in a political context, when a substantial majority of the population expresses dissatisfaction with your actions, a shift in approach is warranted. However, this has not occurred in Congress, particularly among Republicans, who do not appear to share the same sense of urgency regarding the need to stimulate job creation. I intend to continue advocating for this bill. I anticipate that we will achieve some progress in the near term, and I will persist until we accomplish all of our objectives. This may extend until November or necessitate a new Congress. The individual components of the bill, such as tax reductions for middle-class families, tax incentives for small businesses that hire veterans or the long-term unemployed, and the reinstatement of teachers in classrooms, are of paramount importance. For example, here in Hawaii, students are attending school only four days a week due to budgetary constraints. How can we effectively compete in the 21st century when our children are essentially receiving part-time education? The jobs bill would alleviate these budgetary pressures at the state level. Furthermore, the revitalization of our infrastructure is essential. Every world leader I engage with emphasizes the critical importance of possessing a world-class infrastructure. When one travels through the Asia-Pacific region, one observes airports and ports that surpass our own. This will inevitably impact our capacity to conduct business, facilitate trade, and export U.S. products manufactured by U.S. workers to the fastest-growing market in the world. Simultaneously, we could generate substantial employment opportunities. Therefore, I will continue to press forward. I anticipate that we will gradually make progress. If you are inquiring as to whether I expect the Republican leadership in the House or the Senate to suddenly acknowledge the validity of my position and adopt all of my proposals, the answer is no. However, I remain hopeful that they will eventually recognize that inaction is not a viable option. This should also be their aspiration, because if they fail to do so, I anticipate a change in congressional leadership.", "label": "Deflection"}

If you got Ebola, that was it.This one is different. Much different. This is a flu. This is like a flu. And this is a much different situation than Ebola.But—and we're working on Ebola right now, by the way. We're working on certain areas of the Congo. The Congo has Ebola and caused largely by the fact that they have war and people can't get there. We can now treat Ebola. In that—at that time, it was infectious, and you couldn't treat it.

Also, a year ago, you said you wanted to close Guantanamo, but nothing's happened. Are you in charge, and will it be open or closed when you leave office? [SEP] I did say closing Guantanamo should be a goal. But the delay is because other countries won't take the prisoners back. We need a place for them to go. Did you see the Senate vote? Almost everyone said they don't want these prisoners here. So, part of the issue is practical: what do we do with them? You say nothing's happened? I disagree. We're working with other countries to send them back. It's hard; nobody wants killers. And we want to treat them humanely when we send them back. We also want trials. The courts are involved, and Defense is working on it. The sooner we get trials going, the better. I can't predict if Guantanamo will be open or closed. It's complicated. I laid out a goal.

[SEP] China's facing some real economic headwinds right now, due to a number of factors, both internal and external. I don't believe this will lead to an invasion of Taiwan; in fact, it may well have the opposite effect. We're not looking to undermine China; a thriving China that adheres to international norms is beneficial for all. However, they've encountered significant economic challenges, particularly in the property sector. They're currently grappling with the necessary course of action, and I won't speculate on the outcome. We're not pursuing a decoupling from China.

What is your opinion of this? And do you think that this helps the unity you've always called for among Mexicans, with regard to the presentation of the bill on energy in our Mexican Congress? [SEP] This kind of attitude can only be compared to the people who are making it. Congress is working normally. There is a responsible attitude on the part of most of the political parties represented therein. People from the PRI, the PAN, the Green Party, the New Alliance, other political parties are working firmly. And I simply deplore this attitude, which only impoverishes the image of those behind it and weakens even more the presence of Mexicans from parties as important as the PRD, which, aside from their own internal crisis, are losing their public image because of the activities of people who simply make them look ridiculous.I hope that our institutional life will be strengthened and that we strengthen dialogue and the capacity for talking among ourselves.This issue that you referred to is already in the hands of the authorities.

Some folks still don't think we should be there, but the conversation's changed. Petraeus and Crocker made a difference. Let's keep funding our troops, that's common sense. We agreed on FISA. Why mess with a law that works? It keeps us safe. That's what people care about. It helps us track Al Qaida. We need to protect those phone companies that helped us, too. So, we're on the same page there. Hopefully, Congress will get moving on some bills. I'm just saying, there's a lot to do. I'm not a politician, but I need Congress to get things done. It's hard to find common ground when nothing's moving. I haven't seen a single appropriations bill. How can we work together without that? We agreed on trade, that's important. Exports helped us out last quarter. Let's open up more markets. But nothing's happening on trade. Veterans are another area.

How long are you prepared to wait to determine whether chemical weapons were used? What happens when you make your determination? And will you take your case to the United Nations? And have you ruled out putting U.S. troops on the ground in Syria? [SEP] Well, first all, I emphasized yesterday, so let me reemphasize: We're not waiting. We're not standing by. We are currently the largest humanitarian donor to deal with the crisis in . We are the largest contributor toof nonlethal aid to the opposition. We've mobilized 80 countries to support the opposition. We are working to apply every pressure point that we can on , working with our international partners.And so we are actively engaged on a day-to-day basis to try to deal with this crisis and to restore a that is respectful of the rights and aspirations of the n people.Now, as I've said before, if in fact we see strong evidence that we can present and that allows us to say that the n military and the n Government is using chemical weapons, then that is a game changer for us because, not only is there the prospect of widespread use of chemical weapons inside of , but there's the possibility that it lands in the hands of organizations like Hizballah.We have evidence that chemical weapons have been used. We don't know when, where, or how they were used. We are initiating on our own to investigate and get a better handle on the facts inside of . We're also working with the international community and our partners to try to get a better handle on what's happening, and we've already gone to the United Nations to say we want a full-blown investigation inside of . So far, for unsurprising reasons, President Asad has resisted.We will stay on this. Now, if in fact there's the kind of systematic use of chemical weapons inside of , we expect that we're going to get additional further evidence. And at that point, absolutely, we will present that to the international community, because I think this is, again, not just an American problem, this is a world problem. There are international rules and protocols and norms and ethics. And when it comes to using chemical weapons, the entire world should be concerned.Now, in terms of what that means in terms of American action, keep in mind, we're already taking a whole range of actions. We're going to continue to take a whole range of actions. Separate and apart from the chemical weapon use, we got tens of thousands of people who are being killed inside of , and we want to see that stopped for humanitarian reasons, but also for strategic reasons.But in terms of any additional steps that we take, it's going to be based on, number one, the facts on the ground. Number two, it's going to be based on what's in the interest of the American people and our national security. And as President of the United States, I'm going to make those decisions based on the best evidence and after careful consultation, because when we rush into things, when we leap before we look, then not only do we pay a price, but oftentimes, we see unintended consequences on the ground.

I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything—for example, with the—to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal—people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us—sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?People leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with—although I don't have much Republican support anymore—is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system? And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.I also believe—I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and—not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.So, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united—not united—a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our—under the last administration—the Obama-Biden administration.But so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have—when I call for a Summit of the Democracies—I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy—what is it that's going to allow us to generate—we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.We used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about America's backyard. It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that—of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.But the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.Yes.

Now, I have great faith in our intelligence community, the best in the world, but President Putin was extremely firm in his denial. Very, very strong. He even made an offer to cooperate, which is something you don't see every day. And frankly, nobody talks about Hillary's emails. Where are they? It's a disgrace.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Q. First, if you receive a mandatory E-Verify bill only without legalization, are you planning to veto that deal?And second, on Fast and Furious, Members of Congress and the Government of Mexico are still waiting for answers. Are you planning to replace ATF leadership? And when can we expect the results of the current investigation? [SEP] On the second question, as you know, my Attorney General has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. The investigation is still pending. I'm not going to comment on a current investigation. I've made very clear my views that that would not be an appropriate step by the ATF, and we got to find out how that happened. As soon as the investigation is completed, I think appropriate actions will be taken.With respect to E-Verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I've said it before. I will say it again. I will say it next week, and I'll say it 6 months from now. We've got to have a system that makes sure that we uphold our tradition as a nation of laws and that we also uphold our tradition as a nation of immigrants. And that means tough border security, going after employers that are illegally hiring and exploiting workers, making sure that we also have a pathway for legal status for those who are living in the shadows right now.We may not be able to get everything that I would like to see in a package, but we have to have a balanced package. E-Verify can be an important enforcement tool if it's not riddled with errors, if U.S. citizens are protected, because what I don't want is a situation in which employers are forced to set up a system that they can't be certain works. And we don't want to expose employers to the risk where they end up rejecting a qualified candidate for a job because the list says that that person is an illegal immigrant, and it turns out that the person isn't an illegal immigrant. That wouldn't be fair for the employee and would probably get the employer in trouble as well.So I think the goal right now is to let's continue to see if we can perfect the E-Verify system. Let's make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of scenarios that I talked about. But let's also not lose sight of some of the other components to immigration reform. For example, making sure that DREAM Act kids--kids who have grown up here in the United States, think of themselves as Americans, who are not legal through no fault of their own, and who are ready to invest and give back to our country and go to school and fight in our military and start businesses here--let's make sure that those kids can stay. We need to have a more balanced approach than just a verification system. Okay?", "label": "Deflection"}

Furthermore, what are your thoughts on President Calderon's proposed reforms? And finally, considering recent events in Ecuador, what are the security implications for NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia? [SEP] Look, folks, we're not in a recession, we're just seeing a bit of a slowdown. We had growth last year, and we're working to keep things moving forward. Of course, people are concerned, and I understand that. That's why we passed a strong economic package with Congress, sending rebates to folks in May and giving businesses incentives to invest. Experts say it'll help, and I believe it will. The key is for Congress not to raise taxes and mess things up. Calderon's a good man, he'll do what's right for Mexico. And Uribe? He's our best friend in South America. He's fighting the good fight against the bad guys. We need to support him, and that means passing the free trade agreement with Colombia. Turning our back on him would be a big mistake. Mexico's taking steps to deal with the slowdown here, and they're investing heavily in infrastructure. They're also giving tax breaks to businesses that invest in poorer areas. They're doing what they can to keep their economy strong. Canada's economy is stable, and we're working to keep it that way. We have a free trade agreement with Colombia, and the US and Mexico should too. I said it before, you can have drug trafficking with or without a free trade agreement.

You also mentioned that you want targeted tax and regulatory relief for small businesses in the coming year. Can you describe those ideas a little more? And also, can we really afford new tax breaks at this point, given the cost of the war on terrorism? [SEP] John, the first question all of us here in Washington ask is, how do we make sure this economy continues to grow? A vibrant economy is going to be necessary to fund not only war but a lot of other aspects of our Government. We have shown over the past 6 years that low taxes have helped this economy recover from some pretty significant shocks. After all, the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent and 7 million more Americans have been— have found jobs since August of 2003. And we cut the deficit in half a couple of years in advance of what we thought would happen.The question that Congress is going to have to face, and I'm going to have to continue to face is, how do we make sure we put policy in place to encourage economic growth in the short term, and how do we keep America competitive in the long term?Part of the competitive initiative, which I have been working with Congress on, recognizes that education of young—of the young is going to be crucial for remaining competitive. And that's why the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind is going to be an important part of the legislative agenda going forward in 2007.I also spoke about energy in my opening remarks. In my judgment, we're going to have to get off oil as much as possible to remain a competitive economy, and I'm looking forward to working with Congress to do just that. I'm optimistic about some of the reports I've heard about new battery technologies that will be coming to the market that will enable people who—people to drive the first 20 miles, for example, on electricity—that will be the initial phase—and then up to 40 miles on battery technologies. That will be positive, particularly if you live in a big city. A lot of people don't drive more than 20 miles or 40 miles a day. And therefore, those urban dwellers who aren't driving that much won't be using any gasoline on a daily basis, and that will be helpful to the country.I'm pleased with the fact that we've gone from about a billion gallons of ethanol to over 5 billion gallons of ethanol in a very quick period of time. It's mainly derived from corn here in the United States. But there's been great progress, and we need to continue to spend money on cellulosic ethanol. That means that new technologies that—will enable us to use wood chips, for example, or switchgrass as the fuel stocks for the development of new types of fuels that will enable American drivers to diversify away from gasoline.I spent a lot of time talking about nuclear power, and I appreciate the Congress's support on the comprehensive energy bill that I signed. But nuclear power is going to be an essential source, in my judgment, of future electricity for the United States and places like China and India. Nuclear power is renewable, and nuclear power does not emit one greenhouse gas. And it makes a lot of sense for us to share technologies that will enable people to feel confident that the nuclear powerplants that are being built are safe, as well as technologies that will eventually come to fore that will enable us to reduce the wastes, the toxicity of the waste, and the amount of the waste.I'm going to continue to invest in clean coal technologies. We've got an abundance of coal here in America, and we need to be able to tell the American people we're going to be able to use that coal to generate electricity in environmentally friendly ways.My only point to you is we've got a comprehensive plan to achieve the objective that most Americans support, which is less dependency upon oil.I think it's going to be very important, John, to keep this economy growing—short term and long term—by promoting free trade. It's in our interest that nations treat our markets, our goods and services the way we treat theirs. And it's in our interest that administrations continue to promote more opening up markets. We've had a lot of discussions here in this administration on the Doha round of WTO negotiations. And I'm very strongly in favor of seeing if we can't reach an accord with our trading partners and other countries around the world to promote—to get this round completed so that free trade is universal in its application.Free trade is going to be good for producers of U.S. product and services, but free trade is also going to be the most powerful engine for development around the world. It's going to help poor nations become wealthier nations. It's going to enable countries to be able to find markets for their goods and services so that they can better grow their economies and create prosperity for their people.So we've got a robust agenda moving forward with the Congress, and I'm looking forward to working with them. And there are a lot of places where we can find common ground on these important issues.Elaine [Elaine Quijano, Cable News Network].", "label": "Dodging"}
{"sentence": "Q. Many analysts and some former members of your administration believe that the kind of negotiated political settlement that you say is necessary in Syria will require working directly with Iran and giving Iran an important role. Do you agree? And is that a dialogue you'll be actively seeking?And what about the fight against ISIS? What would it take for there to be explicit cooperation between the U.S. and Iran? [SEP] I do agree that we're not going to solve the problems in Syria unless there's buy-in from the Russians, the Iranians, the Turks, our Gulf partners. It's too chaotic. There are too many factions. There's too much money and too many arms flooding into the zone. It's gotten caught up in both sectarian conflict and geopolitical jockeying. And in order for us to resolve it, there's going to have to be agreement among the major powers that are interested in Syria that this is not going to be won on the battlefield. So Iran is one of those players, and I think that it's important for them to be part of that conversation.I want to repeat what I said earlier. We have not—and I don't anticipate any time in the near future—restored normal diplomatic relations with Iran. And so I do not foresee a formal set of agreements with Iran in terms of how we're conducting our counter-ISIL campaign.But clearly, Iran has influence in Iraq. Iraq has a majority Shia population. They have relationships to Iran. Some are natural. We expect somebody like Prime Minister Abadi to meet with and negotiate and work with Iran as its neighbor. Some are less legitimate, where you see Iran financing Shia militias that, in the past, have killed American soldiers and, in the future, may carry out atrocities when they move into Sunni areas.And so we're working with our diplomats on the ground, as well as our military teams on the ground to asses where can we appropriately at least deconflict and where can we work with Prime Minister Abadi around an overall strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty and where do we tell Abadi, you know what, what Iran is doing there is a problem, and we can't cooperate in that area, for example, unless you get those folks out of there because we're not going to have our troops, even in an advisory or training role, looking over their shoulders because they're not sure what might happen to them. And those conversations have been ongoing. I think they will continue.The one thing you can count on is that any work that the U.S. Government does or the U.S. military does in Iraq with other partners on the ground is premised on the idea that they are reporting to—under the chain of command of the Iraqi Government and Iraqi security forces. If we don't have confidence that ultimately Abadi is directing those soldiers, then it's tough for us to have any kind of direct relationship. Okay?Major Garrett [CBS News].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. And, Prime Minister Brown, what concrete measures can Western governments take to address the soaring food prices? And do you think that there should be a rethinking of biofuel policy? [SEP] Let me start on Iran here. If they learn how to enrich, it is knowledge which can be used to develop a nuclear weapon. They claimed that they've got a civilian program in place, that this is only for civilian purposes. If that's the case, why did they have a secret program? Why have they violated the IAEA? And so our objective is to, on the one hand, recognize they have a sovereign right to have civilian power by joining Russia and providing them with the fuel necessary to run their civilian nuclear facility, and then having them honor the agreements they've signed up to.They have proven themselves to be untrustworthy. And you know, to say that, well, okay, it's okay to let them learn to enrich, and assume that that program and knowledge couldn't be transferred to a program, a military program, is, in my judgment, naive. And that is why the United States, in working with Britain and France and Germany and the United Nations Security Council, is all aiming to say to the Iranians: Verifiably suspend your program, and there's a better way forward for you.And so it's—our diplomatic efforts are ongoing, and I appreciate the fact that Great Britain has been a great country to work with on this issue, because Gordon Brown seriously sees the threat, as do I. And now is the time to confront the threat. And I believe we can solve the problem diplomatically, and that is why we're working to verifiably suspend their enrichment. Well, I make no apology for saying that we will extend sanctions, where possible, on Iran. Iran is in breach of the nonproliferation treaty. Iran has not told the truth to the international community about what its plans are. And that's why I'm talking to other European leaders about how we can extend European sanctions against Iran over the next period of time and to ensure that what sanctions are taken are effectively implemented and to monitor the effect on the Iranian regime where we see high inflation in Iran that is not properly disclosed by the regime and the effect that sanctions are actually beginning to have on that country.So in the next few weeks, we want to extend the measures and sanctions to include investment in liquefied natural gas. I believe that sends another signal to the regime that what is happening is unacceptable. I'm pleased Secretary of State Rice is here with us today, because we will support her in the efforts that are being made, working with our other partners, including of course Russia and China, on this to make sure that Iran recognizes that it cannot ignore the international community and its obligations at its—without—with impunity.You also asked about food prices. I'm calling a meeting in London in the next few days with the head of the World Food Programme to discuss what we can do to deal with the situation that is producing food riots in many countries, the lowest supplies of food for 30 years, shortages of food in many continents and many countries that are making people worried about whether, in some countries, they can actually feed the people.Now, there are long and detailed causes for why this is happening. In Asia, people's demand for better and higher quality of food means that more agricultural production is needed. Subsidies in some areas have meant that there is less agricultural production in Africa than there should be. The World Food Programme is wanting and has issued an appeal for more support. And we and America have already offered more support to help feed people who are in the greatest of difficulty.And in the long term, yes, we will look at biofuels, where we've withdrawn some of the subsidies for biofuels. We've got to get it absolutely right, but we're dealing with the environmental issue as well as dealing with the problem of increased production of food. And of course, we've got to increase, generally, our ability to produce more food for more of the world's people over the next few years.So yes, we must act immediately, and yes, we must have a long-term plan.

President Obama, you have emphasized and highlighted the economic management of Chile, the leadership in the region--those were your words--and even the successful transitioning to democracy in the difficult years of the nineties. However, in Chile, President Obama, there are some open wounds of the dictatorship of General Pinochet. And so in that sense, leaders, political leaders, leaders of the world, of human rights, even MPs, the son of the murdered Orlando Letelier, Foreign Minister, have said that many of those wounds have to do with the United States.

Also, we haven't built a new refinery in decades, which makes no sense. Permitting is incredibly difficult, discouraging investment. We import a lot of refined product. We can also promote trade.

The Bush Center at SMU could remind people about the benefits of free trade: for our workers, overseas workers, development, and lifting people out of poverty in third world countries. Trade is the best way to enhance economic growth and give people a better future. I hope the country doesn't become protectionist. April, yes?", "label": "General"}

Do you need to be more realistic and scale down these priorities in order to get something passed? [SEP] No, I don't think so. When you say more realistic, I think it's extremely realistic to say to people, because—let me back up. You all really know the politics in this country, and your networks and others. You've spent a lot of time, which I'm glad you do, polling this data, determining where the—what the American people's attitudes are, et cetera. The American people overwhelmingly agree with me on prescription drugs. They overwhelmingly agree with me on the cost of education. They overwhelmingly agree with me on early education. They overwhelmingly—and go on the list—on childcare.And so we just have to make the case what we're for and what the other team is not for. Look, we knew all along that a lot of this was going to be an uphill fight. And one of the ways to do this is to make sure we make the contrast as clear as we can.And one of the things that I think is—we're going to have to do is just make the case.

In your opinion, President Bush, what kind of alliance do you have with the Republic of Korea? And during your summit meeting today, I believe you agreed to upgrade the Korea-U.S. alliance. In order to upgrade the alliance, what kind of new movement will you take on, for instance, the transfer of wartime operational control? And what will you do, President Bush—do you have any intention to meet with both President Lee and Chairman Kim in order to resolve this issue? [SEP] No—[inaudible]—described the relationship—[inaudible]—a 21st-century strategic alliance. That makes sense to me. So what does that mean? Well, it means we work in ways to deal with 21st-century problems, such as proliferation of nuclear materials, such as working to make sure our children are educated with the tools necessary to be productive citizens, such as having a recognition that in the 21st century, a free and fair trading system will be necessary for prosperity. And that's why it's going to be very important for our Congress to ratify the free trade agreement with Korea.It's going to be very important a 21stcentury alliance recognizes that China is a opportunity for both nations to engage in a constructive way. Well, we have our problems with China, of course, whether it be human rights or how the Chinese leadership deals with the Dalai Lama or with Burma, a variety of issues. On the other hand, you can either have a constructive relationship—we can work constructively with China—or we can have a destructive relationship. I've chosen to have a constructive relationship.And so the step one is to anticipate the issues confronting our peoples in the 21st century, and step two is to develop a practical way to deal with those issues. And that's exactly what our conversation revolved around. And I'm confident that this meeting has strengthened our relationship, and I'm confident that the American people understand how important this relationship is to our own prosperity and our own security.And so it's been a really good visit, and we're glad you came here too.

And can the possibility of military action or a retaliatory cyberattack be definitively ruled out? [SEP] Let me reiterate: the matter with North Korea is under close review. A range of options are being formulated, and I will decide on a course of action that is, in my judgment, commensurate with the gravity of the offense. As for Cuba, a summit is premature.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, on the matter of E-Verify, if a bill reaches your desk mandating its use but lacking provisions for legalization, will you veto it? Furthermore, concerning the 'Fast and Furious' operation, both Congress and the Mexican government are still awaiting answers. Do you intend to replace the leadership at the ATF, and when can we anticipate the release of the investigation's findings? [SEP] Regarding 'Fast and Furious,' my Attorney General has stated clearly that he would never have authorized the transfer of guns into Mexico. The investigation is ongoing, and I won't be commenting on an active investigation. My position is clear: that would be an unacceptable action by the ATF, and we must determine how it occurred. Once the investigation concludes, appropriate measures will be taken. As for E-Verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I've stated this before, and I will reiterate it. We require a system that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws while also honoring our heritage as a nation of immigrants. This entails robust border security, holding employers accountable for illegal hiring practices, and providing a pathway to legal status for those currently living in the shadows. While we may not achieve everything I desire in a single package, we must strive for a balanced approach. E-Verify can serve as a valuable enforcement tool if it is accurate and safeguards the rights of U.S. citizens. We must avoid a situation where employers are compelled to implement a system that is unreliable and potentially exposes them to the risk of rejecting qualified candidates due to erroneous information. Therefore, our immediate goal is to continue refining the E-Verify system and implementing safeguards to prevent the scenarios I've described. However, we must also remain focused on the other essential components of immigration reform. For instance, ensuring that DREAM Act recipients—young individuals who have grown up in the United States, consider themselves Americans, are not undocumented through any fault of their own, and are eager to contribute to our country through education, military service, or entrepreneurship—are allowed to remain. We need a more holistic approach than simply a verification system. Understood?", "label": "Declining to answer"}

[SEP] I was briefed by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI on this subject last week. We spent a lot of time talking about the IG report. First of all, I want to compliment the IG for good and necessary work. They brought the findings of this good work to my attention. My question is, what are you going to do to solve the problem, and how fast can you get it solved?And I was pleased by Director Mueller's answer, that he had already begun to address some of the problems, but there's more work to be done.

The international community is strongly urging to withdraw its launch announcement. If proceeds, it must accept all responsibility. As mentioned, it will only worsen its isolation, and must face the consequences. The people of will see their leader spending vast sums on a missile launch.

{"sentence": "Given your past assertion that the Taliban posed no threat to the Afghan people, who do you now believe is supporting their acts of kidnapping and attacking government officials, and what are their underlying motives?

The Taliban pose dangers to our innocent people, including children attending school, our clergy, teachers, engineers, and international aid workers. However, they do not pose a threat to the Government of Afghanistan, its institutions, or the development of those institutions. They are a defeated and frustrated force resorting to cowardly acts such as killing schoolchildren. The question of who is supporting them is one we have been actively investigating for some time. I hope the jirga between us and Pakistan will offer some solutions to this issue. One thing is clear: we know their vision of governance. They have held power and demonstrated their beliefs and actions to the world. It would be beneficial to speak with a mother of a young girl about her experiences under Taliban rule. These individuals are brutal and cold-blooded killers. That is their nature. The fundamental question for those of us who believe in freedom is whether we confront them and whether the effort to promote an alternative to their hateful ideology is worthwhile. We have determined that it is. That is why President Karzai is here at Camp David, discussing shared concerns and opportunities to defeat this vision of darkness. They simply do not believe in freedom and do not believe in a society where individuals can freely express themselves. This is an ongoing challenge for the free world.

Recent water issues also highlight the critical need for essential materials in both daily life and industrial production. Ensuring a stable supply chain is crucial for our people and national economy, linking to national and military security. While the WTO once fostered free trade, the pandemic and market blocs have introduced supply chain risks. The U.S. and Korea, sharing democratic values and human rights, must collaborate with like-minded nations to stabilize the supply chain. Our National Security Councils are empowered to address this.

{"sentence": "Q. But you acknowledge sanctions basically have not changed the behavior? [SEP] Well, Jonathan, I think that's self-apparent. I think that there are no guarantees in life generally and certainly no guarantees in foreign policy.One of the things that I think has been interesting during this entire discussion—and we've seen this on a lot of foreign policy issues over the last several years—we seem to have gotten in the habit of thinking that when there are hard foreign policy problems, that there may actually be a definitive answer. Typically, those who offer that definitive answer come up with the use of force as the definitive answer. You would think, given that we've just gone through a decade of war, that that assumption would be subject to some questioning. Certainly, in my position as President of the United States and as a student of history, very rarely have I seen the exercise of military power providing a definitive answer either.So you've got some tools in the toolbox; you try to figure out which ones have the best chance of working. Sometimes, it's going to take time to see whether or not a particular approach worked or not. You may not know until after the fact. But what I do know is, is that sanctions have consequences on Russia and that if Mr. Putin were primarily interested in making sure that Russia is a strong, thriving nation for years to come, then he's a lot better off abiding by the agreement that we came up with in Geneva; resolving the situation in Ukraine peacefully; allowing Ukrainians to make their own decisions about their lives so that they can have good relations both with Russia and with Europe; and businesses can continue to have confidence that if they invest in Russia or have economic relations with Russia; or Europeans can have confidence with respect to energy that they purchase from Russia, that it's not going to be suddenly disrupted because of some Russian territorial ambitions that violate international law. Good? [I]—can't remember what the other question was. [] Yes, that was a long statement, I must say. So going back to the question posed to me, when North Korea—nuclear test is actually carried out by North Korea, what will the Korean Government do? That is the question, if I remember it correctly. Now, if North Korea is actually going to carry out the fourth nuclear test, that is going to change—fundamentally change—the Northeast Asian security landscape, and I believe that all our efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through six-party talks is going to be completely dissolved. It's going to go in the air.We tried to resolve the problem through dialogue, but what North Korea did was to buy time to upgrade its nuclear capability. And now with this upgraded nuclear capability, North Korea is not willing to listen to anyone. If this is going to be the situation, there's no actual meaning in us carrying out six-party talks. And to the neighboring countries, there may be an arms—nuclear arms race triggering. So there's actually no stopping—for other neighboring countries, North Korea is not stopped. And South and North Korea has tried to improve relationship, but I think we're going to lose the momentum for the South Korean efforts to improve that relationship if the North Korean nuclear test is going to take place.And also, there is a close linkage between North Korean nuclear program and others, so I believe that North Korea's nuclear capability is going to bring a serious threat to world peace too. And against the backdrop of such analysis, I believe this is not going to be a problem only for the Northeast Asian region, this is going to be a serious threat to the global peace. And if such an event is going to be realized, the U.N., in order to uphold the peace, will have to impose very strong sanctions.That is my view. And I also believe that there is a strong role to be played by China. I'd like to emphasize the role of China. China, with regards to possession of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, of their testing, North Korea has strongly opposed to the idea, and it has also maintained a very strong position for the U.N. sanctions. So if against a very bad situation, if China is going to maintain a very strong position, take very strong measures to make sure that North Korea—China will not tolerate the situation, then it's going to be very important. The trade relations, about 90 percent of trade relations and about 80 percent of economic support is going from China to North Korea, and therefore, China's influence in North Korea is indeed huge.And against this very dangerous situation, I really look forward to China's leading role in making sure that the threat is not going to be translated into action.

He represents a government formed by the people of Iraq. It's a—and he's got a tough job. I mean, think about what his job is like. He's got to deal with political factions. He's got to deal with the hatred that is left over from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.There's a lot of people still furious about what happened to them during Saddam Hussein's period. You can imagine that. What happens if your brother or sister had been assassinated by Saddam Hussein and his political party? You'd be—you wouldn't be happy about it. Reconciliation is difficult in a society that had been divided and tortured by a tyrant.And Prime Minister Maliki has got the difficult job of reconciling these grievances and different political parties on top of that, plus dealing with violence. I've talked to him a lot. I like his spirit. I like his attitude. He's confident we can achieve the mission. He's not—he's realistic about how difficult it is in Iraq.It's in our Government's interest that we help him succeed, because he wants a unified country. And I believe we will succeed. I know we're not going to succeed, however, if we set artificial timetables for withdrawal or we get out of there or we say to the enemy, Just keep fighting; we'll leave soon. That's not going to work. What will work is a strategy that's constantly— tactics that constantly change to meet the enemy. And that's what I was describing in my speech; we're constantly adjusting. As the enemy changes, we change. War is not a—this war and other wars, they're not static. They're dynamic events. And we must adjust to meet those events, and we are.Jim [Jim Rutenberg, New York Times].", "label": "Explicit"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, with all due respect, critics point to a lack of progress on key domestic issues this year, coupled with historically low approval ratings. Looking back, would you characterize this as the most challenging year of your presidency? [SEP] Well, Julie, let me put it this way: I don't dwell on the past in that manner. Been in office almost five years, campaigned for two before that, and as you all know, there have been highs and lows. This room has probably seen its fair share of 'end of the world' scenarios. My focus, day in and day out, is whether we're making life better for the American people – giving families more opportunities, a sense of security that hard work pays off. Sure, there have been frustrations this past year, areas where Congress should have acted faster. But even when Congress stalls, we're still pushing forward. Take the ConnectEd program – wireless in every classroom – that's a game-changer for kids and teachers. Or the manufacturing hub in Youngstown, connecting innovation, universities, and job training. And when it comes to energy, we're now producing more oil and natural gas than we import – a significant achievement.", "label": "Deflection"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, with regard to the Hadley memo situation, did you personally authorize or instruct your staff to commence an investigation into the leak prior to your meeting with Prime Minister al-Maliki? Furthermore, if the leak was indeed unauthorized, do you entertain any suspicions that elements within your administration might be deliberately attempting to undermine your Iraq policy or sabotage your scheduled meeting with the Prime Minister? [SEP] I'm attempting to recollect whether I specifically ordered an investigation. I don't have a distinct memory of doing so. However, I do distinctly remember expressing considerable concern regarding the persistent leaks. The press, naturally, is dedicated to uncovering information and disseminating it, which I fully understand. However, the unauthorized release of classified documents is simply unacceptable. This is a recurring challenge, not exclusive to this administration, but one that any administration must confront when endeavoring to implement policy. We've encountered numerous leaks, some originating from sources I cannot even ascertain, and therefore, I will refrain from speculation. Identifying the source of these leaks is often an exercise in futility, which provides you with a distinct advantage in your profession. While we can express our displeasure, it's exceedingly difficult to pinpoint those within the government who are willing to divulge sensitive documents, such as Hadley's memo. There may well be an ongoing investigation; I'm simply not privy to that information at this juncture. If there is, and I was informed, it's not currently at the forefront of my thoughts. However, I firmly believe that it's imperative to identify and hold accountable those within our government who engage in the leaking of classified information, which is a clear violation of the law. Perhaps the most effective means of preventing future leaks is to ensure that there are tangible consequences for those who engage in such behavior.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, concerning a potential meeting with President Putin during your trip, is such an encounter likely, or have you ruled it out entirely? [SEP] I anticipate an encounter, given his presence. It is imperative to acknowledge Russia's pivotal role in World War II, a central theme of the Normandy commemorations. However, the geopolitical landscape east of NATO's borders has undergone a transformation. We are confronted with aggression, specifically armed aggression, directed against a neighboring state. The precedent was set in Georgia; now, Ukraine, with particular emphasis on Crimea, is the focal point. President Putin has not concealed the involvement of Russian armed forces. This reality must be acknowledged, just as Russia has not obscured the doubling of its defense budget over the past four years. A fundamental question arises: why? What is the intended objective? What implications does this hold for NATO member states? Our collective aspiration is for a modernized Russia, fostering mutually beneficial commerce, amicable neighborly relations, and multifaceted cooperation. However, our immediate imperative is to address the current situation by upholding Ukraine's sovereignty and its prerogative to pursue a pro-Western trajectory. Furthermore, we must bolster Ukraine's modernization efforts. I firmly believe that this course of action serves as a compelling model for Russian society, mirroring the positive influence of Poland's democratic evolution, free market principles, prosperity, and security. This exerted a beneficial influence on Ukraine, inspiring them to emulate the same values. I am also convinced that a prosperous, democratic, and independent Ukraine, effectively surmounting its economic and political challenges, will exert a profound influence on the attitudes of the Russian populace. It is readily apparent that Russian public sentiment has largely endorsed President Putin's assertive conduct in Crimea. However, Russian public opinion should prioritize Russia's modernization, rather than the re-establishment of spheres of influence or the pursuit of imperial ambitions. This concludes the press conference. Thank you for your attention.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, were there any positive outcomes from President Carter's discussions with Hamas? Did your administration advise him against engaging with them? And will these discussions impact your upcoming trip to the Middle East? [SEP] I haven't spoken with President Carter, and therefore I lack specific knowledge regarding the substance of his discussions. I remain skeptical of Hamas's willingness to change. Ultimately, the onus is on them to demonstrate a genuine commitment to peace. Too often, such meetings yield only superficial results. We have witnessed Hamas's destabilizing influence for far too long. I supported the elections in which they gained power, based on promises of anti-corruption. However, they have failed to deliver tangible improvements for the people of Gaza. During my upcoming trip, my objective is to collaborate with both the Israelis and President Abbas to identify common ground and empower Palestinians in the West Bank. We are exploring several promising initiatives. I remain hopeful that we can achieve a lasting agreement before the end of my presidency. Secretary Rice is returning to the region. I have been in communication with both President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert. The prevailing sentiment is positive, and there is a shared understanding of the importance of establishing a defined state.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, like that cease-fire, you've called for diplomatic solutions not only in Israel and Gaza, but also in Ukraine, in Iraq, to very little effect so far. Has the United States of America lost its influence in the world? Have you lost yours? [SEP] Yes. Look, this is a common theme that folks bring up. Apparently, people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world. And so our diplomatic efforts often take time. They often will see progress and then a step backwards. That's been true in the Middle East. That's been true in Europe. That's been true in Asia. That's the nature of world affairs. It's not neat, and it's not smooth.But if you look at, for example, Ukraine, we have made progress in delivering on what we said we would do. We can't control how Mr. Putin thinks. But what we can do is say to Mr. Putin, if you continue on the path of arming separatists with heavy armaments that, the evidence suggests, may have resulted in 300 innocent people on a jet dying, and that violates international law and undermines the integrity—territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, then you're going to face consequences that will hurt your country.And there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to coordinate with Europeans for a strong series of sanctions. And each time, we have done what we said we would do, including this week, when we put in place sanctions that have an impact on key sectors of the Russian economy: their energy, their defense, and their financial systems.It hasn't resolved the problem yet. I spoke to Mr. Putin this morning, and I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we'll also do what we say we do in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position. If he respects and honors the right of Ukrainians to determine their own destiny, then it's possible to make sure that Russian interests are addressed that are legitimate and that Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions and we can resolve this conflict and end some of the bloodshed.But the point is, though, Bill, that if you look at the 20th century and the early part of this century, there are a lot of conflicts that America doesn't resolve. That's always been true. That doesn't mean we stop trying. And it's not a measure of American influence on any given day or at any given moment that there are conflicts around the world that are difficult. The conflict in Northern Ireland raged for a very, very long time until finally something broke, where the parties decided that it wasn't worth killing each other.The Palestinian-Israeli conflicts has been going on even longer than you've been reporting. [] And I don't think at any point was there a suggestion somehow that America didn't have influence just because we weren't able to finalize an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. You will recall that situations like Kosovo and Bosnia raged on for quite some time, and there was a lot more death and bloodshed than there has been so far in the Ukrainian situation before it ultimately did get resolved.And so I recognize, with so many different issues popping up around the world, sometimes, it may seem as if this is an aberration or it's unusual. But the truth of the matter is, is that this is a big world out there and that as indispensable as we are to try to lead it, there's still going to be tragedies out there and there are going to be conflicts. And our job is to just make sure that we continue to project what's right, what's just, and that we're building coalitions of like-minded countries and partners in order to advance not only our core security interests, but also the interests of the world as a whole.", "label": "Implicit"}

Iraq is relatively calm; North Korea, no longer on the terrorist threat list. How would you define, if, in fact, there is still an axis of evil? And what is the greatest and most urgent threat when it comes to security that Barack Obama has to deal with? [SEP] The most urgent threat that he'll have to deal with, and other Presidents after him will have to deal with, is an attack on our homeland. You know, I wish I could report that's not the case, but there's still an enemy out there that would like to inflict damage on America, Americans. And that will be the major threat.North Korea is still a problem. There is a debate in the intel community about how big a problem they are. But one of my concerns is that there might be a highly enriched uranium program. And therefore, it is really important that out of the six-party talks comes a strong verification regime. In other words, in order to advance our relations with North Korea, the North Korean Government must honor the commitments it made to allow for strong verification measures to be in place, to ensure that they don't develop a highly enriched uranium program, for example.So they're still dangerous, and Iran is still dangerous.Yes.", "label": "Explicit"}

At the same time, the wealthiest Americans are hoarding a share of the nation's wealth not seen since the Jazz Age. These aren't Democratic talking points; they're cold, hard facts. Historically, America's strength has always been a vibrant, thriving middle class where anyone can achieve the American Dream. That's what we should be striving for: creating opportunities for all. We should celebrate success stories like Steve Jobs and his revolutionary products. We want people to get rich; that's part of the free market. But those of us who've been blessed with extraordinary success have a responsibility to give back to the community, ensuring that future generations have the same opportunities. That means investing in schools that work, infrastructure that functions, and colleges that are open to everyone with talent and a willingness to work hard.

{"sentence": "Q. Gas prices are now approaching $5 a gallon in some parts of the country. Offshore oil exploration is obviously a long-term approach. What is the short-term advice for Americans? What can you do now to help them? [SEP] First of all, there is a psychology in the oil market that basically says, supplies are going to stay stagnant while demand rises. And that's reflected, somewhat, in the price of crude oil. Gasoline prices are reflected—the amount of a gasoline price at the pump is reflected in the price of crude oil. And therefore, it seems like it makes sense to me to say to the world that we're going to use new technologies to explore for oil and gas in the United States—offshore oil, ANWR, oil shale projects—to help change this psychology, to send a clear message that the supplies of oil will increase.Secondly, obviously, good conservation measures matter. I've been reading a lot about how the automobile companies are beginning to adjust—people, consumers are beginning to say, Wait a minute, I don't want a gas guzzler anymore; I want a smaller car. So the two need to go hand in hand. There is no immediate fix. This took us a while to get in this problem; there is no short-term solution. I think it was in the Rose Garden where I issued this brilliant statement: If I had a magic wand. But the President doesn't have a magic wand. You just can't say, low gas.

They include the armed forces, the federal police service, and all of the state-level police bodies in the State of Rio de Janeiro.We already have experience in the public security arena because last year we organized and staged the World Soccer Cup, and we did—had to provide security not only to just one city—rather, we had to cover the whole country. And there was not one single action that was left uncontrolled in the 12 different host cities of the World Cup in Brazil, thereby establishing a very effective control system by means of command-and-control centers, as well as monitoring control centers, covering all activities including the displacement of athletes as well as high-ranking government officials and authorities.So we followed up on and ensured proper security conditions to all of those steps.

Once they've demonstrably halted enrichment, we'll engage with our EU-3 partners and Russia to discuss a path forward. It's plain as day for the Iranians. Their Foreign Minister suggested talks after we leave Iraq. If they genuinely seek dialogue for the betterment of their people, they should verifiably suspend their program. It's that simple. The Iranian people deserve better than isolation. They boast a rich history and tradition, yet their leader consistently projects an image of Iran at odds with global norms, willing to isolate the nation to the detriment of its citizens. The Holocaust conference, for instance, showcased a profoundly backward view of history, signaling the Iranian leader's willingness to harm his country's reputation and further isolate its people. We're actively pursuing a Security Council resolution, as I discussed with Secretary Rice this morning, to underscore Iran's growing isolation. My message to the Iranian people is this: you deserve a leader who doesn't rewrite history, who strengthens your economy, and who refrains from pursuing a nuclear weapon that the world opposes. There's a brighter future for you. As for Syria, the message is consistent. We've engaged with Syria since my presidency began, outlining the necessary steps for improved relations with the United States. These aren't unreasonable demands.

I think it's a good thing for the President to do, to recognize those who the Congress has honored. And I'm looking forward to going.I told the Chinese President, President Hu, that I was going to go to the ceremony. In other words, I brought it up. And I said, I'm going because I want to honor this man. I have consistently told the Chinese that religious freedom is in their nation's interest. I've also told them that I think it's in their interest to meet with the Dalai Lama and will say so at the ceremony today in Congress. If they were to sit down with the Dalai Lama, they would find him to be a man of peace and reconciliation. And I think it's in the country's interest to allow him to come to China and meet with him.So my visit today is not new to the Chinese leadership. As I told you, I brought it up with him. I wanted to make sure he understood exactly why I was going. And they didn't like it, of course, but I don't think it's going to damage—severely damage relations.

We couldn't keep going the way we were, borrowing and consuming without producing. That's why we talked about rebalancing the world economy. We need to save more, cut debt, improve our education and infrastructure. China needs to play fair, too. We're making progress on government procurement and intellectual property. The currency issue is part of it. They've intervened heavily. President Hu says he wants a market-based system, but it's not happening fast enough.

{"sentence": "Q. We hear that you will be talking to President Putin anytime soon. What is your approach?And as the Ukrainian war seems to be at a turning point, do you feel realistic that President Zelenskyy is putting a condition to open negotiations and that is the return of Crimea to Ukraine? [SEP] Look, there is one way for this war to end the rational way: Putin to pull out of Ukraine. Number one. But it appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy price for failing to do it, but he's inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine, bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes. It's sick what he's doing.But the fact of the matter is, I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin is—let me choose my words very carefully—I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war. He hasn't done that yet. If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants—has in mind. He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it's absolutely critical what Emmanuel said: We must support the Ukrainian people. The idea that Putin is ever going to defeat Ukraine is beyond comprehension. Imagine them trying to occupy that country through the next 2, 5, 10, 20 years if they could—if they could.He's miscalculated every single thing he initially calculated. He thought he'd be greeted with open arms by the Russian-speaking portions of the Ukrainian population.Go back and read his speech when he invaded—when I said they were going to invade, and they did when we said they were. Go back and read the speech he made. He talked about him—with needing to be another Peter the Great. He talked about the need for the people—that Kyiv is the motherload of Russian identity in the beginning, et cetera, et cetera. He's just miscalculated across the board.And so the question is, what is his decision—how does he get himself out of the circumstance he's in? I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I'm not going to do it on my own.Thank you.[.] Regarding your question and the preconditions or the conditions set by the Ukrainian President, I believe that what is important for all of us to look at is that as Ukraine is resisting, suffering from war crimes, attacks on their civilian infrastructure, leading counteroffensive, President Zelenskyy presented a 10-point peace plan.So we, I believe, very much need to continue to engage with him, because there is a genuine willingness, on behalf of Ukraine, to discuss these matters. And we acknowledge it, and we commend it.And, for a number of years, I was in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. And the latest—at the last meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, the only one—December 2019—at the time, I was with Chancellor Merkel. And I can tell you that I saw a President who was sincere in his willingness to talk and to negotiate.And since he was elected, until May, President Zelenskyy was very much willing to talk and negotiate. The one who wanted to go to war, to wage war was President Putin. And I could see it by myself, including when I visited Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of February.So it's only legitimate that President Zelenskyy sets some conditions to talk. We need to work on what could lead to a peace agreement, but it is for him to tell us when the time comes and what the choices of the Ukrainians are.So once this has been said, indeed, I will continue to talk to President Putin. And as a matter of fact, we talked about it this morning with President Biden, because we constantly, as well, tried to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results.So I will talk to him about security and safety of nuclear plants in the areas that are being claimed, including Zaporizhzhia, in particular. And over the past few months, we did some work on the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and there is some outstanding work ongoing, which is very important, by Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA.

Mike Hayden, who you mentioned, actually provided a more nuanced assessment than the one you presented. He acknowledged the need for a change in strategy, but he also emphasized the Iraqi government's inability to handle the situation at the time. We've seen significant progress in Anbar Province, where Al Qaeda once sought to establish a safe haven. Sunni sheikhs and citizens are now working with the coalition to bring justice to Al Qaeda killers. This grassroots reconciliation is crucial.

Obviously, the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can. But I think all of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this? Why are we doing this? I mean, we've got a whole bunch of individuals who have been tried who are currently in maximum security prisons around the country. Nothing's happened to them. Justice has been served. It's been done in a way that's consistent with our Constitution, consistent with due process, consistent with rule of law, consistent with our traditions.The individual who attempted to bomb Times Square: in prison, serving a life sentence. The individual who tried to bomb a plane in Detroit: in prison, serving a life sentence. A Somali who was part of Al Shabaab, who we captured: in prison. So we can handle this.And I understand that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the traumas that had taken place, why, for a lot of Americans, the notion was somehow that we had to create a special facility like Guantanamo and we couldn't handle this in a normal, conventional fashion. I understand that reaction. But we're now over a decade out. We should be wiser. We should have more experience in how we prosecute terrorists.And this is a lingering problem that is not going to get better. It's going to get worse. It's going to fester. And so I'm going to, as I said before, examine every option that we have administratively to try to deal with this issue, but ultimately, we're also going to need some help from Congress, and I'm going to ask some folks over there who care about fighting terrorism, but also care about who we are as a people to step up and help me on it.Chuck Todd [NBC News].", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Regarding your successor's recent conversation with the President of Taiwan and his subsequent questioning of the one-China policy, suggesting it could be leveraged for trade or North Korea negotiations, and considering the increased tensions and China's seizure of an underwater drone, do you agree that our China policy needs a fresh perspective? What are your thoughts on a brief call with the President of Taiwan, and do you worry that these unconventional approaches could lead to conflict with our major geopolitical rival? [SEP] Well, that's a great question. I'm somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I think one of the—I've said this before—I am very proud of the work I've done. I think I'm a better President now than when I started. But if you're here for 8 years in the bubble, you start seeing things a certain way, and you benefit from—the democracy benefits, America benefits from some new perspectives. And I think it should be not just the prerogative, but the obligation of a new President, to examine everything that's been done and see what makes sense and what doesn't. That's what I did when I came in, and I'm assuming any new President is going to undertake those same exercises. And given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake in terms of the world economy, national security, our presence in the Asia-Pacific, China's increasing role in international affairs—there's probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and where there's also the potential if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full-conflict mode, that everybody is worse off. So I think it's fine for him to take a look at it. What I've advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you're doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. And since there's only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on what's gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what we've learned from 8 years of experience, so that as he's then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he's got all the information to make good decisions and, by the way, that all of Government is moving at the same time and singing from the same hymnal. And with respect to China—and let's just take the example of Taiwan—there has been a longstanding agreement, essentially, between China, the United States, and to some degree, the Taiwanese, which is to not change the status quo. Taiwan operates differently than mainline—mainland China does. China views Taiwan as part of China, but recognizes that it has to approach Taiwan as an entity that has its own ways of doing things. The Taiwanese have agreed that as long as they're able to continue to function with some degree of autonomy, that they won't charge forward and declare independence. And that status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful and—economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination. But understand, for China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation. And so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what are the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they'll treat some other issues. They won't even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we've had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves. And their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant. That doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past. It does mean that you've got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in. All right. Isaac Dovere of Politico.", "label": "General"}

A disappointment, not a mistake, but a disappointment, was the failure to pass those trade bills on Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. I really thought we had a chance there. Protectionism is a real concern. When times get tough, the temptation is to close borders and protect our own. That sentiment was there even when the economy was doing well. Remember how close CAFTA was? It would be a huge mistake to become a protectionist nation. Maybe the Bush Center at SMU could remind people about the benefits of free and fair trade.

First off, I understand that Congress is going to voice its opinion, and it's pretty obvious where the Democrats, and some Republicans, stand; they didn't agree with my choice. That doesn't mean I think they're bad people, just that they have a different perspective. I took their ideas into account but felt they wouldn't result in a country that could govern itself, support itself, and be an ally in the war on terror. Secondly, I'm hoping this non-binding resolution doesn't turn into a binding policy that stops our troops from doing what I've asked them to do. It's a bit odd to vote for David Petraeus unanimously and then say you won't fund the strategy he thought was necessary, which he testified to in front of the Senate. I'm going to make it very clear to the Members of Congress, starting now, that they need to fund our troops and ensure we have the flexibility needed to get the job done.

Fortunately, she's going to be around quite a bit longer. Her leadership will be critical on economic issues in the euro zone. I compliment her on the courage with which she approaches some of these very difficult political issues. On the international stage, there's no issues that we don't coordinate closely with Germany.

Military missions, participating in military missions are part and parcel of that: on the Balkans, in UNIFIL, in Afghanistan, in combating piracy, and in many other areas. We need to combine military and civil engagement. We share this approach, Barack and I. We live up to our international responsibilities. The world is full of problems that we need to address. You cannot have enough partners that work together with you in a coordinated way, and this is why this cooperation is so extremely important for our common future.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you contemplate the end of this war, can you say as Commander in Chief that the huge human and financial costs that this has entailed can be justified, given the fact that the Afghanistan that the world will leave behind is somewhat diminished from the visions of reconstruction and democracy that were, kind of, prevalent at the beginning of the war?And, President Karzai, many independent studies have criticized Afghanistan for corruption and poor governance. Do you stand by your assertion last month that much of this is due to the influence of foreigners? And are you completely committed to stepping down as President after the elections next year? [SEP] I want us to remember why we went to Afghanistan. We went into Afghanistan because 3,000 Americans were viciously murdered by a terrorist organization that was operating openly and at the invitation of those who were then ruling Afghanistan.It was absolutely the right thing to do for us to go after that organization, to go after the host Government that had aided and abetted—or at least allowed for these attacks to take place. And because of the heroic work of our men and women in uniform, and because of the cooperation and sacrifices of Afghans who had also been brutalized by that then-host Government, we achieved our central goal, which is—or have come very close to achieving our central goal, which is to decapacitate Al Qaida, to dismantle them, to make sure that they can't attack us again.And everything that we've done over the last 10 years, from the perspective of the U.S. national security interest, have been focused on that aim. And I have—at the end of this conflict, we are going to be able to say that the sacrifices that were made by those men and women in uniform has brought about the goal that we sought.Now, what we also recognized very early on was that it was in our national security interest to have a stable, sovereign Afghanistan that was a responsible international actor, that was in partnership with us, and that that required Afghanistan to have its own security capacity and to be on a path that was more likely to achieve prosperity and peace for its own people. And I think would be the first to acknowledge that Afghanistan still has work to do to accomplish those goals, but there's no doubt that the possibility of peace and prosperity in Afghanistan today is higher than before we went in. And that is also in part because of the sacrifices that the American people have made during this long conflict.So I think that—have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios? Probably not. This is a human enterprise, and you fall short of the ideal. Did we achieve our central goal? And have we been able, I think, to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan Government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States? We have achieved that goal. We are in the process of achieving that goal. And for that, I think we have to thank our extraordinary military, intelligence, and diplomatic teams, as well as the cooperation of the Afghan Government and the Afghan people. . Sir, on the question of corruption, whether it has a foreign element to it, if I have correctly understood your question, there is corruption in Afghanistan. There is corruption in the Afghan Government that we are fighting against, employing various means and methods. We have succeeded in certain ways. But if your question is whether we are satisfied, of course not.And on the corruption that is foreign in origin, but occurring in Afghanistan, I have been very clear and explicit, and I don't think that Afghanistan can see less corruption unless there is cooperation between us and our international partners on correcting some of the methods or applications of delivery of assistance to Afghanistan, without cooperation and without recognition of the problems.On elections, for me, the greatest of my achievements, eventually, seen by the Afghan people, will be a proper, well-organized, interference-free election in which the Afghan people can elect their next President.

{"sentence": "Q. Well, I wanted to ask you about SCHIP and why you even let that get to a situation where it had to be a veto.

And I don't know why. But they just ran the bill, and I made it clear we weren't going to accept it. That happens sometimes. In the past, when I said, look, make sure we're a part of the process, and we were. In this case, this bill started heading our way—and I recognize Republicans in the Senate supported it. We made it clear we didn't agree, and they passed it anyway. And so now, hopefully, we'll be in the process. That's why the President has a veto. Sometimes the legislative branch wants to go on without the President, pass pieces of legislation, and the President then can use the veto to make sure he's a part of the process. And that's—as you know, I fully intend to do. I want to make sure—and that's why, when I tell you I'm going to sprint to the finish and finish this job strong, that's one way to ensure that I am relevant; that's one way to sure that I am in the process.

President Calderon, concerning energy matters, 3 days before the celebration of the anniversary of the expropriation of oil in our country, could you tell us what the position of the Senators of opposition have stated about these matters of oil? We know that the reserves and, of course this oil abundance, perhaps, is coming to its end. Was this issue on oil discussed here?And, President Bush, 2008 will welcome the opening up of livestock and agriculture matters. Sir, is there a possibility of renegotiating or, perhaps, leave it for a later date this negotiation of this part of the trade agreement because of the complaints of Mexican producers? [SEP] The truth of the matter is that we did not discuss this issue of oil, because this is something that has to do specifically with Mexicans. This is a Mexican issue. We will not privatize a company that belongs to Mexicans, such as of the case of Pemex. We will have to see this later on, in terms of sovereignty, and speak about the initiatives, of course, and to see what our Congress states. We do have problems with the decline of, especially, Cantarell, which has been very important in the production of oil throughout the years, but which is declining in amounts. But we will have to be very clear on the fact that we will be sharing responsibility between Congress and the President.Concerning agriculture and livestock, I do share the sensitivity of our working group and We have set up a working group to deal with the matters of corn and bean, precisely to make more agile this transition, which is established at the end of the free trade agreement, NAFTA.We do have different problems now today, different from what it was 1 year ago, when we see that the prices of corn are going down. We are having very high costs in our production. This has left our producers out of competition. And now we are seeing what consumption is all about with these very high prices, in the case of corn.However, due to the circumstance we have had in this meeting, we strengthened and we will be strengthening even more a group, a working group, which will address these issues, which are very sensitive for Mexican producers. No, no. Excuse me, Tony. One reason I didn't bring up energy is because energy is—it belongs to sovereign Mexico. And I'm confident that the President will make the best interests for the people of Mexico, working with the Congress.In terms of opening up NAFTA, renegotiating NAFTA is a mistake, in my judgment. NAFTA has worked. And there is a mechanism in place, that the President just described, about how to resolve sensitive issues. There will be sensitive issues on a frequent basis when it comes to trade. And the best way to resolve those is through negotiations and discussions, recognizing the sensitivities on both sides of the border. But trying to renegotiate a treaty that has been incredibly important for both sides of the border, in my judgment, would be a mistake. You don't want to weaken NAFTA; you want to make sure it stays strong in order that prosperity continues to expand and people benefit on both sides of the border.", "label": "Explicit"}

What's your plan, going forward, to prove to Americans that you're the right person for this job? [SEP] I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We're leading in North Carolina. We're leading in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Arizona—our numbers. We're leading in Arizona. We're leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We're leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it's a terrible thing when you look at it.But I had the same thing 4 years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn't going to win any State, and I ended up winning every one of them, you know, the swing States. I wasn't going to win any of them, and I won all of them. And I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer. They have it closer, but it's the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing State and substantially in other States, by even more than I won in '16.When you look at Florida, as an example, you have thousands of boat out on—boats out in the ocean, out in the Intracoastal. You look at other States where, likewise, you have thousands of boats, and they're all waving the Trump sign—Trump-Pence sign—and they're so proud. Thousands and thousands. You've seen it—where you have Bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends.I think there's more spirit now than there's ever been for my campaign, and that includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there's more today, because what we've done, nobody has ever done before. Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes—the most in our history—created the greatest economy we've ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody has ever done, and all of these different things.The VA—we got VA Choice. We got VA everything for the VA. Right now they had a 91-percent approval rating at—in a recent poll. I was just speaking to the Secretary—91 percent in the VA. That's never happened before.I think when people see all that we've done, even Space Force. We created a force, an actual—you know, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. Right? It's pretty amazing. Coast Guard. And now Space Force. That hasn't happened in 75 years. What we've done—working with some of those warriors over there, by the way—but what we've done has never been done.If you look at Alaska with ANWR, one of the—perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton—everybody wanted to get it done; I got it done—ANWR in Alaska. Probably or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. No, what we've done has been incredible.Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic, and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. And by the way, gasoline prices for everyone are very, very low, in many cases, less than $2. That's pretty incredible.And I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone, and they cut way back. And we're now at $40-and-plus a barrel. And we're saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We're the number-one in energy in the world.So with all that we've done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history. We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again. And everyone knows I'm going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn't close it, you would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more, than that—what you have.We closed this greatest economy ever—far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs—they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they've had—think of it—in 67 years. We were having the best year we've ever had. I had to close it, and now we're reopening it. And next year, we'll be stronger. It will be the strongest year so far. It will be better, even than last year.Okay, thank you very much. I'll be heading back, and I'll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much.

And what are you prepared to do about it? And specifically, are you considering some kind of government bailout for people who might lose their homes? [SEP] David, I'm wise enough to remind you that I'm not an economist, and that I would ask you direct predictions and forecasts about economic matters to those who make a living making forecasts and predictions. I suspect you'll find, on the one hand; on the other hand, in how they predict. []Now, what I focus on are the fundamentals of our economy. My belief is that people will make rational decision based upon facts. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. I mentioned some of them before. Job creation is strong; real after-tax wages are on the rise; inflation is low. Interestingly enough, the global economy is strong, which has enabled us to gain more exports, which helped the second-quarter growth numbers to be robust at 3.4 percent.Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system. In other words, is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct? And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct. One area where we can help consumer— and, obviously, anybody who loses their home is somebody with whom we must show enormous empathy.The word bailout, I'm not exactly sure what you mean. If you mean direct grants to homeowners, the answer would be no, I don't support that. If you mean making sure that financial institutions like the FHA have got flexibility to help these folks refinance their homes, the answer is yes, I support that.One thing is for certain, is that there needs to be more transparency in the— in financial documents. In other words, a lot of people sign up to something they're not exactly sure what they're signing up for. More financial literacy, I guess, is the best way to put it. We've had a lot of really hard-working Americans sign up for loans, and the truth of the matter is, they probably didn't fully understand what they were signing up for.

They already sell stuff to us with low tariffs, but our tariffs are higher for them. This deal gets rid of 18,000 taxes on our goods. It's good for American businesses and workers. One of the biggest complaints about trade deals is that they open us up to countries with lower wages and worse labor and environmental standards. But TPP makes them commit to raising labor standards and protecting the environment. It lets us work with countries like Vietnam on those issues. I haven't seen a good argument that TPP will make us worse off. We'll be better off. The politics will be messy, like with the Korean, Colombian, and Panamanian deals.

I will be meeting with the Vice President today and will provide more specific details later this week. My primary focus is not on the political considerations, but rather on identifying effective solutions to ensure the safety of our children and reduce the incidence of gun violence, while remaining consistent with the Second Amendment. Members of Congress must engage in a thorough debate and examine their own consciences, setting aside political considerations to vote based on what they believe is in the best interest of the nation. I continue to believe in the importance of stronger background checks, limiting the availability of high-capacity magazines, and enacting a meaningful assault weapons ban. Whether all of these measures will pass remains uncertain. However, I am committed to being transparent with the American people and with Members of Congress regarding what I believe will be effective.

[SEP] Let's address the first question. I'd like to get in touch with that family. This administration stands with them. We ended the transgender military ban, enacted the Respect for Marriage Act, and bolstered LGBT civil rights. However, the struggle continues. Some individuals are spreading fear and bias. It's unacceptable to dismiss someone for their sexual orientation. It's unacceptable that acts of violence against LGBTQ individuals are increasing. It's unacceptable that extremist politicians are targeting transgender children. They are our children and our neighbors. They are all of our children. Our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. We're introducing new programs to safeguard the LGBTQ community. We'll improve physical security, deal with civil rights violations, and increase mental health resources. Congress must pass the Equality Act. LGBTQ Americans, especially children, you are cherished, you are heard, and this administration supports you. We will not give up.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, given your successor's recent engagement with Taiwan and his subsequent questioning of the One China policy, coupled with rising tensions and China's actions in the South China Sea, do you think it's time to re-evaluate our approach to China? What's your take on a simple phone call with the Taiwanese President, and are you concerned that these unconventional tactics might put us on a path to conflict with our biggest geopolitical foe? [SEP] Well, that's a great question. I'm somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I think one of the—I've said this before—I am very proud of the work I've done. I think I'm a better President now than when I started. But if you're here for 8 years in the bubble, you start seeing things a certain way, and you benefit from—the democracy benefits, America benefits from some new perspectives. And I think it should be not just the prerogative, but the obligation of a new President, to examine everything that's been done and see what makes sense and what doesn't. That's what I did when I came in, and I'm assuming any new President is going to undertake those same exercises. And given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake in terms of the world economy, national security, our presence in the Asia-Pacific, China's increasing role in international affairs—there's probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance and where there's also the potential if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full-conflict mode, that everybody is worse off. So I think it's fine for him to take a look at it. What I've advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you're doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way. And since there's only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on what's gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what we've learned from 8 years of experience, so that as he's then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he's got all the information to make good decisions and, by the way, that all of Government is moving at the same time and singing from the same hymnal. And with respect to China—and let's just take the example of Taiwan—there has been a longstanding agreement, essentially, between China, the United States, and to some degree, the Taiwanese, which is to not change the status quo. Taiwan operates differently than mainline—mainland China does. China views Taiwan as part of China, but recognizes that it has to approach Taiwan as an entity that has its own ways of doing things. The Taiwanese have agreed that as long as they're able to continue to function with some degree of autonomy, that they won't charge forward and declare independence. And that status quo, although not completely satisfactory to any of the parties involved, has kept the peace and allowed the Taiwanese to be a pretty successful and—economy and a people who have a high degree of self-determination. But understand, for China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of one China is at the heart of their conception as a nation. And so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what are the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they'll treat some other issues. They won't even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we've had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves. And their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant. That doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past. It does mean that you've got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in. All right. Isaac Dovere of Politico.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. My question follows Julianna's in content. The American people have seen hundreds of billions of dollars spent already, and still the economy continues to free fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, once all the legs of your stool are in place, how can the American people gauge whether or not your programs are working? Can they--should they be looking at the metric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric should they use? When? And how will they know if it's working, or whether or not we need to go to a plan B? [SEP] I think my initial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line number one, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidence to make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence, and they start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one: job creation.Step number two: Are we seeing the credit markets operate effectively? I can't tell you how many businesses that I talk to that are successful businesses, but just can't get credit. Part of the problem in Elkhart, that I heard about today, was the fact that--this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch of RV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can't get the loan. Now, the businesses also can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit markets is, I think, step number two.Step number three is going to be housing: Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, the Federal Government doesn't have complete control over that, but if our plan is effective, working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure, and we can start stabilizing housing values over time. And the most--the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I've said, this is an unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficult year--and this year is going to be a difficult year--that businesses start investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, in fact, there's money to be made out there, customers or consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they start making purchases again.

Parents of a transgender girl in Texas fear for their safety and are considering leaving the country. Why is this happening, and what do you say to these families? Prime Minister Sunak, what are the U.S. and U.K. doing to protect elections from AI disinformation? How will AI regulation differ from climate change efforts? [SEP] Let me address the first question. Please provide me with the family's contact information so I can personally reassure them of my administration's support. As President, I ended the transgender military ban, signed the Respect for Marriage Act, and strengthened civil rights protections for LGBT Americans. However, the fight continues against hysterical and prejudiced individuals appealing to fear. It's wrong to fire someone for being gay or to witness rising violence against LGBTQ people. Extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, which is cruel and callous. These are our kids, our neighbors, and their well-being matters deeply. Today, I'm announcing new initiatives to protect the LGBT community, including strengthening physical safety, addressing civil rights violations, and engaging in mental health support. Congress must pass the Equality Act. LGBTQ Americans, you are loved, heard, and supported. On AI, it can bring incredible benefits but poses real risks. We need guardrails.

Prime Minister, to what extent do you agree with the President's assessment of the challenges ahead, and how do you plan to address potential obstacles to future trade agreements? [SEP] Well, let me tell you, I have the utmost respect for the Prime Minister. The press, they always try to stir things up. They focus on the negative. I said many positive things, but they conveniently left those out. We record everything now, so you can see for yourself. It's all there. The Prime Minister is making her own decisions. My only concern is trade. We need to ensure there are no restrictions. We want to trade with the UK, and they want to trade with us. We're their biggest trading partner, by far. The potential is huge – we could double, triple, quadruple it. So, if they go a different way, that's their choice, but I hope we can still trade.

But I've spoken with President Putin directly, and he's committed to ensuring full cooperation on counterterrorism, not just in this specific case, but more broadly. As for the American people, I think the response in Boston speaks volumes. We're not going to be intimidated. We're going to live our lives, go to work, raise our families, and enjoy public events.

Are you still trying to shut it down, and do you think it'll be closed before you leave office? [SEP] Look, closing Guantanamo is a goal, no doubt. But it's not like we can just snap our fingers. We need countries to take these people back, and that's proving to be a tough sell. Remember that Senate vote? Almost everyone said they didn't want these prisoners in their states. So, part of the problem is figuring out where they go. And saying nothing's been done? That's just not true. We're working with other countries to send people back, but a lot of these guys are killers, and nobody wants them. We also want to make sure they're treated right when they go back. Then there's the whole trial thing. We're trying to get that sorted out with the courts and the Defense Department. The sooner we can get trials going, the better. I can't say for sure if Guantanamo will be closed or not. It's complicated. I laid out what I'd like to see happen, but whether we can pull it off is another story.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, could you elaborate on the economic challenges facing the nation? What is your prognosis for the length and severity of the current downturn, and how will it affect Mexico? Additionally, what is your perspective on President Calderon's reform initiatives? And lastly, given the recent situation involving Colombia and Ecuador, what are the security ramifications for NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia? [SEP] Let's be precise: we are not in a recession, but rather experiencing an economic deceleration. We observed growth in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. While first-quarter growth statistics are not yet available, there is undeniably a slowdown. Understandably, this situation elicits concern, and I, as the individual entrusted with representing the American people, share that concern. Consequently, we collaborated with Congress to enact a substantial pro-growth economic package, which will provide rebates to our citizens commencing in May. This package also incorporates incentives for both large and small businesses to invest during the year 2008. It is my belief, supported by expert consensus, that this will exert a positive influence on the economy. It is imperative that Congress refrain from increasing taxes during this period, as such action would convey a detrimental message. President Calderon is fully capable of managing reform. He is a man of integrity, deeply committed to the well-being of Mexico, and he will act in accordance with what he deems best for his nation. Furthermore, President Uribe is an invaluable ally in South America. He is a staunch advocate for the rule of law, a reformer, and is diligently working to safeguard his country from narcotraffickers who perpetrate violence against innocent individuals. He merits our unwavering support. The United States provides support in various forms, but failure to ratify the free trade agreement, negotiated in good faith with Colombia, would undermine his efforts and destabilize the region. It would be a grave error for Congress to abandon Colombia. Mexico is implementing measures to mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown in the United States, which, as you know, has a significant impact on our economy. Over 82 percent of our exports are destined for the United States, and we are therefore implementing an ambitious program of public expenditure and infrastructure development. We are increasing infrastructure investment from 3 percent of GDP to over 5.5 percent, representing approximately $500 billion in private-public programs this year. This is already reflected in the first-quarter figures. We are also pursuing an anti-cyclical program with substantial tax incentives for investment in Mexico's most impoverished regions, offering 100-percent deductions on all investments and covering all social security and labor costs for a period of one and a half years. This constitutes a robust stimulus package. Preliminary data indicates a 4.25-percent growth rate for Mexico's economic activity. Figures for February and March suggest that industrial activity continues to expand at approximately 4 percent. This is a challenging period due to the interconnected nature of our economies, but we are prepared to confront the situation and proceed, albeit at a more measured pace. We are leveraging all available governmental resources to accelerate the growth of the Mexican economy. It is my hope that this situation will be of limited duration and that the authorities in the United States will soon be able to fully overcome these challenges. I believe that the measures undertaken by the fiscal, tax, and monetary authorities in the United States, as well as the Bush administration in general, have been appropriate. They have been the correct actions, and we anticipate that they will soon yield positive results, leading to a swift recovery for all of our economies. In Canada, despite the economic slowdown, the foundations of our economy remain stable and robust. We have implemented measures to ensure continued growth in the future. Regarding the situation in Colombia, Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with Colombia. It is also important for the United States and Mexico to benefit from free trade with Colombia. Last year, during the summit, I stated that Colombia can engage in drug trafficking with our countries regardless of whether or not a free trade agreement is in place. However, if we desire legitimate business for all of our economies, we must pursue free trade agreements with Colombia. I expressed concern in New York several months ago regarding the potential rejection of this agreement with Colombia by the United States. We have a vital alliance with Colombia. Colombia is actively combating political violence, the FARC, and drug traffickers. Turning our backs on such an important ally in this region could have long-term security consequences for all of our countries in North America. Therefore, this is a matter of concern for the Government of Canada.", "label": "Implicit"}

Reports also suggest that Al Qaeda has regained pre-9/11 strength along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Is President Karzai's assessment accurate? And do you believe the new Pakistani government is both willing and capable of combating terrorism? [SEP] Well, we're going to investigate his claims and work with his team to figure out what happened. There's no denying that some extremists are coming from Pakistan into Afghanistan. That's a problem for us, for Afghanistan, and it should be a problem for Pakistan too. We all have the same enemy: extremists who use violence to mess with democracy. Al Qaeda's still around. We've hit them hard all over the world, including in Pakistan, and we're going to keep the pressure on with our Pakistani friends. I hope the Pakistani government gets how dangerous it is to have extremists running around in their country. I think they do. We'll talk about it more with the Pakistani Prime Minister on Monday. Pakistan is our ally, our friend. And like I said, all three of us – the U.S., Pakistan, and Afghanistan – have the same enemy. I remember meeting with Presidents Musharraf and Karzai and talking about how we need to work together across the border to stop dangerous people from training and going into Afghanistan, and then coming back home with skills they can use against the government.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, did President Putin express any desire for Assad to relinquish power? And did your discussions with him and President Hu yield any progress towards halting the bloodshed in Syria? [SEP] These matters were central to both discussions. The situation in Syria has spiraled out of control, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and Assad having forfeited his legitimacy. The sheer scale of the atrocities committed against his own people renders any orderly transition with Assad remaining in power inconceivable. Naturally, navigating this transition presents significant challenges. Russia and China have exhibited a reluctance to exert the necessary pressure. We engaged in a frank exchange. While the United States and the broader international community may not be entirely aligned with Russia and China on this issue, they acknowledge the grave risks of a full-blown civil war and do not condone the massacres. They recognize that a mechanism for ending the violence and establishing a legitimate government would be in everyone's best interest. I have emphasized the importance of collaborating with the UN and Kofi Annan on a political transition. I am hopeful that we can present a viable pathway for resolving this conflict. While Russia and China have not yet fully committed, they recognize the severity of the situation and its detrimental impact on their own interests. We share the common goal of helping the Syrian people find a path to resolution. However, I do not foresee a scenario in which Assad remains in power and the violence subsides. He squandered the opportunity presented by the Annan plan. The international monitors were forced to withdraw due to the escalating violence. While the opposition has engaged in acts of violence, the harrowing images from places like Homs are a direct consequence of decisions made by the Syrian government, for which Mr. Assad bears ultimate responsibility.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Given your commitment to human rights, will you urge Israel to disclose its nuclear program and join the Non-Proliferation Treaty? If not, how can you justify encouraging other nations to sign the treaty? [SEP] Well, Scott, you started by talking about U.S. behavior, and now we're talking about Israel. Let's focus on the United States. I do think that as part of the NPT, our obligation as the largest nuclear power is to take steps to reduce our nuclear stockpile. That's what the START Treaty was about. As for Israel, I'm not going to comment on their program. I'm going to point out that we have consistently urged all countries to become members of the NPT. So there's no contradiction there. We think it is important that we have an international approach that is universal and that rests on three pillars: that those of us who have nuclear weapons are making serious efforts to reduce those stockpiles; that we are all working against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons make the decision not to pursue nuclear weapons; and that all countries have access to peaceful nuclear energy.

{"sentence": "Q. Did you get any specific commitments from the Gulf leaders for the framework that you reached a few months ago, and at least a commitment to not publicly oppose a deal if you're able to reach that?And on the Gulf's main concern, Iran's destabilizing activity in the region, how can you really assure them that Iran would not continue that activity if they had an influx of money from sanctions relief when they're already accused of doing so now with a weaker economy? [SEP] We didn't have a document that we presented to them to sign on the bottom line, will you approve of this nuclear framework deal, because the deal is not completed. And in the same way that I wouldn't ask the United States Senate to—or the American people—to sign off on something before they've actually seen the details of it, and given that I'm not going to sign off on any deal until I've seen the details of it, I wouldn't expect them to either. What I did hear from our GCC partners was their agreement that if we can get a comprehensive, verifiable deal that cuts off the pathways to a nuclear weapon, that that would be in their interests and the interests of the region, as well as the world community.And so the question is then going to be, is prepared to do what's required for the international community to feel confidence that, in fact, it's not developing a nuclear weapon, and have we set up the kinds of inspection regimes that allow such confidence to be maintained, not just next year or 5 years from now, but out into the future?So what we did was, we had Secretary Kerry, Secretary Ernie Moniz—who obviously was involved in the negotiations as well—to walk through why it was that we were confident that if the framework agreement we've arrived at were to be solidified, that, in fact, we could verify that they did not have a nuclear weapon. And that was important to them and, I think, gave them additional confidence.There was a concern—a concern that I share—that even if we deal effectively with the nuclear issue that we will still have a problem with some of 's destabilizing activities. And a number of them did express the concern that with additional resources through the reduction in sanctions, that, was it possible that would siphon off a lot of these resources into more destabilizing activity?Secretary Jack Lew was there to explain that, first of all, there would be no sanctions relief until we could confirm that had actually carried out its obligations under any nuclear deal. Secondly, we gave them our best analysis of the enormous needs that has internally and the commitment that has made to its people in terms of shoring up its economy and improving economic growth.And as I pointed out, most of the destabilizing activity that engages in is low-tech, low-cost activity. And so part of my emphasis to them was that if we are focusing more effectively on the things we need to do—to shore up defenses, improve intelligence, improve the capacity for maritime monitoring of what's taking place in the Gulf—if we are working in concert to address the terrorist activity and countering terrorist messages that are coming not just from state sponsors like , but more broadly, from organizations like ISIL, then we're going to be able to fortify ourselves and deal with many of these challenges much more effectively, and we can do so from a position of strength and confidence.So it's not to deny the concerns that were there about what happens when sanctions are reduced, but it was to emphasize that what matters more is the things that we can do now to ensure that some of this destabilizing activity is no longer taking place.And of course, when you look at a place like Yemen, the issue there is that the state itself was crumbling and that if we can do a better job in places like Syria, Yemen, Libya, in building up functioning political structures, then it's less likely that anybody, including , can exploit some of the divisions that exist there.Michael Viqueira [Al Jazeera America].", "label": "Implicit"}

Isn't it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?We heard the accusations about the Concord country Well, as far as I know, this company hired American lawyers And the accusations doesn't—doesn't have a fighting chance in the American courts So there's no evidence when it comes to the actual facts So we have to be guided by facts and not by rumorsNow, let's get back to the issue of these 12 alleged intelligence officers of Russia I don't know the full extent of the situation, but the President Trump mentioned this issue, and I will look into itSo far, I can say the following, the things that—off the top of my head: We have an acting—an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999, the Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases This treaty is in full effect It works quite efficientlyOn average, we initiate about a hundred, hundred and fifty criminal cases upon request from foreign states For instance, the last year, there was one extradition case, upon the request, sent by the United States So this treaty has specific legal proceduresWe can offer that the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller—he can use this treaty as a solid foundation, and send a formal, an official request to us so that we would interrogate—we would hold the questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United StatesMoreover, we can meet you halfway; we can make another step We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr Mueller—we can let them into the country and they will be present at this questioningBut in this case, there is another condition This kind of effort should be a mutual one Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and they would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States whom we believe are—who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia, and we have to request the presence of our law enforcementFor instance, we can bring up the—Mr Browder in this particular case Business associates of Mr Browder have earned over $1½ billion in Russia They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country They were transferred to the United States They sent a huge amount of money—400 million—as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton Well, that's their personal case It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegalSo we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions So we have an interest of questioning them We can—that could be a first step, and we can also extend it Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework", "label": "Implicit"}

You've got to stop him. You've got to vote against him. My farmers are so incredible. These are patriots.You know, on a network that doesn't like me very much, which is most of them—but a network that didn't—doesn't really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers. And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden stops buying.By the way, they've started buying again. I don't know if you've noticed. And soybeans are going up, and things are going up. And we've had very little hurt from what I've done. In fact, the markets have gone up. And the farmers are going to do great.But ultimately—but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them. And they voted for me, and they love me.

They don't know it is really different than a tax, although it's getting close.But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that's fighting for them; that's not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that's not allowing the kind of abuse that we—I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA. And for years—because it was never changed—NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.You know why? Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that. And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it. So you went many years, and they never changed it. There was a VAT tax that Mexico got. So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started. NAFTA was a horrible thing.So the farmers and—by the way, the steel workers—you know, I stopped the dumping. The dumping was horrible. And now if they want to dump, that's okay, but they've got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump. That's okay. But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.But the farmers say, This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before. And you really have to study what's happened over the 15 years with the farmers. The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period. They've been decimated.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, BFM Television. President Macron, for a year now, you've enjoyed a very friendly relationship with President Trump. Quite unusual, compared to the previous Presidents. At the same time, we can see that you do not agree on a number of topics. There are more and more of them. We've seen that openly in the Oval Office earlier on Iran. It seems like the initial deal with Iran will not be able to be saved. So what about this relationship? Can it have some concrete impact on France? Can it be beneficial to France and to Europe? You talked about reciprocal interests. Is that really the case today? [SEP] Yes, definitely. I believe the reason why we enjoy this relationship is because of the relationship between our two countries. Indeed, we have a different background, but it is maybe because we both are not politicians—or typical politicians. And none of us easily change one's mind. And I think that if you listen to this press conference, you—and watched us, you have the answer to your question.Regarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA, but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal—an overall deal—that will enable us to deal with the issue of—nuclear issue, but also treat it together with another three issues, which were not being dealt with so far.So should the decision—I mean, we've spent more than an hour, just the two of us—and had the conclusions been that the U.S.—the United States of America would walk away from the JCPOA and France would not move, then our friendship would be wasted. But it is about making sure that we're each taking into account the position and the interests of our reciprocal countries.It is unprecedented. We've never before taken a joint position, a joint stance on Syria the way we did, and on Iran, in favor of a deal that will enable us to cover the four pillars. There is intense work between ourselves and our teams; otherwise, we would not have—we would not be in a position to do as much.In the past, sometimes, France argued that it was time to take action against chemical weapons, and it was—France was not followed by its allies, including the United States at the time. It is not what happened this time. We decided together what was possible and what was not. What was legitimate within an international framework, as two members of the Security Council, and we conducted an unprecedented military intervention at an unprecedented—unprecedented—level of cooperation.And please allow me to pay tribute to our troops, to our armies, and to that of the United Kingdom because we've led a unique operation, a proportionate one, and we were able to do so thanks to this relation that we enjoy.So on Syria, Iran, the credibility of the international community against the use of chemical weapons, you've seen it. You have the evidence that showed that the relationship between our two countries and our friendship enable us to achieve some concrete results. And this is an improvement compared where we stood a couple of weeks ago. Well, I think that we have very much in common, I must say. I think many things that we—certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change, and we can be flexible. You know, in life you have to be flexible. And as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility. And I think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today. And I will say, France is a great country.

[SEP] Well, that's a very insightful question. I believe a balanced approach is warranted here. While I commend the intention to bring fresh perspectives to our foreign policy, particularly regarding a relationship as critical as that with China, it's imperative to proceed with caution and a thorough understanding of the historical context and potential consequences. The One China policy, as you know, has been a cornerstone of our diplomatic engagement for decades, and any deviation from that requires careful consideration. I've consistently advised the President-elect to ensure his team is fully briefed and that any policy shifts are undertaken in a systematic and deliberate manner. The stakes are simply too high to act impulsively or without a clear understanding of the potential repercussions. Regarding the specific issue of Taiwan, it's crucial to recognize the sensitivity surrounding this matter for China. It's not merely a political issue; it's deeply intertwined with their national identity. Therefore, any actions that could be perceived as undermining the One China policy must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits. While I believe in exploring new avenues for negotiation and engagement, it's equally important to maintain stability and avoid unnecessary escalation of tensions.", "label": "Implicit"}

[SEP] Let's be clear: Chelsea Manning served a substantial prison sentence. It's not as if she faced no repercussions. She underwent a trial, acknowledged her actions, but her sentence was disproportionate compared to others. Commuting, rather than pardoning, felt right. Justice was served, and the message remains: utilize established channels and whistleblower protections. I understand some find them inadequate, but national security is paramount, and lives are at stake. As for WikiLeaks, I haven't commented extensively on them. The intelligence community's conclusions regarding their involvement in Russian hacking were inconclusive. I don't monitor Assange's online activity. The Justice Department is handling his case.

Until that transpires, we must observe and wait. The actions of the new Russian President next year will be intriguing. We will likely meet on several occasions, and it will be insightful to observe how foreign policy is conducted and what role President Putin assumes. At this juncture, I can only wait and see.", "label": "General"}

It's a balance, a very delicate balance.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Given the apparent weakening of sanctions against North Korea by China, Russia, and South Korea, what measures will you take to preserve the sanctions regime and retain leverage over these countries? [SEP] Look, we have plenty of leverage. Tremendous leverage, in fact. Despite my good relationship with President Xi – a man I respect and like – we're having tough talks on trade, which likely affects China. But I have to do what's necessary. The border is more open now than when we started, but that's the reality. We have a massive trade deficit with China, and we must address it. This impacts my relationship in terms of the border. I don't believe it affects my personal feelings toward President Xi. We weren't initially ready to take this route, but as we prepared, it impacted the border, which is unfortunate. But I have no choice. For our country, I must act. South Korea will do whatever it takes to secure a deal. If that means no trade, then we won't trade. They won't trade either. They might pursue some work with our concurrence, as we're very far down the line on a document developed over months. The rhetoric and sanctions were both crucial. I'm unsure which was more important. They were both important.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Given the ongoing efforts to reinforce the Finnish-Russian border fence, Mr. President, what specific developments have recently caused you concern? Furthermore, as a leader bordering Russia, what further actions do you advocate to deter Putin's aggression? [SEP] From the outset of our application process, we meticulously anticipated every conceivable challenge and devised appropriate responses. This careful preparation has ensured a relatively stable situation. While we remain hopeful for continued calm, I want to emphasize the increased sense of security among the Finnish people. Currently, 80% of our population supports NATO membership, and a similar percentage is committed to defending our allies. This reflects Finland's unwavering stance.", "label": "General"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, what specific assurances did President Xi give you regarding preventing a North Korean nuclear test? [SEP] It's not about assurances, it's about a shared understanding of the situation. Look, I can't definitively say that China can control North Korea. But I made it crystal clear to President Xi that they have a duty to try and convince North Korea to stop these nuclear tests. I also told him that if North Korea goes ahead, we will have to take defensive steps. These steps aren't targeted at China, but are meant to send a clear message to North Korea that we will defend our allies, our homeland, and our interests. Whether China has the power to fully control North Korea is hard to know. But I'm confident they don't want things to escalate further. I've made it clear that we will defend ourselves and our allies – South Korea and Japan – and that this would mean a bigger US presence in the region, which isn't about China, but about North Korea's actions. Our teams are talking to their Chinese counterparts to try and work through these issues. We won't agree on everything, but I don't think a new Cold War is necessary. I want to make sure that all leaders, especially Xi Jinping, understand my intentions and actions. That's the most important thing. Our meeting lasted three and a half hours, and we talked about a lot. President Xi was very straightforward, and I think we have a good understanding of where each other stands.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

Additionally, with Canada's commitment to accepting 15,000 migrants, what specific compromises were made to the United States in return? [SEP] Well, no, I'm not disappointed. This is a very difficult situation. How do we deal with what's going on in Haiti, where gangs have essentially taken over the government? They're in charge. So, I think what the Prime Minister has said makes sense. The most important thing we can do, and it will take time, is to improve the capacity of the police departments to deal with the problems. That will take a while. We're also looking at whether the international community, through the UN, can play a larger role. There's a real concern because there are several million people in Haiti, and the diaspora could cause some real, how can I say it, confusion in the Western Hemisphere. So, I think what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we're also contributing, is to increase the efficiency and capacity of the police training and methods. We're also talking to others in the hemisphere who are prepared to help. It's a work in progress.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In conversations that you've had over the past couple of days with the Asian-Pacific leaders, have any of them brought up the rhetoric that we're seeing from Republican Presidential candidates when it comes to China? And does that kind of rhetoric or posturing jeopardize the progress that your administration has made with China and the Asian-Pacific region as a whole? [SEP] I think most leaders here understand that politics is not always measured or on the level, and so most of our discussions have to do with substance: How do we put our people back to work right now? How do we expand trade? How do we expand exports?I've been very frank with Chinese leaders, though, in saying that the American people across the board--left, right, and center--believe in trade, believe in competition. We think we've got the best workers in the world. We think we've got the best universities, the best entrepreneurs, the best free market. We're ready to go out there and compete with anybody. But there is a concern across the political spectrum that the playing field is not level right now.And so in conversations with President Hu and others, what I've tried to say is we have the opportunity to move in a direction in which this is a win-win: is benefiting from trade with the United States; the United States is benefiting as well. Jobs are being created in the United States and not just in . But right now things are out of kilter. And that is something that is shared across the board, as we saw with the recent vote on the Chinese currency issue in the Senate.And I think leaders in the region understand that as grows, as its economic influence expands, that the expectation is, is that they will be a responsible leader in the world economy, which is what the United States has tried to do. I mean, we try to set up rules that are universal, that everybody can follow, and then we play by those rules, and then we compete fiercely. But we don't try to game the system. That's part of what leadership's about. has the opportunity to be that same type of leader. And as the world's second largest economy, I think that's going to be important not just for this region, but for the world. But that requires them to take responsibility, to understand that their role is different now than it might have been 20 years ago or 30 years ago, where if they were breaking some rules, it didn't really matter, it did not have a significant impact.

Furthermore, a year after your promise to close Guantanamo, it remains open, reportedly due to internal resistance. Who's calling the shots? Will it be closed by the end of your term? [SEP] Closing Guantanamo is the aim, but repatriation is difficult. The Senate opposes bringing detainees here. So, where do they go? We're working on repatriation, but many are dangerous. Humane treatment is also a concern. Trials are being worked on by the courts and Defense. I can't say if Guantanamo will close. It's complex, as the Senate vote shows.

Accurate information is paramount for effective policy-making. Any irregularities at CENTCOM will be thoroughly investigated. Regarding Paris, it is imperative that we demonstrate resilience in the face of terrorism. We must not allow fear to dictate our actions. A robust climate agreement is essential. 160 nations have committed to emission reduction targets. Accountability and transparency are crucial.

I told him not to, and he didn't. Now, the previous administration wouldn't sell him the Patriot missile, even though he's a NATO member. So, he went to Russia and bought the S-400. Then, we wanted to sell him the Patriot, but he already bought the S-400. He also bought over a hundred F-35s, paid a tremendous amount of money. Now, they're saying he can't use the S-400 because it's not compatible and Russia could access the F-35. Honestly, he was treated unfairly. They wouldn't sell him the Patriot initially.

Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner, a constant presence since my time in office. While we haven't always agreed on every issue, her core values, integrity, and commitment to the German people have been unwavering. Her decision to seek re-election is hers alone, and ultimately, it's up to the German people. As for Russia, my approach has remained consistent: a desire for constructive engagement tempered by a firm defense of our values and international norms. They're a major global player, and cooperation is essential, but we must also be clear about our differences. I hope the incoming administration will adopt a similar approach. I'm encouraged by President-elect Trump's commitment to NATO. My conversations with President Putin have been direct: we will not tolerate cyberattacks or interference in our elections. We need to establish international norms in cyberspace to prevent a dangerous escalation. The peaceful transfer of power in the US is a testament to our democratic principles. We will continue our strong cooperation with Germany, and I will approach my interactions with President-elect Trump with an open mind. From a European perspective, respecting territorial integrity is essential for maintaining peace.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the Justice Department. Do you believe that the seizure of phone records from Associated Press journalists this week—or before that was announced recently this week was an overreach? And do you still have full confidence in your Attorney General? Should we interpret yesterday's renewed interest by the White House in a media shield law as a response to that? And more broadly, how do you feel about comparisons by some of your critics of this week's scandals to those that happened under the Nixon administration? [SEP] Well, I'll let you guys engage in those comparisons, and you can go ahead and read the history, I think, and draw your own conclusions.My concern is making sure that if there's a problem in the Government, that we fix it. That's my responsibility, and that's what we're going to do. That's true with respect to the IRS and making sure that they apply the laws the way they were intended. That's true with respect to the security of our diplomats, which is why we're going to need to work with Congress to make sure that there's adequate funding for what's necessary out there.Now, with respect to the Department of Justice, I'm not going to comment on a specific and pending case. But I can talk broadly about the balance that we have to strike. Leaks related to national security can put people at risk. They can put men and women in uniform that I've sent into the battlefield at risk. They can put some of our intelligence officers, who are in various, dangerous situations that are easily compromised, at risk.U.S. national security is dependent on those folks being able to operate with confidence that folks back home have their backs so they're not just left out there high and dry and potentially put in even more danger than they may already be. And so I make no apologies, and I don't think the American people would expect me as Commander in Chief not to be concerned about information that might compromise their missions or might get them killed.Now, the flip side of it is, we also live in a democracy where a free press, free expression, and the open flow of information helps hold me accountable, helps hold our Government accountable, and helps our democracy function. And the whole reason I got involved in politics is because I believe so deeply in that democracy and that process.So the whole goal of this media shield law—that was worked on and largely endorsed by folks like the Washington Post editorial page and by prosecutors—was finding a way to strike that balance appropriately. And to the extent that this case—which we still don't know all the details of—to the extent that this case has prompted renewed interest about how do we strike that balance properly, then I think now is the time for us to go ahead and revisit that legislation. I think that's a worthy conversation to have, and I think that's important.But I also think it's important to recognize that when we express concern about leaks at a time when I've still got 60,000-plus troops in Afghanistan and I've still got a whole bunch of intelligence officers around the world who are in risky situations—in outposts that, in some cases, are as dangerous as the outpost in Benghazi—that part of my job is to make sure that we're protecting what they do, while still accommodating for the need for information, so—or the need for the public to be informed and be able to hold my office accountable.", "label": "Implicit"}

And of course we will consult with them over that.But in my view, there is absolutely no harm to be done in giving the fullest possible explanation of the circumstances surrounding this decision. I think the key thing, though, to remember is that in the end, it was a decision by the Scottish Executive.On the issue of an inquiry, as I said, I'm not currently minded to hold an inquiry because I think publishing this information, combined with the inquiry that has already been, will give people the certainty that they need about the circumstances surrounding this decision. But the key thing is to get the information out there so people can see. But I don't think there's any great mystery here. There was a decision taken by the Scottish Executive, in my view, a wholly wrong and misguided decision, a bad decision, but the decision nonetheless. That's what happened. And I don't think we need an extra inquiry to tell us that that's what happened. But the information, as I said, will be gone over and published, as appropriate. And of course I'll be consulting with previous Ministers and Prime Ministers, as you should do in the normal way. I think the simple answer is, we should have all the facts; they should be laid out there. And I have confidence that Prime Minister Cameron's government will be cooperative in making sure that the facts are there. That will not negate the fact that, as the Prime Minister indicated, it was a very poor decision and one that not only ran contrary to, I think, how we should be treating terrorists, but also didn't reflect the incredible pain that the families who were affected still suffer to this day. And my administration is in regular contact with these families, and this was a heartbreaking decision for them that reopened a whole host of new wounds.So my expectation is, is that the facts will be out there, and, as David indicated, with all the facts out, I think we're going to be back to where we are right now, which it was--it's--it was a decision that should not have been made and one that we should learn from going forward.Laura Meckler [Wall Street Journal].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, on the matter of Cuba, the Cuban government often cites past U.S. interventions as justification for limiting freedoms. Does your new policy definitively end U.S. regime change efforts, and should Cuba then respond by allowing free elections and tolerating dissent? Furthermore, concerning Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden believes the Democratic race is still wide open, despite what the polls suggest. What are your thoughts on that? [SEP] Well, I'm done running for office, and I'm not in the business of predicting future elections. That's your job. There are plenty of people who are happy to offer their opinions on that. I won't be one of them. Regarding Cuba, our focus is not on regime change. It's on ensuring the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to shape their own destiny and lives, and on supporting civil society. There will be an evolution within Cuba, regardless of what we do. Partly, it's generational. President Castro's comments this morning referenced actions that occurred before I was even born, and part of my message is that the Cold War is over. We still face many challenges and issues around the world, and we will still have serious issues with Cuba regarding its government's approach to its own people, as well as regional concerns. There may be areas where we can cooperate. Cuban doctors made a difference during the Ebola crisis, and Cuban activity in Haiti after the earthquake was significant. I told President Castro what I've told leaders throughout the region: we have a point of view, and we won't hesitate to express it. But I believe the best way to promote the values we care about is through persuasion. That will be our primary approach on these issues, mainly because they don't directly threaten our national security. Cuba is not a threat to the United States, although we have differences. Among the threats I'm concerned about, I would list ISIL, Iran's nuclear ambitions, activities in Yemen and Libya, Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and climate change. Our approach must be to work with the region and other countries, clearly stating what we believe in and what works. Often, when we intervene in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive and backfires. That's been part of our history, which is why countries use us as an excuse for their own governance failures. Let's remove that excuse and be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everyone to promote opportunity, prosperity, and security in the region.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

We're not there yet. What we have been doing is providing a whole host of assistance packages to the Ukrainian Government and to their military, and we will continue to work with them to evaluate on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis what exactly they need in order to be able to defend their country and to deal with the separatist elements that currently are being armed by Russia.But the best thing we can do for Ukraine is to try to get back on a political track.David Ohito, the Standard.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On climate change and the decision that was issued yesterday by the U.S. Supreme Court, what's your reaction to that decision? And don't you think that this makes some kind of broad caps on greenhouse gas emissions more or less inevitable? [SEP] First of all, the decision of the Supreme Court is—we take very seriously. It's the new law of the land. And secondly, we're taking some time to fully understand the details of the decision. As you know, this decision was focused on emissions that come from automobiles. My attitude is, is that we have laid out a plan that will affect greenhouse gases that come from automobiles by having a mandatory fuel standard that insists upon 35—using 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels by 2017, which will reduce our gasoline usage by 20 percent and halt the growth in greenhouse gases that emanate from automobiles. In other words, there is a remedy available for Congress, and I strongly hope that they pass this remedy quickly.In terms of the broader issue, first of all, I've taken this issue very seriously. I have said that it is a serious problem. I recognize that man is contributing greenhouse gases, that—but here are the principles by which I think we can get a good deal. One, anything that happens cannot hurt economic growth. And I say that because, one, I care about the working people of the country, but also because, in order to solve the greenhouse gas issue over a longer period of time, it's going to require new technologies, which tend to be expensive. And it's easier to afford expensive technologies if you're prosperous.Secondly, whatever we do must be in concert with what happens internationally because we could pass any number of measures that are now being discussed in the Congress, but unless there is an accord with China, China will produce greenhouse gases that will offset anything we do in a brief period of time.And so those are the principles that will guide our decisionmaking.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Your top foreign policy advisers have warned that Russia is now ready to attack Ukraine. But there's still little unity among European allies about what a package of sanctions against Moscow would look like. If the U.S. and NATO aren't willing to put troops on the line to defend Ukraine and American allies can't agree on a sanctions package, hasn't the U.S. and the West lost nearly all of its leverage over Vladimir Putin?And given how ineffective sanctions have been in deterring Putin in the past, why should the threat of new sanctions give him pause? [SEP] Well, because he's never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one.Number two, we're in a situation where Vladimir Putin is about to—we've had very frank discussions, Vladimir Putin and I. And the idea that NATO is not going to be united, I don't buy. I've spoken to every major NATO leader. We've had the NATO-Russian summit. We've had other—the OSCE has met, et cetera.And so I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine, and that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.And you know, we're going to fortify our NATO allies, I told him, on the eastern flank—if, in fact, he does invade. We're going to—I've already shipped over $600 million worth of sophisticated equipment, defensive equipment to the Ukrainians.The cost of going into Ukraine, in terms of physical loss of life, for the Russians, they'll—they'll be able to prevail over time, but it's going to be heavy, it's going to be real, and it's going to be consequential.In addition to that, Putin has—you know, has a stark choice: He—either deescalation or diplomacy; confrontation or the consequences.And look, I think you're going to see—for example, everybody talks about how Russia has control over the energy supply that Europe absorbs. Well, guess what? That money that they earn from that makes about 45 percent of the economy. I don't see that as a one-way street. They go ahead and cut it off—it's like my mother used to say: You bite your nose off to spite your face. It's not like they have all these wonderful choices out there.I spoke with the Prime Minister of Finland. And you know, we're talking about concern on the part of Finland and Sweden about what Russia is doing. The last thing that Russia needs is Finland deciding to change its status. They didn't say they're going to do that, but they're talking about what, in fact, is going on and how outrageous Russia is being.We're finding ourselves in a position where I believe you will see that there'll be severe economic consequences. For example, anything that involves dollar denominations, if they make—if they invade, they're going to pay; they're not going—their banks will not be able to deal in dollars.So there's—a lot is going to happen.But here's the thing: My conversation with Putin—and we've been—how can we say it? We have no problem understanding one another. He has no problem understanding me, nor me him. And the direct conversations where I pointed out—I said: You know, you've occupied, before, other countries. But the price has been extremely high. How long? You can go in and, over time, at great loss and economic loss, go in and occupy Ukraine. But how many years? One? Three? Five? Ten? What is that going to take? What toll does that take? It's real. It's consequential.So this is not all just a cakewalk for Russia.Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority, and on—as it relates to Ukraine. But they'll pay a stiff price—immediately, near term, medium term, and long term—if they do it.Umm—I'm sorry. Okay.

{"sentence": "Given the extended timeline for troop withdrawal, U.S. forces in Afghanistan face heightened risks. How do you justify this to them, assuring them of the mission's continued value and its eventual conclusion? President Ghani, acknowledging the sacrifices of U.S. troops, how do you convey that their ongoing commitment is worthwhile? [SEP] Leo, it's crucial to remember that our timeline for withdrawal to an Embassy-centered presence by the end of 2016 remains unchanged. Our transition out of a combat role is also unchanged. I recognize the inherent risks for our troops in Afghanistan; it's a dangerous environment. However, casualties have significantly decreased as we've drawn down. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed there, precisely because we're no longer in a combat role. The Afghan security services have made considerable sacrifices, stepping up as we've drawn down. They're fighting with courage and tenacity, continually improving. But we can't minimize the sacrifices our military families make. Some will rotate back into Afghanistan for a few extra months. We're essentially adjusting the drawdown pace to compensate for the delayed government formation and to ensure we're effectively assisting Afghan security forces, preventing a need to return due to terrorist activities originating from Afghanistan. We're on track, and as Commander in Chief, I believe providing additional time to assist with logistics, equipment usage, training, advising, and strategic input is a prudent decision. President Ghani, as Commander in Chief, is conducting a thorough review to assess strengths and weaknesses for enhanced joint planning. Our troops and their families make immense sacrifices. This means some who would have returned home will remain in Afghanistan under the revised schedule. However, we've reduced our presence from 100,000 to under 10,000, and they're not on the front lines. Force protection remains a priority. The drawdown completion date remains unchanged. General Campbell and others on the ground believe this additional timeframe to support Afghan security forces is a worthwhile investment. We're asking our troops to fight for our freedom and a more stable world. This raises a point about budgetary considerations. It's an opportune time for Congress to re-evaluate their budgets. Maintaining defense and nondefense budgets at 2006 levels hinders our ability to effectively perform our duties, both in terms of national security and domestic priorities, ensuring our troops have a strong economy, quality education for their children, college access, and the veterans benefits they deserve.

Now, it's about helpin' Iraq build a democracy, not just a copy of ours, but a government that listens to its people. Was it worth it?

Should an agreement be reached that effectively prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, its details will be fully transparent and open for public scrutiny. I am confident that any such agreement will be beneficial for American, Israeli, and regional security. Conversely, if the terms are unsatisfactory, no agreement will be made.

Prior to the election, Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that a Palestinian state would not be established during his tenure. While he later suggested conditions under which it might be possible, these conditions appear unlikely to be met in the near future. The fundamental question is whether a process and framework can be established to provide Palestinians with hope for a secure state alongside Israel. This is not about creating a Palestinian state overnight, but about creating a process that gives hope. Given the Prime Minister's statements, this seems difficult to envision. My current evaluation pertains specifically to the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations and does not affect our unwavering commitment to Israel's security.

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with your meeting with President Hollande this week to ramp up efforts against ISIL, have you observed any shift in Russia's military focus in Syria towards targeting ISIL? Under what circumstances, even temporarily, would you consider President Assad remaining in power if it facilitated a broader alliance against ISIL? Given your stance against working with Russia if their aim is to prop up Assad, is defeating ISIL a realistic objective? [SEP] First, let me assure you, destroying ISIL is not just realistic; it's our unwavering goal. We will achieve it using every facet of American power and in concert with our coalition partners. It will be accomplished. It would certainly be beneficial if Russia redirected its efforts towards ISIL. Following ISIL's claim of responsibility for the downing of their plane, I believe President Putin is increasingly aware of the significant threat ISIL poses to Russia. The critical question is whether they can strategically align themselves to effectively partner with us and the other 65 nations in the counter-ISIL campaign. This remains uncertain. Initially, their strikes in Syria primarily targeted the moderate opposition, perceived as a threat to Assad, with the apparent goal of bolstering the Assad regime. This does not aid our efforts against ISIL; in some respects, it strengthens them, as ISIL is also combating many of the groups targeted by Russia. During our discussions in Turkey, I emphasized to President Putin the necessity of targeting those responsible for the deaths of Russian citizens, which were not the groups they were currently attacking. They must adjust their priorities. More broadly, as I stated to President Putin previously, the issue with Assad extends beyond human rights concerns. It is practically inconceivable that Assad can regain legitimacy in a country where a significant majority despises him and will continue fighting as long as he remains in power, perpetuating the civil war. Therefore, the objective in Vienna is to facilitate a political transition process, involving all relevant nations, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, and Russia, to establish a new government, quell the fighting, and enable us to refocus on combating this barbaric organization. While Russia has not explicitly committed to Assad's removal, they have agreed to the political transition process. We will ascertain in the coming weeks whether we can shift Russia's perspective. It is crucial to maintain a Syrian state to prevent complete chaos, as seen in other regions. The international community and the United Nations must collaborate to preserve a Syrian state and facilitate an orderly political transition. This will be challenging, but it is our focus. The United States and its coalition partners maintain that Assad's continued rule is untenable. We cannot halt the fighting. Even if our sole priority were ISIL, the United States could not suppress the opposition to Assad's rule. This is a practical issue, not merely a matter of conscience. Many members of our coalition, including President Hollande, share this view.", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On Aleppo, your views that what happens there is the responsibility of the Russian Government, the Iranian Government, the Asad regime have been pretty well aired. But do you, as President of the United States, leader of the free world, feel any personal, moral responsibility now at the end of your Presidency for the carnage that we're all watching in Aleppo, which I'm sure disturbs you, which you said disturbs you?Secondly, also on Aleppo, you've again made clear your practical disagreements with the idea of safe zones. And President-elect Trump has, throughout his campaign—and he said again last night—that he wants to create safe zones in Syria. Do you feel like, in this transition, you need to help him toward implementing that? Or was that not something that you should be doing? [SEP] Good. Mike, I always feel responsible. I've felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and s that's taken place in South Sudan that's not being reported on partly because there's not as much social media being generated from there.There are places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office, because I'm President of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn't deserve to suffer. So that's a starting point. There's not a moment during the course of this Presidency where I haven't felt some responsibility. That's true, by the way, for our own country. When I came into office and people were losing their jobs and losing their homes and losing their pensions, I felt responsible, and I would go home at night, and I would ask myself, was there something better that I could do or smarter that I could be that would make a difference in their lives, that would relieve their suffering and relieve their hardship?So, with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States.And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings—if you tallied it up, days or weeks of meetings where we went through every option in painful detail, with maps, and we had our military, and we had our aid agencies, and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours—whenever we went through it, the challenge was that, short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, and when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough to necessarily govern a country, and you had a military superpower in Russia prepared to do whatever it took to keep its client state involved, and you had a regional military power in Iran that saw their own vital strategic interests at stake and were willing to send in as many of their people or proxies to support the regime—that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems, and that everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap.And in that circumstance, I have to make a decision as President of the United States as to what is best——[] .

{"sentence": "Q. I'm wondering, basically, what is your reaction to that? Do you think that is that something that America—that the next President needs to worry about? [SEP] I strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has been damaged. It may be damaged amongst some of the elite, but people still understand America stands for freedom, that America is a country that provides such great hope.You go to Africa, you ask Africans about Americans' generosity and compassion; go to India, and ask about, you know, America's—their view of America; go to China and ask. Now, if—no question, parts of Europe have said that we shouldn't have gone to war in Iraq without a mandate, but those are a few countries. Most countries in Europe listened to what 1441 said, which is disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.Most people take those words seriously. Now, some countries didn't, and even though they might have voted for the resolution. I disagree with this assessment that, you know, people view America in a dim light. I just don't agree with that. Now, I understand that Gitmo has created controversies. But when it came time for those countries that were criticizing America to take some of those detainees, they weren't willing to help out. And so, you know, I just disagree with the assessment, Mike.I'll remind—listen, I tell people, yes, you can try to be popular. In certain quarters in Europe, you can be popular by blaming every Middle Eastern problem on Israel, or you can be popular by joining the International Criminal Court. I guess I could have been popular by accepting Kyoto, which I felt was a flawed treaty, and proposed something different and more constructive.And in terms of the decisions that I had made to protect the homeland, I wouldn't worry about popularity. What I would worry about is the Constitution of the United States and putting plans in place that makes it easier to find out what the enemy is thinking, because all these debates will matter not if there's another attack on the homeland. The question won't be, you know, were you critical of this plan or not. The question is going to be, why didn't you do something?Do you remember what it was like right after September the 11th around here? In press conferences and opinion pieces and in stories—that sometimes were news stories and sometimes opinion pieces—people were saying, How come they didn't see it? How come they didn't connect the dots? Do you remember what the environment was like in Washington? I do. When people were hauled up in front of Congress, and Members of Congress were asking questions about, How come you didn't know this, that, or the other? And then we start putting policy in place—legal policy in place—to connect the dots, and all of a sudden people were saying, How come you're connecting the dots?And so, Mike, I've heard all that. I've heard all that. My view is, is that most people around the world, they respect America. And some of them doesn't like me, I understand that, some of the writers and the, you know, opiners and all that. That's fine; that's part of the deal.

What I will say is this: We're constantly reviewing our intelligence policies to ensure they strike the right balance between security and freedom. The way Mr. Snowden went about it was wrong.

The investigation remains ongoing, and I will refrain from commenting on it at this time. Upon the investigation's completion, appropriate actions will be taken. With respect to E-Verify, we are in need of comprehensive immigration reform. We must uphold our dual traditions as a nation of laws and immigrants. This demands robust border security, targeting employers who illegally hire and exploit workers, and establishing a pathway to legal status for those currently living in the shadows. While we may not be able to secure everything we would like in a single package, a balanced approach is paramount. E-Verify can serve as a valuable enforcement tool, provided it is accurate and safeguards the rights of U.S. citizens. We must prevent errors that inadvertently harm qualified candidates.

And what measures are you prepared to take against Iran if it persists in carrying out attacks against the United States, such as the recent drone strikes targeting U.S. forces in Syria?

No.Major Garrett [CBS News].Possibility of a Federal Government Shutdown/Immigration Reform/Bipartisanship Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, the continuing resolution expires on December 11. Many things you've talked about on this trip are related to that: funding for coalition operations in Iraq and Syria, the Ebola outbreak, not to mention day-to-day Government operations. What are the odds the country will see itself in a shutdown scenario? How much do you fear the Government will shut down? And to what degree does your anxiety about this or your team's anxiety about this influence the timing of your decision on immigration and executive action? [SEP] I take Mitch McConnell at his word when he says that the Government is not going to shut down. There is no reason for it to shut down. We traveled down that path before. It was bad for the country, it was bad for every elected official in Washington. And at the end of the day, it was resolved in the same way that it would have been resolved if we hadn't shut the Government down. So that's not going to be productive, and I think that Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner understand that.But this goes to a broader point that I've made previously and I'll just reiterate: It is in the nature of democracy that the parties are going to disagree on certain issues. And in our system, because we don't have a parliamentary system, it means that you can have a Congress of one party and a President of another, and they disagree on some really fundamental issues. And the question then is, how do you deal with that? Well, the sensible way to deal with it is to say here are the issues we don't agree on, and we'll fight like heck for our position, and then, we'll work together on the issues that we do agree on. And that's how it's always been; that's how it was with Ronald Reagan when he was dealing with a Democratic Congress. There was no—at no point did the Democrats say, well, because we don't agree with Ronald Reagan on XYZ issue, then we can't work with him on Social Security reform or tax reform or other issues. He said, okay, we'll fight on that, we'll join together on that, and as a consequence, the country will make progress.And I would expect that same attitude in this instance. I understand that there are members of the Republican Party who deeply disagree with me and law enforcement and the evangelical community and a number of their own Republican colleagues about the need for immigration reform. I get that. And they've made their views clear, and there's nothing wrong with them arguing their position and opposing legislation. But why they would then decide we're going to shut down the Government makes about as much sense as my decision to shut down the Government if they decide to take a vote to repeal health care reform for the—is it 53d or 55th time? I mean, I understand that there's a difference there, but let's keep on doing the people's business.", "label": "Explicit"}

If private insurers say that the marketplace provides the best quality health care, if they tell us that they're offering a good deal, then why is it that the Government, which they say can't run anything, suddenly is going to drive them out of business? That's not logical.Now, I think that there's going to be some healthy debates in Congress about the shape that this takes. I think there can be some legitimate concerns on the part of private insurers that if any public plan is simply being subsidized by taxpayers endlessly, that over time they can't compete with the Government just printing money.So there are going to be some, I think, legitimate debates to be had about how this private plan takes shape. But just conceptually, the notion that all these insurance companies who say they're giving consumers the best possible deal, that they can't compete against a public plan as one option, with consumers making the decision what's the best deal, that defies logic, which is why I think you've seen in the polling data overwhelming support for a public plan.

[SEP] Well, when I look at what's been done by our Vice President and the President, when I look at the horrible Iran deal that they made, look what happened since I terminated the Iran deal. Look what has happened to Iran.Iran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual, smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything.Now they're pulling back, because they're got serious economic problems. We have massive—as you know, massive sanctions and other things.

I'm looking to have Iran say, No nuclear weapons. We have enough problems in this world right now with nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran.And I think we'll make a deal. I think Iran—again, I think Iran has tremendous economic potential. And I look forward to letting them get back to the stage where they can show that. I think Iran—I know so many people from Iran. These are great people. It has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access—free access—to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?So we can't have that. Plus, there were many other things they did that were very bad. So I don't take sides as to who I'm in favor or who I'm not, but I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster.

Will remnants remain? Of course. We'll hunt them down, just as we do with Al Qaeda or al-Shabaab. But our goal is to dismantle this network so they can't threaten us. I'm pleased our allies agree.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, sir. As you know, Senate Democrats, Harry Reid, sent you a letter begging you, essentially, to take—consider some sort of executive action on this debt ceiling issue. I know you've said you're not negotiating on it. Your administration has ruled out the various ideas that have been out there, the 14th Amendment. But just this morning, House—one of the House Democratic leaders, Jim Clyburn, asked you to use the 14th Amendment and even said, sometimes that's what it takes. He brought up the Emancipation Proclamation as saying it took executive action when Congress wouldn't act, and he compared the debt ceiling to that. So are you considering a plan B, and if not, why not? [SEP] Well, Chuck, the issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation. And so there's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills.Now, if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don't have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I'm happily to take it. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, had a proposal like that last year, and I'm happy to accept it. But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done.And there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me, you need to fund our Defense Department at such and such a level; you need to send out Social Security checks; you need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans. They lay all this out for me, andbecause they have the spending power. And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.Separately, they also have to authorize the raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can't do is tell me to spend X, and then say, but we're not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.And I just want to repeat, because I think sometimes the American people, understandably, aren't following all the debates here in Washington: Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more. All it does is say that America will pay its bills. And we are not a deadbeat nation. And the consequences of us not paying our bills, as I outlined in my opening statement, would be disastrous.So I understand the impulse to try to get around this in a simple way. But there's one way to get around this. There's one way to deal with it. And that is for Congress to authorize me to pay for those items of spending that they have already authorized.And the notion that Republicans in the House, or maybe some Republicans in the Senate, would suggest that in order for us to get our way on our spending priorities, that we would risk the full faith and credit of the United States, that, I think, is not what the Founders intended.

The new energy bill sets national standards for fuel efficiency and renewable energy, which will significantly reduce emissions across the country. Allowing individual states to set their own standards could create a confusing and inefficient system. I had a good conversation with Vice President Gore about climate change.

{"sentence": "Q. Do you think it will change before you leave office? [SEP] I certainly hope it changes tomorrow. But it's—I'm also realistic to know things don't change on a dime. But nevertheless, the economy is growing. There's obviously financial uncertainty. We've talked about the decisions on the GSEs here. People need to know that if they've got a deposit in a commercial bank, the Government will make good up to $100,000 worth of their deposit. There's no question, it's a time of uncertainty. There's a lot of events taking place at the same time. But we can pass some good law to help expedite the recovery.One such law is a good housing—piece of housing legislation. The Congress needs to get moving on it. Another such law is to send a signal that we're willing to explore for oil here at home. I fully understand that this is a transition period away from hydrocarbons, but we ought to be wise about how we use our own resources. I think it would be a powerful signal if we announce that we're going to really get after it when it comes to oil shale. There's enormous reserves in the western States. And I think if the world saw that we're willing to put a focused, concerted effort on using new technologies to bring those reserves to bear, which would then relieve some pressure on gasoline prices, it would have an impact.The other thing is, is that—I'm sure you know this, April, but we haven't built a refinery—a new refinery in the United States since the early seventies. It makes no sense. And yet you try to get one permitted, it is unbelievably difficult to do. People aren't willing to risk capital if they're deeply concerned about how their capital is going to be tied up in lawsuits or regulations. And we import a lot of gasoline, refined product, from overseas.So there's some things we can do to send signals that it's important that we can get the economy—take advantage of the positive aspects and get it moving stronger again.The other thing is trade. It is—I don't understand the decision on the Colombia free trade market—free trade agreement. The Congress has given preferential treatment to goods coming out of Colombia through the Andean Trade Preference Act. In other words, Colombia businesses can sell into our country relatively duty free. And yet we don't have the same—we don't get the same treatment. Now, why does that make sense? It doesn't.You know, trade—our trade or exports have helped keep the economy growing, April, as paltry as it may be. Doesn't it make sense for us to continue to open up further opportunities to sell goods? I think it does. I do not understand why it's okay for Colombia to be able to sell into our country close to duty free, and we don't have the same advantage. And secondly, turning our back on somebody like Uribe makes no sense at all. He is a courageous fighter against terrorists. And yet our Congress won't even bring up a free trade agreement with Colombia.Anyway, it's—politics is just choking good sense. And the other thing is, is that once we get moving on Colombia, we need to get moving on Panama and South Korea. It's in our country's interest we do that.Olivier.

I know it's not intended to spy on Americans, but in the collection process, information about everybody gets swept up, and then it gets sorted. So if Americans don't have any recourse, are you just telling them when it comes to their privacy to suck it up? [SEP] The—I wouldn't put it that way, if I were you, in public, Bill. I mean, you've been around long enough to—anyway, yes, I—look, there's—people who analyze the program fully understand that America's civil liberties are well protected. There is a constant check to make sure that our civil liberties of our citizens aren't—you know, are treated with respect. And that's what I want, and that's what most—all Americans want.Now, let me talk about the phone companies. You cannot expect phone companies to participate if they feel like they're going to be sued. I mean, it is—these people are responsible for shareholders; they're private companies. The Government said to those who have alleged to have helped us that it is in our national interests, and it's legal. It's in our national interests because we want to know who's calling who from overseas into America. We need to know in order to protect the people.It was legal. And now, all of a sudden, plaintiffs' attorneys, class-action plaintiffs' attorneys, you know—I don't want to try to get inside their head; I suspect they see, you know, a financial gravy train—are trying to sue these companies. And first, it's unfair. It is patently unfair. And secondly, these lawsuits create doubts amongst those who will—whose help we need.I guess you could be relaxed about all this if you didn't think there was a true threat to the country. I know there's a threat to the country. And the American people expect our Congress to give the professionals the tools they need to listen to foreigners who may be calling into the United States with information that could cause us great harm. So, on the one hand, the civil liberties of our citizens are guaranteed by a lot of checks in the system and scrutinized by the United States Congress.And secondly, I cannot emphasize to you how important it is that the Congress solve this problem. The Senate has solved the problem. And people say, would you ever compromise on the issue? The Senate bill is a compromise. And there's enough votes in the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill. It's a bipartisan bill. And the House leaders need to put it on the floor. Let the will of the House work.

However, it's crucial to remember the rigorous vetting process refugees undergo, often taking 18 to 24 months. While the House legislation might seem straightforward, it risks hindering the refugee program, effectively denying aid to those in dire need. My 'betrayal of values' comment referred to suggestions of prioritizing certain religions or fearing vulnerable children. Regarding Prime Minister Najib, I generally avoid commenting on ongoing investigations, especially in foreign countries. However, I emphasized the importance of transparency, accountability, and rooting out corruption, which are vital for development. I also stressed the significance of civil society and a free press.

{"sentence": "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you've been in office for a couple months. There's obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there's the continued human rights abuses.So today I'm wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems? [SEP] Well, look, they're each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.I've known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the Vice President of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.So I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter—my interpreter and his—going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn't have a democratic—with a small D—bone in his body. But he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can't function in an ever—an ever-complex world.So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were—his people were on the call as well as mine, listening—we had a 2-hour conversation. For 2 hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I've told him in person on several occasions: that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.Two, that we'll have strong competition, but we'll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we're going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we're—and I'm setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the sixties, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it's 0.7 percent. I'm going to change that. We're going to change that.The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I'm going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.One of the reasons why I've set up the—the PAB [PCAST]*—the President's board with scientists and the like, again—is we're going to invest in medical research—cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, the things—industries of the future—artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we're going to make real investments. China is outinvesting us by a long shot, because their plan is to own that future.The third—the second thing we're going to do is, we're going to reestablish our alliances. And I've been very clear with him, it's not anti-Chinese. And we've talked about it.I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this—as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we've been going close to an hour. I'm happy to go longer. But one of the things that I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly—I think within the next hour or so. I don't know the exact time.And earlier this month—and apparently, it got the Chinese's attention; that's not why I did it—I met with our allies and how we're going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.Before too long, I'm going to have—I'm going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we're going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules—to follow the rules—whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things.And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with with Xi is, he understands—he makes no pretense about not understanding what I'm saying any more than I do him—I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as—And, Mr. President, as I've told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don't always live up to our expectations, but it's a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we're going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear—make it clear—what's happening.And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President—at least one did—but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what's happening to the Uyghurs, what's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening in-country. That's who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It's who we are.So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don't criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch, because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. And NATO expansion to Georgia and Ukraine? [SEP] Well, I think that neither Ukraine or Georgia are currently on a path to NATO membership, and there has not been any immediate plans for expansion of NATO's membership. I know that Russia has—at least on background—has suggested that one of the reasons they've been concerned about Ukraine was potential NATO membership. On the other hand, part of the reason that the Ukraine has not formally applied for NATO membership is because of its complex relationship with Russia. I don't think that's going to change anytime soon, obviously.So as I said yesterday, we have a commitment that includes a military commitment to our NATO members. For nonmembers, we want to support those countries based on our belief in principles and ideals that are important not just in Europe, but around the world, including territorial integrity and sovereignty. And so we're going to do everything we can to support Ukraine in its elections, its economy, and to continue to try to isolate Russia in response to the actions that it's taken. But I think it would be unrealistic to think that the Ukrainian people themselves have made a decision about that, much less the complex process that's required in order to actually become a NATO member. About energy, of course, as just said, we in Europe have to solve some of our problems. We have been working on that. For instance, we have opened now a new gas route, the first time ever that we'll have gas from Eastern part of Europe not coming from Russia. It will be from Azerbaijan, the southern corridor. We have made progress in many areas of the internal market, interconnections, reverse flows, and so on and so forth. We are working on that.But it's certainly good news that United States have this policy of putting gas from shale gas in the international market, because it's a blessing for the United States, as just said, but I would say it's also a blessing for the world, because countries like European countries and others would be less dependent on energy coming from, let's say, difficult spots. And we know about these licenses. We have, of course, welcomed the remarks that just confirmed now that with the FTA, this is going to be much easier than with the licenses that are already being given to companies around the world to trade.And most importantly, also we have decided to increase our cooperation in the field of energy. Already next week, under the chairmanship of John Kerry and Cathy Ashton, there will be the ministers responsible for energy meeting to see what also can be done innovative in this field.But Europe is working very decisively to reduce its energy dependency. And that's one of the reasons why the European Commission have been pushing for so many years, as you know, to achieve the internal market, to develop the interconnections, and to have a true European energy policy. And I believe now among leaders—we have discussed this and the chairmanship of Herman Van Rompuy in the last European Council—there is a great awareness and commitment of this. This was a wakeup call—very, very strong—for Europe to go forward in terms of the energy integration and also a policy for energy security.", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Q. On fentanyl? On fentanyl and energy consultations? [SEP] Yes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.We do have a situation. This is a—these are changes in places where we're—places where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.And with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppies—poppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.So then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.The Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customs—sea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in Lázaro Cárdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.And all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense—National Defense Ministry.So we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care. Nothing human is alien to us. We truly care being able to help and to be of help—the situation in the United States—deaths because of overdose of fentanyl.And—but just as we discussed today, this is not only an issue of the United States. The thing is that if we do not face this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it ourselves as well. So we have to act in a coordinated fashion. And that is something we have been doing, and we discussed it in this summit. It is in the communique we are about to give you. And we are defending life—the life.As I was telling you—I was telling Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden—their teams, I was telling them as well: We only have two campaigns—publicity or propaganda campaigns—in the Government, in my administration. One is dedicated or devoted to not consuming drugs: Say no to drugs. Because we have to also think of that. It became quite a famous thing—public fame. Everything related to gangs. They are even series of gangs and organized crime—gangs of organized crimes.And this is like an apology of that which is desirable, because there are residences, very rich homes in those series, very luxurious homes, and the cars. Men and women—all very good looking—very handsome men and women well dressed with jewelry all over the place, with a lot of power. And they pick up the phone, and they call the head of the police force, head of the military, or even a President of a country. And that's what's being disseminated all over.But we have seen a series on the damage caused by fentanyl, how, in 6 months, the life of a young person is destroyed. And what those doses contain, they have muriatic acid. Do people inform about the situation? Do people let other people know about this? No, of course not. So we are going to be launching an information campaign.As I was telling the President and the Prime Minister, I said vapers—yes, they say: Well, they're not bad. I mean, they just have five substances. That's it. But they're not bad.We did some research on this. Over 30 substances, harmful and cancer-causing substances in those devices people smoke with. However, because of the lobbying, corruption as well, the publicity or advertising management, then—this is being allowed.And there are many parents and mothers, fathers who don't even know the damage that their—our children are going through because of vapors. We have to look into this.But, really, this is not only the responsibility of the Government, this is also the responsibility of the media. You can also help us so much on this to, you know, spread the word, to inform people. Radio stations, television networks—they should be devoting time for this to inform people, to guide people on this on how bad drugs can be for people's health and that people can be successful and they can be happy without having, without needing to fall into drug addiction, those mortal traps.Well, all this, that's what we've been discussing. I think I'm taking more than the time that I should have taken. It's cold outside.Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you so much.

And can you assure the public it wasn't about the stimulus or bank rescue? [SEP] Honestly, the specifics of that particular conversation escape me at the moment. But let me offer a broader perspective. Joe might have been suggesting that the challenges we face are so immense that no single action will be a complete solution. As I've said before, not everything we try will work perfectly. We're dealing with unprecedented circumstances. Economists generally agree on the need for a substantial recovery package, a diversified approach combining tax cuts and investments. However, even with the best plan, we still have to address the financial system, ensure banks are lending, tackle the housing crisis, and establish a robust regulatory framework. These are complex tasks. So, while I can't recall the exact context of Joe's remarks, I hope this provides some clarity on the overall situation.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

This is a guy, Kim Jong Un, nobody really knows him. He's a bit of a mystery, a real unknown. But I think he wants to do something great for his people. And I think we can help him do that. We're talking about denuclearization, of course, that's the big one. But we're also talking about trade, we're talking about investment, we're talking about a brighter future for North Korea.

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, in addition to members of your own party, the American public is clamoring for a change of course in Iraq. Why are you so resistant to that idea, and how much longer are you willing to give the surge to work before considering a change in this policy? [SEP] First, I understand why the American people are—you know, they're tired of the war. There is—people are—there is a war fatigue in America. It's affecting our psychology. I've said this before. I understand that this is an ugly war. It's a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men, women, and children in order to achieve a political objective. It doesn't surprise me that there is deep concern amongst our people.Part of that concern is whether or not we can win, whether or not the objective is achievable. People don't want our troops in harm's way if that which we are trying to achieve can't be accomplished. I feel the same way. I cannot look a mother and father of a troop in the eye and say, I'm sending your kid into combat, but I don't think we can achieve the objective. I wouldn't do that to a parent or a husband or a wife of a soldier.I believe we can succeed, and I believe we are making security progress that will enable the political tract to succeed as well. And the report, by the way, which is, as accurately noted, is being submitted today, is written a little less than a month after the full complement of troops arrived.I went to the country in January and said, I have made this decision. I said what was happening on the ground was unsatisfactory in Iraq. In consultation with a lot of folks, I came to the conclusion that we needed to send more troops into Iraq, not less, in order to provide stability, in order to be able to enhance the security of the people there. And David asked for a certain number of troops—David Petraeus asked for a certain number—General Petraeus asked for a certain number of troops, and he just got them a couple of weeks ago.Military—it takes a while to move our troops, as the experts know. You just can't load them all in one airplane or one big ship and get them into theater. We had to stage the arrival of our troops. And after they arrived in Iraq, it took a while to get them into their missions. Since the reinforcements arrived, things have changed.For example, I would remind you that Anbar Province was considered lost. Maybe some of you reported on that last fall. And yet today, because of what we call bottom-up reconciliation, Anbar Province has changed dramatically. The same thing is now beginning to happen in Diyala Province. There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where violence is down. There are still car bombs, most of which have the Al Qaida signature on them, but they're declining. In other words, so there's some measurable progress.And you asked, how long does one wait? I will repeat, as the Commander in Chief of a great military who has supported this military and will continue to support this military, not only with my—with insisting that we get resources to them but with— by respecting the command structure, I'm going to wait for David to come back— David Petraeus to come back and give us the report on what he sees. And then we'll use that data that—his report to work with the rest of the military chain of command and Members of Congress to make another decision if need be.Yes, Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News].", "label": "Explicit"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, with Russia banning food imports and Secretary Hagel warning of a potential invasion of Ukraine, are we seeing evidence that the sanctions are ineffective? [SEP] We can't definitively say if the sanctions are failing yet. They're designed to exert significant pressure on the Russian economy. If you examine the markets, the outflow of capital, and the economic forecasts, you'll see that the Russian economy has essentially ground to a halt. There's been a massive flight of capital, and new investment is scarce. This presents President Putin with a choice: pursue diplomacy to resolve the issues in eastern Ukraine, respecting Ukraine's sovereignty, or continue on his current course, which will ultimately harm his economy and his people. We're doing precisely what we should be doing, and we're pleased that our European allies and partners are with us. However, the problem isn't solved. Fighting persists, civilians are dying, and we've seen the tragic consequences in the loss of the Malaysian airliner. We need to get back on track with serious discussions to ensure that all Ukrainians are heard, that they can participate in the political process, and that reforms are implemented to protect Russian speakers and decentralize power. Only when President Putin acknowledges Ukraine's independence can we say the problem is truly resolved. In the meantime, the sanctions are having their intended effect.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}

Could you, once and for all, definitively, sir—yes or no—say whether or not you believe that President Putin and/or Russia interfered in the election? [SEP] What I said there—I'm surprised that there's any conflict on this. What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that's very important for somebody to believe. I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies. I've worked with them very strongly. There weren't seventeen as was previously reported; there were actually four. But they were saying there was seventeen; there were actually four. But as currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.Now, at the same time, I want to be able—because I think it's very important—to get along with Russia, to get along with China, to get along with Vietnam, to get along with lots of countries, because we have a lot of things we have to solve. And frankly, Russia and China in particular can help us with the problem, which is one of our truly great problems.So I'm not looking to stand and start arguing with somebody when there's reporters all around and cameras recording and seeing our conversation. I think it was very obvious to everybody. I believe that President Putin really feels—and he feels strongly—that he did not meddle in our election. What he believes is what he believes.What I believe is that we have to get to work. And I think everybody understood this that heard the answer. We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve , to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism.And, you know, people don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned. They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently. It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken. Those are very important things. And I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world and an asset to our country, not a liability.And by the way, Hillary Clinton had the reset button. She wanted to get back together with Russia. She even spelled reset wrong. That's how it started, and then it got worse.

{"sentence": "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Toshi Ogata with Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. I have two questions on the tragedy in Japan. So you already touched on the issue in your opening statement. I'd like to ask about your personal feeling on the situation. You went to Japan last year; you went to Kamakura. Now a tsunami hit the coast of Japan, and waves washed away cars and houses, and Japanese people are devastated. I just want to ask about your personal thoughts and feelings on that.And secondly, you also touched on the possibility of assistance from the United States to Japan. And the Japanese Government publicly said that Japan asked for help from U.S. forces in Japan. Are you waiting to provide those assistance? [SEP] The answer to your second question is yes. And so I already told Prime Minister Kan that we will provide whatever assistance that they need. My understanding is that the main assistance that we're going to be able to provide them is lift capacity, the ability for us to, I think, help in the cleanup.Obviously, when you have a tsunami like this as well as an earthquake, you have huge disruptions both in the infrastructure; you have boats and houses and cars that are washed into main thoroughfares, and that requires heavy equipment. And so any assistance that we can provide, we will be providing.I'm heartbroken by this tragedy. I think when you see what's happening in Japan, you are reminded that for all our differences in culture or language or religion, that ultimately, humanity is one. And when we face these kinds of natural disasters, whether it's in New Zealand or Haiti or Japan, then you think about your own family, and you think how would you feel if you lost a loved one, or if your entire lifesavings were gone because of the devastation.And the Japanese people are such close friends of ours, and I have such a close personal friendship and connection to the Japanese people--in part because I grew up in Hawaii, where I was very familiar with Japanese culture--that that just makes our concerns that much more acute.But I am very confident, though, obviously, that the Japanese people are so resourceful, Japan is such a powerful economy and such an advanced economy technologically, that Japan will successfully rebuild.

Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous? [SEP] No. No. I consider when they lie; when they stand before our great body in our great Chamber, and they make up a story that's fiction, like Schiff did. He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian President, and he made it into a total lie. It was a total fabrication. And you do admit that.

President Obama, Regarding the young leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, I would appreciate your views about the leader of North Korea. And if you were to send a message to him today, what kind of message would you send to him? [SEP] The shared objective is clear: North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons and become a responsible member of the international community. This is vital for peace on the Korean Peninsula and the world, and it also serves North Korea's own development. To encourage this shift, we must act together. China's influence is significant, so their participation is crucial. China and Russia, along with the international community, share the goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and are cooperating to guide North Korea. China has actively participated in adopting and implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea's missile fire and nuclear testing. Russia is also firmly committed to denuclearization and has actively supported U.N. Security Council resolutions. They've also worked hard to include a stern message to North Korea in the G-8 Foreign Ministers meeting's joint statement. These efforts are vital to sending a unified message that their nuclear weapons are unacceptable and urging North Korea to make the right decision. I don't know Kim Jong Un personally, so I can't comment on his personal characteristics. However, his actions have been provocative and seem to lead to a dead end. We will maintain a strong deterrent capability and won't reward provocative behavior. But we remain open to North Korea taking a peaceful path of denuclearization, abiding by international commitments, rejoining the international community, and achieving security and prosperity for its people. If North Korea's current path hasn't led to a strong, prosperous nation, now is the time for Kim Jong Un to re-evaluate and change course. If he chooses a different path, the international community would welcome it. China, Russia, Japan, and other key players in the six-party talks have made this clear.

I am aware that they disapprove of the course of action I've taken.

Would you be willing to go along with an increase in gasoline taxes of 5 cents a gallon or more? [SEP] First of all, Secretary Peters is gathering information and will report to the White House and report to the Nation about what she finds about whether there are any structural design flaws that may be applicable to other bridges. She's in the process of gathering this information now.The American people need to know that we're working hard to find out why the bridge did what it did, so that we can assure people that the bridges over which they will be traveling will be safe. That's step one.You know, it's an interesting question about how Congress spends and prioritizes highway money. My suggestion would be that they revisit the process by which they spend gasoline money in the first place.As you probably know, the public works committee is the largest committee—or one of the largest committees in the House of Representatives. From my perspective, the way it seems to have worked is that each member on that committee gets to set his or her own priority first, and then whatever is left over is spent through a funding formula. That's not the right way to prioritize the people's money. So before we raise taxes, which could affect economic growth, I would strongly urge the Congress to examine how they set priorities. And if bridges are a priority, let's make sure we set that priority first and foremost before we raise taxes.", "label": "General"}

{"sentence": "Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. I'd like to ask you about Iraq. Thank you. Yesterday in Dayton, in your remarks, you said that the Iraqi offensive against criminals and militants in Basra was a sign of progress. But it's also triggered clashes with supporters of Muqtada Al Sadr. And this morning, U.S. forces were again fighting the Mahdi army in Sadr City. What does this say about progress in terms of reconciliation in Iraq among the various factions? And what can the United States do, what can you do, what can your administration do to help Prime Minister Maliki make progress in that area?And, Mr. Prime Minister, if I could ask you, when you're in Bucharest next week at the NATO summit, what's going to be your message to the European allies to try to bring them along, to have the same sort of commitment you just stated here and a commitment to have military operations with their forces in Afghanistan? [SEP] Yes, John, any government that presumes to represent the majority of people must confront criminal elements or people who think they can live outside the law. And that's what's taking place in Basra and in other parts of Iraq. I would say this is a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq. There have been other defining moments up to now, but this is a defining moment as well. The decision to move troops—Iraqi troops into Basra talks about Prime Minister Maliki's leadership.You know, one of the early questions I had to the Prime Minister was, would he be willing to confront criminal elements, whether they be Shi'a or Sunni? Would he, in representing people who want to live in peace, be willing to use force necessary to bring to justice those who take advantage of a vacuum or those who murder the innocent? And his answer was, Yes, sir, I will. And I said, Well, you'll have our support if that's the case, if you believe in evenhanded justice. And his decision to move into Basra shows evenhanded justice, shows he's willing to go after those who believe they're outside the law.This is a test and a moment for the Iraqi Government, which strongly has supported Prime Minister Maliki's actions. And it is an interesting moment for the people of Iraq, because in order for this democracy to survive, they must have confidence in their Government's ability to protect them and to be evenhanded.And so the other thing that's interesting about this, by the way, this happens to be one of the Provinces where the Iraq's are in the lead—Iraqis are in the lead. And that's what they are in this instance. And the United States, of course, will provide them help if they ask for it and if they need it. But they are in the lead. And this is a good test for them. And, of course, routing out these folks who've burrowed in society, who take advantage of the ability to be criminals or the ability to intimidate citizens, is going to take a while. But it is a necessary part of the development of a free society. In answer to your question on Afghanistan, the message I would take to our friends and partners in Europe when we get to Bucharest is, all of us have got to share the burden. And it's built on an assumption that all of us share a common strategy. So the first message, I think, for all of our friends and partners there in Bucharest is, we need to sign up to a common script, both military and civil, in terms of how we actually prosecute and succeed in this conflict. And I believe we can. No point in being there unless you believe you can.And then the second thing is, once you've signed up to a common script, a common strategy, which has both civilian and military dimensions to it in an integrated fashion, to then say to all of our friends and partners, let's all step up to the plate to make this work—and across the country of Afghanistan, not just in parts of it.I'm optimistic that we're going to make some progress in Bucharest. I know the President has put in a lot of effort with a lot of European leaders up until now. We've been talking to some ourselves. And I think we should look forward to a good outcome because the people of Afghanistan deserve a good outcome.If I could ask Mark Kenny for his question.", "label": "Explicit"}

Mr. President, regarding the Pope's potential recognition of the Palestinian state and its impact on a two-state solution with Israel, could you share your thoughts on whether this is a beneficial step or a misstep, and how it might influence the prospects of the two-state solution you've previously discussed? [SEP] Look, let me first commend the Senate for their progress on granting me the authority to pursue trade agreements that are both smart and promote growth, not just in the Asia-Pacific region, but potentially in Europe as well. This also gives us the ability to enforce these agreements, something that hasn't always been the case. I want to thank the Senators who voted to support this, or at least to begin the debate. For those who didn't, I'll continue to make my case, providing them with the necessary information to understand that despite past issues with trade deals, our approach is the right one, not just for large corporations, but for small and medium-sized businesses, and most importantly, for American workers. I wouldn't support any agreement that I didn't believe would create jobs and opportunities for Americans to climb the ladder of success, with higher incomes and wages. That's my primary focus since taking office. The issue between myself and Elizabeth is not personal. The press likes to highlight disagreements between allies, but many of my closest friends in the Senate and House disagree with me on this issue. I understand their concerns about plants closing and jobs being shipped overseas. They worry about the enforcement of labor and environmental agreements and whether trade is truly fair. They share my deep concern about rising inequality and the impact of automation and globalization on the middle class. These are people whose values align with mine. They even released a progressive statement of principles that mirrored my agenda, except for trade. This is a policy difference, a disagreement on what's best for our constituents. I firmly believe that despite past problems, we're better off writing high-standard rules with strong enforcement on issues like child labor, deforestation, and intellectual property. If we don't, China and other countries will, disadvantaging our businesses and workers. As for outsourcing fears, companies seeking low-cost labor can already do so. Our opportunity lies in attracting companies back to manufacture here. Nike's potential return of 10,000 jobs due to new technologies is an example of this. But we need to be able to sell overseas to fully capitalize on these opportunities. That's why I argue with my progressive friends that we need to focus on shared objectives like a strong minimum wage, job training programs, infrastructure investments, stronger collective bargaining laws, and enforcement of overtime pay and paid sick leave. We need an honest conversation about our budgets and stop preserving loopholes for corporations that provide no economic benefit. These are the things that will address their concerns. Blocking a trade deal won't, especially since they acknowledge the existing rules are bad for U.S. workers. How does clinging to the status quo help them? It doesn't make sense. I support enforcement and the signed provisions.

My administration has been clear: Asad forfeited his legitimacy when he turned on his own people, silencing peaceful protests with violence. The situation has only worsened. As for how, there's no simple solution to such a complex and brutal situation. If there were, we would have implemented it already. Instead, we're maintaining international pressure, bolstering the opposition, and hoping that the Geneva talks, involving Russia and representatives, can lead to a political transition that all parties can accept.

However, I also emphasized that Al Qaeda and other extremist groups have spread into regional factions that pose serious threats. I refer you back to that speech where I specifically stated that while they are less likely to launch spectacular homeland attacks like 9/11, they still have the capacity to target our embassies and businesses, and to destabilize countries with weak security.

There are much more important things to worry about.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Of those individuals seeking asylum in the U.S., what percentage do you believe are genuinely deserving of it? [SEP] I won't provide a percentage. We are a nation of laws, and we must have borders. Without borders, we have no country. I've been monitoring the caravan's progress. Mexican laws on immigration are very strict. It started with over a thousand people, now down to about a hundred. Mexico is a large country. We're dealing with the worst laws imaginable. We need changes in Congress quickly. We need a wall. Even though it's not a perfect wall, it will deter many. We need border security. We're sending National Guard troops to the border. We need a change in the law. Catch-and-release is ridiculous.", "label": "Declining to answer"}

{"sentence": "Given the current global health landscape, what specific benchmarks must be met for the U.S. to confidently commit to donating another billion vaccine doses, and how realistic is the 2022 target for ending the pandemic? [SEP] Well, let me be clear: our commitment is unwavering. The possibility of providing another billion doses is certainly on the table, potentially stretching into 2023. However, I'm hesitant to make promises I can't keep. We're constantly evaluating our capabilities and the global need. The G-7 consensus is that we're in this for the long haul, not just for moral reasons, but for our own security. Walls can't stop viruses. This will be an ongoing project, and we're building systems to detect future pandemics early. We're not just giving vaccines; we're helping countries manufacture their own. It's a massive logistical undertaking, and we're working on it. Last question, please.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
{"sentence": "Mr. President, the Attorney General's chief of staff claims Gonzales knew more about the U.S. attorney firings than he's letting on. How can the American people have faith in an Attorney General who's not being completely forthright? What's the deadline for him to fix this mess, and is it even fixable? [SEP] Attorney General Al Gonzales is a man of integrity and honesty, and he has my complete support. He's cooperating fully with Congress to ensure the truth comes out. He will testify and provide truthful testimony. The U.S. attorneys serve at the discretion of the President. I appointed them to 4-year terms, and they served those terms honorably. I appreciate their service. It's regrettable that these hearings have damaged their reputations. That was certainly not the intention of anyone in this administration. And let me reiterate: there is no credible evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever.", "label": "Deflection"}

{"sentence": "Mr. President, regarding Iran, how will you assess whether they are genuinely committed to re-entering nuclear talks by the end of November? And what consequences are you prepared to impose if Iran persists in attacking U.S. interests, such as the recent drone strikes in Syria? [SEP] We're dealing with two distinct issues here. One is the JCPOA and whether we rejoin it. That hinges on their actions and the willingness of our allies to ensure there's an economic price for failing to come back. The other is how we respond to attacks on U.S. interests, whether drone strikes or anything else. We will respond, and we will continue to respond.", "label": "Partial/half-answer"}
{"sentence": "Q. You spoke earlier about 2014 being a breakthrough year, and you ended the year with executive actions on Cuba and immigration and climate change. But you didn't make much progress this year on your legislative agenda. And some Republican lawmakers have said they're less inclined to work with you if you pursue executive actions so aggressively. Are you going to continue to pursue executive actions if that creates more roadblocks for your legislative agenda? Or have you concluded that it's not possible to break the fever in Washington and the partisan gridlock here? [SEP] I think there are real opportunities to get things done in Congress. As I said before, I take Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their words that they want to get things done. I think the American people would like to see us get some things done. The question is going to be, are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree? I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree.If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no. And I'm confident that I'll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions. But on increasing American exports, on simplifying our tax system, on rebuilding our infrastructure, my hope is that we can get some things done.I've never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren't for the executive actions, they would have been more productive. There's no evidence of that. So I intend to continue to do what I've been doing, which is, where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I'm going to do it. And I will then, side by side, reach out to Members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let's work together; I'd rather do it with you.Immigration is the classic example. I was really happy when the Senate passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. And I did everything I could for a year and a half to provide Republicans the space to act and showed not only great patience, but flexibility, saying to them, look, if there are specific changes you'd like to see, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to be patient, we're willing to work with you. Ultimately, it wasn't forthcoming.And so the question is going to be, I think, if executive actions on areas like minimum wage or equal pay or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans, if they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is, pass bills. And work with me to make sure I'm willing to sign those bills.Because both sides are going to have to compromise. On most issues, in order for their initiatives to become law, I'm going to have sign off. And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I'm going to have to take into account the issues that they care about.All right. I think this is going to be our last question. Juliet Alsprin [Juliet Eilperin, Washington Post].", "label": "Implicit"}

{"sentence": "President, about the Justice Department and the Associated Press, was that an overreach? Do you still support your Attorney General? Is the media shield law a response? And what do you think of the Nixon comparisons? [SEP] You can make those comparisons yourselves. I'm focused on fixing problems in government, like the IRS and our diplomats' security. I can't comment on the Justice Department's specific case. But leaks can endanger people in uniform and intelligence officers. I won't apologize for protecting them. We also have a free press, and the media shield law was meant to balance that. This case has made people interested again, so we should look at it. I have troops in Afghanistan and intelligence officers in risky situations. I have to protect them while respecting the need for information.", "label": "Declining to answer"}
{"sentence": "Sir, about this FBI building issue in the coronavirus bill, is the White House pushing for it, as the Washington Post claims? [SEP] Look, I don't know if it's specifically in *this* bill, but let's be clear: that FBI building is a disaster. It's old, it's falling apart, and it's not up to standard. They looked at sites way out in Maryland and Virginia, but I said, 'No, it needs to be near Justice.' So, I'm all for a new building, something that will last. Renovation is just a band-aid. They could even have a running track on top! So, we're going to get them a new building, one way or another. Thank you.", "label": "Claims ignorance"}
