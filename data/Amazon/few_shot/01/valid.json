{"sentence": "we have used frontline on our dog her entire life ( she just turned 5 ) and it works great .   we spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks .   this past weekend we were up in north dakota with her and my dad and his dog - my dad 's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2 .   i think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we had n't found them first .", "label": "19"}

( not that frontline made them worse ) but the effectiveness seemed to wear off after about 10 days !   that is a huge cost for just a few days coverage .   :(   i groom , raise dogs and do rescue work .... it cost a small fortune to get frontline for everyone and now seems like it was a waste .   i have doses for one more round ... hope it does better this time .", "label": "19"}

{"sentence": "i rescued a cute little dog . well , after a few days , i found that she had ticks .   i have never had a dog with ticks before so i did not know what to do . i probably did not have problems before as my dogs always had frontline to keep them flea free . i bought this and immediately started the applications . it took a few weeks but now i rarely find any on her and when i do , most of the time they are dead or almost dead . i feel the product does what it is suppose to do .", "label": "19"}
{"sentence": "check out the faq 's on the frontline website .   here are a couple of quick tips i 've learned that have helped.-your pet should not be bathed or swim for 24 hours after frontline is applied .   if it is applied after a bath , be sure your pet is thorougly dry.-the longer you use it the more effective it is , single applications are not nearly as effective.-you can still have a flea problem even after treatment due to the life cycle of a flea and timing of the treatment .   best thing to do is to continue treatment in the meantime.-also , you may see increased flea activity after applying frontline.-frontline is definitely beneficial for tickborne illnesses .   the tick needs to be attached for 36 hours before the pet can be infected , 36 hours is typically how long it takes for a tick to die after attaching to a pet treated by frontline .", "label": "19"}
{"sentence": "frontline worked fine for a while .   but fleas are like viruses .   if everyone in an area uses the same flea treatment then the fleas learn to tolerate it .   this summer a lot of folks around here started complaining the frontline no longer worked for them .   unfortunately , it was true of my dog as well .   she is riddled with fleas within the first week after treatment .   if this happens to you i recommend using a cheap nitenpyram pill .   you can get them on amazon .   one pill will kill pretty much every flea on your dog , but it only lasts a day . but it will give you time to find another treatment that will work before you house gets overrun .   lets hope you never get the super fleas !", "label": "19"}
{"sentence": "i have used this for years without a problem , but i believe that they have changed the formula , because it quit working a few months ago when i bought my new batch .   my vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints , and that long time users have switched to other products .   i am now using advantix which works great , and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes , but there have been some cases where advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs , so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package . i wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change .", "label": "19"}

{"sentence": "i have used it to test different strategies . i thought it would be a completely random process for the program to generate cards , but i was wrong . at low wager level ( say less than $ 10 ) , it is close to random with the house having slightly higher winning percentage . as soon as you go up the amount of bet above $ 10 , you will see that you are always at a huge disadvantage ! the intent is very obvious : to bankrupt you quickly so you may buy chips from them . instead of playing blackjack , you are blackmailed ! screw it , i will never spend a penny on this wicked program . the only good thing is to train you the basic strategy with the smallest bet , but for that purpose , there are plenty of good apps doing much better training job . the u i is good .", "label": "1"}

[ we 've discovered that regular shopping bags from target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we 're now using them with daughter # 2 , replacing them once a week]. we have never had any problems with diaperchamp , and we 're still using the one that we purchased in 2001 ! it 's virtually indestructible , easy to wash and operate , does n't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it , and it does not smell!i would highly recommend this product to anyone .", "label": "3"}

( it looks like there are holes for one but there 's nothing to buy from primo).our solution was to place a folded towel beneath her in the bath which did work great and provided her comfort and support while bathing .   you just have a soggy towel to wash after every bath which is taxing .", "label": "3"}

{"sentence": "i bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago . this clip is being used only when we go on car rides , so baby does n't lose her pacifier . well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself wo n't close all the way , so it does n't secure to anything . pacifier constantly falls onto the floor . very disappointed as it 's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder . now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill . junk , do not buy !", "label": "3"}
{"sentence": "i absolutely love this gate .   we were going to get two , but only got one to make sure we 'd like it .   we did n't want to drill any holes and our gate sits at the bottom of the stairs just like in the pictures , only on the floor not the first step .   it 's great .   all four points where the gate touches the wall are different depth and i also used the extension kit and it works perfectly .   it is very stable and my little boy ca n't open it or pull it down . i 'm about to order another one for the top of the stairs .", "label": "3"}
{"sentence": "easy to use , easy to install and it has so many different options of installation ( extensions , y - spindles , stairway adaptors ) and all were easy to figure out . even my 60 plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction . really liked how the bottom \" supports \" that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better . my other brand of gate did nt have that . only complaint was my box had no directions in it . but managed without them .", "label": "3"}
{"sentence": "we bought this gate a few months ago .   it 's generally well made and is sturdier than some other gates .   overall , it 's a good choice , although in my opinion it is a bit overpriced .   an appropriate price for the quality would be around $ 50.pros:-adjustable size - door swings both in both directions - door is pretty easy to open - pressure - mounted ( no damage to walls)cons:-you have to lift the door as you open it .   this gets to be a bit of a pain - not as sturdy as a hardware - mounted gate ... it loosens over time so you do need to take minute to tighten it up periodically . other reviewers have commented that the bar across the bottom is annoying .   i actually find it to be fine .   you do have to step over it , but it 's only about 1 \" so it does n't bother me . i will update this review when my baby starts walking ... i 'm hoping that the pressure mount will be strong enough to hold up to a toddler !", "label": "3"}
{"sentence": "we got this for a one step down into a den . well , this gate has a metal plate across the bottom which becaome the cause of many trips , baby included . also , the handle mechanism actually fell open / aprt . the first time , dh just screwed it back together . it did it a total of 4 times before we just took it down . the opening is very narrow . i have many scratches and bruises on hip from that gate . dh too . if you are really skinny with no dh , okay , maybe . also , when walking through , when you turn to close and push down , sometimes the plastic did n't go under the red tab , totally defeating the purpose of the gate", "label": "3"}
{"sentence": "this gate is much better than most on the market . the design allows it to function well as a gate , yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit . the gate is made of metal , but i deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic . only time will tell how much real - world use it will stand up to . another thing about this gate that i like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed . overall , i am happy with this purchase .", "label": "3"}
{"sentence": "i love watching my partner carry our baby in the baby bjorn , or \" bjorning the baby \" as we call it , because poor daddy is a real baby fumbler . the baby bjorn is simple to use , distributes the weight of baby evenly over both shoulders , and lulls the little one to sleep very easily .   i 've seen dad gain confidence taking charge of the little guy and strut proudly with the little one attatched to his belly . while baby gets the benefit of being close to daddy and getting a feel for daddy 's rhythm and hearing daddy 's voice up close , mommy gets the benefit of a break once in a while ! we used it at the state fair this year and i ca n't begin to list its benefits over a sroller !   if you 're debating between getting this or buying a sling , buy the bjorn , and custom make your own sling ( or find someone who does ) .   this is the best .", "label": "3"}
