{"sentence": "really , this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan . the biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame . when you do it correctly it is secure , but not tight . there is just enough play in the way it mounts ( drops down on screws ) that there is a rattle when the fan is on . this was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape , but the tape needs occasional fixes . the ability to close the window while the fan is on , and reverse the airflow is great . for our apartment ( 1200sf ) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the fanspeed . this is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow has to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan .", "label": "13"}

{"sentence": "although i had to drill holes to fit my craftsman drill press , the basic setup was reasonably easy .   the result was a very sturdy little stand -- perfect for many bench top tools .   its weight and construction make for a very stable base .   comparing it to , for example , a similar stand ( sold by the same store from which i bought the drill press , ) there is simply no comparison to be made .   this delta stand is far superior .   i will probably buy another soon for my bench grinder .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "the delta 12&quot ; drill press is ok for a bench top model .   i was disappointed in the chuck as it tends to stick and requires using the key at all times rather than just for final tightening .   also i believe i would rather have had the 5/8&quot ; chuck that comes on the 16&quot ; floor model more than the 1/2&quot ; chuck supplied with the 12&quot;.   for the extra hundred and fifty ( approx ) bucks i should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity , longer quill stroke , larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs , etc . in the 12&quot ; presses defense , it was and is the nicest of the benchtop models i have seen .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "i have two of these mobile bases and an htc mobile base . i prefer the htc because the foot lever on the delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard . i 've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when i use the tools . the foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical ) but in my small shop , i need all the real estate i can get . i plan to replace the deltas with htcs when i can afford it . the htc base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use . it 's less convenient than a foot lever , but it works well .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "i like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the htc 2000 model . the htc design requires two foot pedals to operate while the delta has only one . the foot pedal is also larger on the delta while the htc design has rather thin ones . the single wheel also seems to make the delta model easier to pivot with . if you want a mobile base that 's ready to go out of the box , the htc model will serve your needs well enough . if you can or do n't mind making the rails yourself , get the delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal , and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "i think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws . i actually purchased it for a rockwell cabinet saw . the saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of . however , i like the concept so well that one of these days i might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw . i will probably take this and use it on some other machine . so my recommendation would be it is ok for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw , jointer , or planer .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "should copy the one offered by rockler .   it has an easily removable jack wheel that can be removed in about 10 - 15 seconds to get it out of the way and/or used on another mobile base .   this could reduce the overall cost if one needs more than one base .   there could be a little more attention paid to the manufacture so that the holes line up better , and there is a small problem with the bends not allowing it to all be at 90 degrees to the bottom and consequently the when the lumber is inserted , it is not square and plumb to the adjacent piece .   the instructions suck , but they should n't be needed for any intelligent person .   if you ca n't put it together without the instructions , you probably should not plug in any of your power tools .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "these splice sections fit the 4&quot ; woodstock international hose perfectly .   the hose will not lose much vacuum if they are just slipped on , but affixing the hoses with wire clamps will make it more permanent . there are two schools of thought for that proposition : if you just slip your hoses on the fittings , it will slip appart if you stumble over the hose while bumbling about your shop ; if your hose is out of the lanes of traffic , clamp them to avoid having to crawl behind that stack of plywood to reattach them .   if your tightly clamped hose is strung accross the floor , it will trip you , especially if you ca n't see the floor because you 're proudly hauling that newly completed vanity cabinet in for your adoring wife 's inspection . work safely and happy dust collecting!alex", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "i purchased four of the gates to use on my collection system .   they are very easy to use and install . the only thing that i wish that they had was a stop built into them to keep them open when in use in the vertical position .   i had purchased a competitor 's gate to finish the system that had this stop in them and it really helps to be able to mount the gate vertically and not horizontally to help keep it open . all in all , it is a great item and recommend it 's use to anyone .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "these are high quality and far better than the band type . these are clean looking and fit over the ridges on the pipe instead of crushing them . they tighten up with a screwdriver or wrench and really sinch down tight . because the dust collection hose is made with a continuous ridge and not seperate sections . you will have to cross over some ridges on the collection hose but , it still comes out clean . forget the old rubber hose type clamps and go with these you wo nt be sorry . now get out there and clamp some hose .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "i have found this sharpener and system to produce a rapid , accurate and beautiful edge on knives and woodworking equipment .   once you read the book for each jig you plan on using ( i recommend highly ) , it is very likely you will produce professional results on the first or second try .   the consistent angle of grind , slow water cooled stone and honing wheel produce an edge that quite often blows away the \" new out of box \" edge i 've found on many of my new knives and especially chisels . the video was more of a marketing tool than educational device so do n't worry if you are unable to get to a vcr right away .   the honing compound is pretty messy and you will wind up with water on your work surface if you sharpen long items such as chef knives or planer blades . compared to other systems , i rate this one as tops !", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "this is a great tool for joinery .   makes really strong joints and is fast and easy .   the bit is good quality .   i bought the tool after seeing it used in projects in the handyman magazine and reading the good reviews here at amazon .   after using it extensively to build cabinets , i agree with the reviews . the couple of areas for improvment:1 .   the end attachment is hard to screw into the body .   i leave it out entirely now , since i mostly work with 3/4 \" material and line the edge of the jig to the wood edge.2 .   the clamp barely works for 1 1/2 \"   material .   some pieces were 1/8 \" bigger , and i could n't clamp it .   they should have provided a slightly bigger clamp.3 .   after extensive use , the plastic body at the holes is reamed out .   a metal body would be nicer .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "this is a great system for joinery , as all the other reviews already attest .   if i was to do it again , though , i 'm not sure i 'd buy the rocket jig .   it is made of plastic and requires screwing in different - sized blocks onto the end of the jig for different thicknesses of wood .   for instance , there is one configuration for 1x material , another for 2x material , etc .   this means fiddling with the screws and blocks each time you need to join different sizes of wood , which not only is a little bit of a hassle , but also means that the screw holes will eventually get stripped - out . the included clamp is also poor quality , and i have already had to replace mine after a few projects .   there are a couple of new designs for the kreg jigs , and i think i would get one of these before buying the rocket jig again .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "the kreg system is very good and their brand of screws is part of their system . i have driven hundreds of them now and not one has stripped out or broken . this despite using an impact driver . kreg offers lots of lengths , different threads , specialty coatings and in various quantities . obviously , it would be costly to buy a box of every variety to cover every possible use , so you do have to research and order appropriately .   i got the box of a thousand and used an amazing number of them , so get a bigger box than you think you will need   and you will have a nice collection of spares for those unplanned projects in the future . the screws are good for other tasks and so do n't necessarily have to sit around waiting for the next kreg project . my order was prime , so the cost for a a big heavy box of quality screws was very reasonable . it was cheaper than other leading brand and its shipping costs .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "these are great screws in their own right . i love them for pocket hole joinery but i also am using them to hang new windows . the self tapping is terrific , the pan head does not go through the plastic flashing , the the square drive holds the screw securely while i am one handed drilling them while hanging onto the ladder ! i do not think they are weatherproof but after flashing and the trim , they will be protected enough . high quality screws , never have had one strip one me and the self tapping has never caused the board to split even right near the edge .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "kreg screws work for anything you want to hold together very tightly . i used to use drywall screws with cup washers to do this sort of job , but these round head screws never split the work even without washers . however the chief benefit to these screws is that you do n't need pilot holes , since the self drilling point does that job perfectly . also the reduced shank after the threads allows the top piece to be pulled up extremely tightly without drilling a clearance hole through it . all in all , a lot of good things for such a small package . amazingly for such a great product the cost is just about the same as drywall screws . i am totally blown away .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "i have built several cabinets using pocket hole screw technology . if you have n't tried pocket hole technology yet , make the switch , it works really well , but you need the special clamps . if you do a fair amount of woodworking it 's well worth the investment . note : when joining two pieces of wood with pocket hole screws , it pulls them in really tight , so you need to make sure the ends are square , else the screws will pull the joint crooked . you may want to investigate the technology before purchasing screws . there are several different screw types depending on the types of wood being joined . soft , hard , or ply woods . i love the technology , since i have purchased the full kit and several added clamps .", "label": "21"}
{"sentence": "the amount of the plug that sticks up after inserting it into the pocket hole seems excessive .   i was envisioning just having to do a little sanding to get them flush with the work piece , not having to use a rasp to get it down to a point where i could sand it .   i wound up using a scrap block of oak , with a pocket hole , to hold them in place while i used a rasp and wood file to get them down to a manageable size , before i put them in my work piece .", "label": "21"}

{"sentence": "i got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it . the dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background . i am happy with the number and look of the dionos , trees and volcanoes . however i give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy , and the set really smells bad . every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box . not sure if it 's the box it's - self or the contents .   i thought i would air it out a bit so i left the lid off over night , but when i entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it . i really do n't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage .   we play with them outside and they work fine for that .", "label": "3"}

( i ca n't speak for how much protection it offers for little boys , however . )   the smooth plastic without any real corners or edges makes cleaning effortless .   plus , the rubber bottom really does keep the seat from slipping across the floor .   plus , as an added bonus , it resembles the potty seat depicted in the \" once upon a potty \" video , so the kids can easily connect the concept to real life .   i highly recommend it , and ca n't imagine using any other seat !", "label": "3"}
