{"sentence": "i wish that i could say that i was one of the readers of   water for elephants , the well researched novel by sara gruen , who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930 's , but sadly i can't . i am not one who acclaims the romance of   the beautiful marlena , the circus horse rider and jacob , whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at cornell vet school .   instead , i am left thinking that perhaps , i should have read twilight instead .   the an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists , is that it takes the heart out of the book . though there was enough in the side characters , animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there i often found gruen 's phrasing annoying and clunky .   i have decided in all fairness to ms gruen and her many fans that i will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily .", "label": "5"}

{"sentence": "this app is an interesting calendar tool and astronomical guide to lunar activity .   on the main screen it shows you what the moon will be like today .   you have to enter in your location to get accurate information .   what i like is that by touching the calendar symbol at the top you get a monthly calendar and it shows the lunar status for every day of the upcoming month .   you can even look months ahead .   if you touch a day the lower   of the screen provides a larger view of the moon on the day you selected . by touching the data button you can review all of the lunar activity for that day with all of the scientific data provided to you .   the place button wants you to enter you location to provide you accurate lunar data .   you also have a clock function in order to advance the data or time to see the changes in the view of the moon . i gave this app 5 stars for the quality of the data provided and its uniqueness . it is interesting !", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "the secret of grisly manor is a nice little puzzle game in line with the other two fmg games i have , adventures of mosaika and the lost city .   however , grisly manor seems more like a prototype rather than a fully formed game and features present in the subsequent games are sorely missed here .   the journal is particular , which saves a great deal of time retracing the path back to previously - explored rooms to review clues to puzzles .   on the other hand , perhaps that was deliberate in order to artificially inflate the amount of time it takes to solve the game .   because as short as mosaika and lost city are , grisly is practically a blip .   the puzzle solutions in grisly were n't as involved either , which is troubling as the other games are not exactly complex .   the secret of grisly manor has atmosphere in its graphics and sound , but as a puzzle game , while acceptable , it does n't compare to the rest of fire maple games ' offerings , even at 99 cents .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "very useful to keep you aware of how many calories you are consuming and once you figure it out it is pretty easy to use . problems-- a big one is that people put incorrect info in the database so some of the counts are way off . especially on homemade foods . adjusting portion sizes is not simple if you use less than a given size on an existing item . getting out of an entry if you want to make a change or just check calories without adding a food is frustrating . even getting to the screen where you close out your day can be a real challenge sometimes . and if you do n't leave the program open- for example if you do n't want others using the device to see your weight- you have to hear all the notes about how you are starving yourself ... i think the program needs a help file with clear directions . if it has one i have nt seen it . overall- worth it . though now that i got an iphone with siri its easier to ask her to find calories counts for me .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this is sooo much better than fat secret which i was using on my phone . the kindle fire version of fat secret is crappy and does not mirror the online version at all . i like how simple this app is . it 's not trying to get you to join all kinds of communities and have online weight loss buddies which is not for me . it simply helps me track my food according to my goals . period . you can take advantage of other features but it does n't feel like too much more than a food diary . the graphics are minimal and clean so it actually feels like a notepad . the only thing i 'd change with the software is the ability to edit food once in you diary with a better edit button . over all i feel like this is the app to use if you simply want to track your eating for weight loss or nutrition .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "review for : rubbermaid dish brusha review for the humble dish brush .   i 'm not sure what it is about this one but i prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes i 've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets .   i 'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly . like a car that lets you still feel the road , the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots .   flip it around and you get nice scraping action .   use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots . this same flexibility means it wo n't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles , however even scrunched up it still continues to work great .   so hats off to this simple , classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time .", "label": "12"}
{"sentence": "i used these when i went on a month long safari . had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as i found in my experience that the high humidity , despite being in a tight container , drained most of the charge before i used them . took two sets of these lithium aa plus other brands as backup . did n't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after i had returned . they endured over 100f to a 32f at night , 90 % humidity , heavy rain , damn mosquitoes ( ah .. wait .. that was my gripe ) and worked very well . did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands .", "label": "12"}
{"sentence": "the flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the uvlo ( under - voltage lock out ) conditions of your electronics power supplies . today 's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone . they monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output , they shut off . normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it . lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life . maybe only 10 % to 15 % wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+the price is worth it .", "label": "12"}
{"sentence": "even so , they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter - lived batteries . however , when they die , they die ( i have found that they do n't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter - lived batteries do , when i turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes ) -- so keep an extra pair ( or however many you use in that specific device ) on hand for the day the inevitable happens . and i believe that lithium is more earth friendly -- and if i am not mistaken , these can be recycled ? ? ? ?", "label": "12"}

{"sentence": "these lithium batteries are great . they are long lasting , lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures . their \" best by \" date is often ten years or more . if you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold / freezing , then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures . they are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries , like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors . if you 're wealthy , then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables , but because of the relatively high cost , i only use these for \" special \" applications . otherwise i use alkalines or sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries .", "label": "12"}
