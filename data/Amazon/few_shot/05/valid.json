{"sentence": "i wish that i could say that i was one of the readers of   water for elephants , the well researched novel by sara gruen , who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930 's , but sadly i can't . i am not one who acclaims the romance of   the beautiful marlena , the circus horse rider and jacob , whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at cornell vet school .   instead , i am left thinking that perhaps , i should have read twilight instead .   the an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists , is that it takes the heart out of the book . though there was enough in the side characters , animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there i often found gruen 's phrasing annoying and clunky .   i have decided in all fairness to ms gruen and her many fans that i will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily .", "label": "5"}

{"sentence": "from what i ve heard , these ghost word generators can be eerily accurate , which may be a sign of true paranormal activity . it could just be plain cooincidence too . either way , ask your friends about personal ouija board experiences . using ouija boards have been reported to cause anything from hauntings to possesion , and honestly what is a ouija board but cardboard with numbers and letters drawn on it ? my point is , using things for the intent of talking to otherworldly creatures might bring trouble your way ... especialy on a computer program like this . also , the battery life issues are probably just the program using alot of power , but ghosts reportedly drain battery power , so it could be a sign of true activity if the power gets low while getting accurate word hits .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "i have used a couple of types of velcro cable ties in the past .   the best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with   a slot in the top , so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped .   these have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie .   you have to wrap it carefully ( and not particularly tightly ) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks .   if you unwrap the cable the tie falls off .   these a just considerably more annoying to use than the type i first described .   one other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you are n't going to be undoing them regularly .   true , but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost .", "label": "10"}

{"sentence": "these koss portapros are the last headphones you will ever need ( with a few exceptions ) . the lifetime warranty is great if they every break and certainly adds to the value of the purchase . the headphones for their size are surprisingly portable and fit almost any head . the metal band can occasionally catch your hair which is why it did n't receive 5 stars for comfort . this style of headphone by design does n't have very good noise cancellation , which is why you may want to pick up a pair of ear bud style headphones for loud environments , but the portapros still do a decent job with the task . sound quality is superb for this price range there is none better than the portapros and they can hold their own against headphones with double the price . these are a must have for people who want to get the most out of their music and videos . highly recommended !", "label": "10"}

{"sentence": "i bought a set of the koss porta pro headphones based on reviews for my creative nomad 2c mp3 player which i also got from amazon . i do n't think that a lot people realize that the limiting factor in listening to the mp3 format beside the size of the file is the set of headphones that you use . although they are not as accurate as my grado sr 60 phones , they sound very good and are light enough to be used on the go . for small headphones they sound pretty open and detailed . they bass is very good . so good in fact that i turned down the bass eq on my mp3 player just a bit to bring the midrange forward and keep the voices from getting tubby . the treble is very clean sounding . if you got an mp3 player , do yourself a favor and replace the stock headphones with these . i am pretty picky about sound quality . the koss porta pro headphones bridge the gap between light weight , portable and delivering a musical experience .", "label": "10"}
